Exhibit 10.1
 
BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), has granted to you the Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") specified in the Grant Summary above, which is incorporated into this Restricted Stock Units Agreement (the "Agreement") and deemed to be a part hereof. The RSUs have been granted to you under Section 6(e) of the 2012 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), on the terms and conditions specified in the Grant Summary and this Agreement. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement that are not specifically defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan.
 
The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (the "Committee") has granted to you on the Award Date an Award of RSUs as designated herein subject to the terms, conditions, and restrictions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. Each RSU shall represent the conditional right to receive, upon settlement of the RSU, one share of Bristol-Myers Squibb Common Stock ("Common Stock"), or, at the discretion of the Company, the cash equivalent thereof, (subject to any tax withholding as described in Section 4). RSUs include the right to receive dividend equivalents as specified in Section 5 ("Dividend Equivalents and Adjustments"). The purpose of such Award is to motivate and retain you as an employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, to encourage you to continue to give your best efforts for the Company's future success, and to increase your proprietary interest in the Company. Except as may be required by law, you are not required to make any payment (other than payments for taxes pursuant to Section 4 hereof) or provide any consideration other than the rendering of future services to the Company or a subsidiary of the Company.
 
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2, RSUs shall be subject to the restrictions and conditions set forth herein during the Restricted Period (as defined below). Vesting of the RSUs is conditioned upon you remaining continuously employed by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company from the Award Date until the relevant vesting date, subject to the provisions of this Section 2. Assuming satisfaction of such employment conditions, the RSUs will become vested and nonforfeitable as follows: one-third on the third anniversary of the Award Date; an additional one-third on the fourth anniversary of the Award Date; and the final one-third on the fifth anniversary of the Award Date. In the event you attain age 65 while still an employee of the Company or a subsidiary, all unvested RSUs held by you at least one year from the Award Date will become vested and non-forfeitable, and thereafter, so long as you remain an employee of the Company or a subsidiary after attaining age 65, all other RSUs will become 100% vested one year from the Award Date.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, your failure to return to active service with the Company or a subsidiary at the end of an approved leave of absence shall be deemed a termination of employment, subject to local law. During a leave of absence as defined in (ii) or (iii), although you will be considered to have been continuously employed by the Company or a subsidiary and not to have had a termination of employment under this Section 2, the Committee may specify that such leave period shall not be counted in determining the period of employment for purposes of the vesting of the RSUs. In such case, the vesting dates for unvested RSUs shall be extended by the length of any such leave of absence.
 
You acknowledge that your continued employment with the Company or a subsidiary and the grant of RSUs is sufficient consideration for this Agreement, including, without limitation, the restrictions imposed upon you by this Section 3.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by the Company, any subsidiary or affiliate or your employer ("Employer"), the ultimate liability for all income tax (including federal, state, local and non-U.S. taxes), social security, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you or deemed by the Company or the Employer to be an appropriate charge to you even if legally applicable to the Company or the Employer ("Tax-Related Items"), is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. You further acknowledge that the Company, any subsidiary or affiliate and/or the Employer: (a) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of RSUs, the conversion of the RSUs into shares of Common Stock or the receipt of an equivalent cash payment, the subsequent sale of any shares of Common Stock acquired at vesting and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalents; and, (b) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction between the Award Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Prior to the relevant taxable event, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, by your acceptance of the RSUs, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:
 
 
 
provided, however, if you are a Section 16 officer of the Company under the Exchange Act, then the Company will withhold shares of Common Stock upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is problematic under applicable tax or securities law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, in which case, the obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (a) and (b) above.
Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case you will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.
Finally, you agree to pay to the Company or the Employer, including through withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or the Employer, any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares or the proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock, if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4 to the contrary, to avoid a prohibited acceleration under Code Section 409A, if shares of Common Stock subject to RSUs will be sold on your behalf (or withheld) to satisfy any Tax-Related Items arising prior to the date of settlement of the RSUs for any portion of the RSUs that is considered nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A, then the number of shares sold on your behalf (or withheld) shall not exceed the number of shares that equals the liability for Tax-Related Items.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In no event shall the value, at any time, of the RSUs or any other payment under this Agreement be included as compensation or earnings for purposes of any other compensation, retirement, or benefit plan offered to employees of the Company or any subsidiary unless otherwise specifically provided for in such plan. The RSUs and the underlying shares of Common Stock (or their cash equivalent), and the income and value of the same are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes including, but not limited to, calculation of any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy or end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits, or similar payments.
 
In accepting the RSUs, you acknowledge, understand and agree that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding your participation in the Plan or your acquisition or sale of the underlying shares of Common Stock. You are hereby advised to consult with your own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding your participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.
 
Nothing in the Plan or this Agreement shall confer on you any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any subsidiary or any specific position or level of employment with the Company or any subsidiary or affect in any way the right of the Company or any subsidiary to terminate your employment without prior notice at any time for any reason or no reason.
 
The Committee shall have full authority and discretion, subject only to the express terms of the Plan, to decide all matters relating to the administration and interpretation of the Plan and this Agreement, and all such Committee determinations shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon the Company, you, and all interested parties. Any provision for distribution in settlement of your RSUs and other obligations hereunder (including cash amounts set aside under Section 5(a)(i)) shall be by means of bookkeeping entries on the books of the Company and shall not create in you or any beneficiary any right to, or claim against any, specific assets of the Company, nor result in the creation of any trust or escrow account for you or any beneficiary. You and any of your beneficiaries entitled to any settlement or distribution hereunder shall be a general creditor of the Company.
 
You are required to accept the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement prior to the first vest date in order for you to receive the Award granted to you hereunder. If you wish to decline this Award, you must reject this Agreement prior to the first vest date. For your benefit, if you have not rejected the Agreement prior to the first vest date, you will be deemed to have automatically accepted this Award and all the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Deemed acceptance will allow the shares to be released to you in a timely manner.
 
This Agreement shall be subject to the terms of the Plan, as amended from time to time, except that, subject to Sections 19 and 22 below, the Award which is the subject of this Agreement may not be materially adversely affected by any amendment or termination of the Plan approved after the Award Date without your written consent.
 
The various provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
 
This Agreement and Award grant shall be governed by the substantive laws (but not the choice of law rules) of the State of New York. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises under this RSU grant or Agreement, the parties hereby submit to and consent to the jurisdiction of the State of New York, agree that such litigation shall be conducted in the courts of New York, New York, or the federal courts for the United States for the Southern District of New York, and no other courts where this RSU grant is made and/or performed.
 
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors, assigns, and heirs of the respective parties.
 
You hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement by and among, as applicable, your Employer, the Company and its subsidiaries for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan.
You understand that the Company, any subsidiary and/or your Employer may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social security number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to shares awarded, canceled, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan ("Data").
You understand that Data may be transferred to Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by the Company in the future, which assists in the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. You understand that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipient's country (e.g. the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You understand that if you reside outside the United States, you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the Company, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a broker, escrow agent or other third party with whom the shares of Common Stock received upon vesting of the RSUs may be deposited. You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan. You understand that if you reside outside the United States, you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting your local human resources representative. Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke your consent, your employment status or service and career with the Employer will not be adversely affected; the only adverse consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant you RSUs or other equity awards or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, you understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan. For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.
 
The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic systems established and maintained by the Company or a third-party designated by the Company.
 
If you have received this Agreement or any other document related to the Plan translated into a language other than English and if the meaning of the translated version is different than the English version, the English version will control.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan or this Agreement, unless there is an available exemption from any registration, qualification or other legal requirement applicable to the shares of Common Stock, you understand that the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the vesting of the RSUs, if the issuance of such Common Stock shall constitute a violation by you or the Company of any provision of law or regulation of any governmental authority. Further, you agree that the Company shall have unilateral authority to amend the Plan and the Agreement without your consent to the extent necessary to comply with securities or other laws applicable to issuance of shares. Any determination by the Company in this regard shall be final, binding and conclusive.
 
This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties. This Agreement shall not be modified or amended except in writing duly signed by the parties, except that the Company may adopt a modification or amendment to the Agreement that is not materially adverse to you in writing signed only by the Company. Any waiver of any right or failure to perform under this Agreement shall be in writing signed by the party granting the waiver and shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent failure to perform.
 
Your RSUs shall be subject to any special provisions set forth in the Addendum to this Agreement for your country, if any. If you relocate to one of the countries included in the Addendum during the Restricted Period, the special provisions for such country shall apply to you, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such provisions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons. The Addendum, if any, constitutes part of this Agreement.
 
The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on your participation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require you to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.
 
I have read this Agreement in its entirety. I understand that this Award has been granted to provide a means for me to acquire and/or expand an ownership position in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. I acknowledge and agree that sales of shares will be subject to the Company's policies regulating trading by employees. In accepting this Award, I hereby agree that Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, or such other vendor as the Company may choose to administer the Plan, may provide the Company with any and all account information for the administration of this Award.
I hereby agree to all the terms, restrictions and conditions set forth in the Agreement.

Exhibit 10.2
 
BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), has granted to you the Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") specified in the Grant Summary above, which is incorporated into this Restricted Stock Units Agreement (the "Agreement") and deemed to be a part hereof. The RSUs have been granted to you under Section 6(e) of the 2012 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), on the terms and conditions specified in the Grant Summary and this Agreement. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement that are not specifically defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan.
 
The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (the "Committee") has granted to you on the Award Date an Award of RSUs as designated herein subject to the terms, conditions, and restrictions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. Each RSU shall represent the conditional right to receive, upon settlement of the RSU, one share of Bristol-Myers Squibb Common Stock ("Common Stock"), or, at the discretion of the Company, the cash equivalent thereof, (subject to any tax withholding as described in Section 4). RSUs include the right to receive dividend equivalents as specified in Section 5 ("Dividend Equivalents and Adjustments"). The purpose of such Award is to motivate and retain you as an employee of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, to encourage you to continue to give your best efforts for the Company's future success, and to increase your proprietary interest in the Company. Except as may be required by law, you are not required to make any payment (other than payments for taxes pursuant to Section 4 hereof) or provide any consideration other than the rendering of future services to the Company or a subsidiary of the Company.
 
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2, RSUs shall be subject to the restrictions and conditions set forth herein during the Restricted Period (as defined below). Vesting of the RSUs is conditioned upon you remaining continuously employed by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company from the Award Date until the relevant vesting date, subject to the provisions of this Section 2. Assuming satisfaction of such employment conditions, 25% of the RSUs shall vest on each of the first four anniversaries of the Award Date. In the event you attain age 65 while still an employee of the Company or a subsidiary, all unvested RSUs held by you at least one year from the Award Date will become vested and non-forfeitable, and thereafter, so long as you remain an employee of the Company or a subsidiary after attaining age 65, all other RSUs will become 100% vested one year from the Award Date.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, your failure to return to active service with the Company or a subsidiary at the end of an approved leave of absence shall be deemed a termination of employment, subject to local law. During a leave of absence as defined in (ii) or (iii), although you will be considered to have been continuously employed by the Company or a subsidiary and not to have had a termination of employment under this Section 2, the Committee may specify that such leave period shall not be counted in determining the period of employment for purposes of the vesting of the RSUs. In such case, the vesting dates for unvested RSUs shall be extended by the length of any such leave of absence.
 
You acknowledge that your continued employment with the Company or a subsidiary and the grant of RSUs is sufficient consideration for this Agreement, including, without limitation, the restrictions imposed upon you by this Section 3.
