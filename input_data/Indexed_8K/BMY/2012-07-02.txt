Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Merger Agreement
On June 29, 2012, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, a Delaware corporation ("Bristol-Myers Squibb"), B&R Acquisition Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb ("Merger Sub") and Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Amylin" or the "Company"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement").
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Merger Sub will commence a tender offer (the "Offer") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Amylin (the "Shares") at a price of $31.00 per Share, net to the seller in cash but subject to any required withholding taxes (the "Offer Price").
The Merger Agreement provides that Merger Sub will commence the Offer within 7 business days after June 29, 2012, and that the Offer will remain open for at least 20 business days.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, after the consummation of the Offer, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Amylin (the "Merger"), with Amylin surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb. Upon completion of the Merger, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time") (other than Shares that are held by Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merger Sub, Amylin in treasury or stockholders exercising their appraisal rights under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL")) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash (without interest).
On June 29, 2012, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, each of Daniel M. Bradbury, Mark G. Folleta, Orville G. Kolterman and Mark J. Gergen entered into a Tender and Support Agreement (the "Support Agreement") with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merger Sub and, solely with respect to certain sections thereof, Amylin. Collectively, these stockholders have ownership of an aggregate of 4,823,527 Shares (including Shares represented by vested and unvested options they hold), or approximately 3% of the Shares (taking into account, for purposes of determining the aggregate Shares, Amylin's outstanding Shares and assuming the exercise of only the vested and unvested options held by the stockholders who entered into the Support Agreement).
If Merger Sub holds 90% or more of the outstanding Shares immediately following consummation of the Offer, Amylin, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merger Sub will take necessary and appropriate actions to effect a "short-form" merger under the DGCL as promptly as reasonably practicable without additional approval by Amylin's stockholders. Otherwise, Amylin will hold a special stockholders' meeting to obtain stockholder approval of the Merger.
The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for Shares tendered into the Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and there being validly tendered into the Offer (and not properly withdrawn prior to any then scheduled expiration of the Offer) a number of Shares that constitutes at least a majority of the total number of the issued and outstanding Shares determined on a fully-diluted basis (such condition, the "Minimum Condition"). The Minimum Condition may be waived by Bristol-Myers Squibb or Merger Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company. The consummation of the Offer is not subject to any financing condition.
In addition, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Amylin has granted Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option"), exercisable only after Merger Sub has accepted and purchased Shares tendered in the Offer and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, to purchase from Amylin that number of Shares equal to the number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares held by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merger Sub at the time of the exercise of the Top-Up Option, will constitute one Share more than 90% of the total Shares then outstanding (determined after giving effect to the issuance of the Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option).
The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of Amylin, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merger Sub. The Company has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course until the earlier of the termination of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time. The Company has also agreed not to solicit or initiate discussions with third parties regarding other proposals to acquire Amylin and to certain restrictions on its ability to respond to any such proposals.
 
The Merger Agreement also includes customary termination provisions for both Amylin and Bristol-Myers Squibb and provides that, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances, Amylin must pay Bristol-Myers Squibb a termination fee of $160,000,000.
The Merger Agreement also provides that either party may specifically enforce the other party's obligations under the Merger Agreement.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Bristol-Myers Squibb has entered into an Assumption Agreement pursuant to which it has agreed to assume certain of Amylin's payments relating to a revenue sharing obligation under the Settlement and Termination Agreement entered into on November 7, 2011 with Eli Lilly and Company. The Assumption Agreement is described below under Item 8.01.
The Company's 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2014 will be treated in accordance with the terms of its Indenture and holders of these Notes will be notified of their repurchase and other rights pursuant to its terms.
The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for the purposes of the Merger Agreement, were made as of specific dates, were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement and may not have been intended to be statements of fact but, rather, as a method of allocating risk and governing the contractual rights and relationships among the parties to the Merger Agreement. In addition, such representations, warranties and covenants may have been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected in the text of the Merger Agreement and may apply standards of materiality and other qualifications and limitations in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by Bristol-Myers Squibb's stockholders. None of Bristol-Myers Squibb's stockholders or any other third parties should rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of Amylin, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.
The Merger Agreement and this summary are not intended to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about Amylin or Bristol-Myers Squibb. The foregoing description of the Offer, the Merger and the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
(PRINCETON, N.J., LONDON, and SAN DIEGO, June 29, 2012) - (NYSE: BMY) and (NASDAQ: AMLN) announced today that Bristol-Myers Squibb will acquire Amylin for $31.00 per share in cash, pursuant to a cash tender offer and second step merger, or an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.3 billion. The total value of the transaction, including Amylin's net debt and a contractual payment obligation to Eli Lilly & Company, together totaling about $1.7 billion, is approximately $7 billion. The acquisition has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Amylin. The board of directors of Amylin has unanimously recommended that Amylin's stockholders tender their shares into the tender offer.
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca (LSE:AZN) announced today that, following the completion of Bristol-Myers Squibb's acquisition of Amylin, the companies will enter into collaboration arrangements, based on the framework of the existing diabetes alliance, regarding the development and commercialization of Amylin's portfolio of products. Following completion of Bristol-Myers Squibb's acquisition of Amylin, AstraZeneca will make a payment to Amylin, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb, in the amount of approximately $3.4 billion in cash. Profits and losses arising from the collaboration will be shared equally. In addition, AstraZeneca has the option, exercisable at its sole discretion following the closing of the acquisition, to establish equal governance rights over key strategic and financial decisions regarding the collaboration, upon the payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb of an additional $135 million. These collaboration arrangements have been approved by the boards of directors of Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca.
Amylin is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative medicines for patients with diabetes and other metabolic diseases. Amylin's primary focus is on the research, development and commercialization of a franchise of GLP-1 agonists, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
"Amylin's innovative diabetes portfolio, talented people and state-of-the art manufacturing facility complement our long-standing leadership in metabolics," said , chief executive officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb. "We are pleased to be able to strengthen the portfolio we have built to help patients with diabetes by building on the success Amylin has had with its GLP-1 franchise. The acquisition of Amylin by Bristol-Myers Squibb is also a unique way for Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca to expand the alliance between the two companies, and it demonstrates Bristol-Myers Squibb's innovative and targeted approach to partnerships and business development."
Lamberto Andreotti
Simon Lowth, interim chief executive officer of AstraZeneca, said: "This is a compelling proposition that will have an immediate positive impact on revenues and is fully in line with our stated partnering strategy to enhance top-line growth and strengthen our late stage pipeline. The broadening of our diabetes collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb is another important step towards creating a leadership position in the treatment of a disease with growing unmet medical need that is reaching epidemic proportions in many areas of the world. The combined development, regulatory and commercial strengths of the AstraZeneca and Bristol Myers-Squibb alliance for diabetes provides an excellent platform to unlock the potential of Amylin's differentiated treatments for the benefit of patients worldwide and for our shareholders."
"We are pleased to announce this transaction that provides substantial value for Amylin shareholders," said Daniel M. Bradbury, president and chief executive officer of Amylin. "Over the last several months, our Board of Directors, with the assistance of our financial and legal advisors, has been actively engaged in a robust and thorough strategic process designed to maximize the value of our unique diabetes franchise. I strongly believe that we have accomplished that objective. Our recent U.S. launch of BYDUREON, the first ever once-weekly therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes, solidified our position as a driving force in the fight against this rising global epidemic. Importantly, this transaction with Bristol-Myers Squibb and
their alliance with AstraZeneca provide the means to maximize the potential and impact of Amylin's innovative diabetes therapies and reach more patients around the world with treatment options to help manage their disease. In addition, I would like to acknowledge and thank the dedicated employees of Amylin whose tireless efforts are responsible for creating the tremendous value that is being recognized today by two of the most respected companies in the pharmaceutical industry."
