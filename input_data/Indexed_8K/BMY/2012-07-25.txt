Bristol-Myers Squibb is adjusting its 2012 GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.90 to $2.00 to $1.78 to $1.88. This GAAP EPS guidance does not include the impact of the planned acquisition of Amylin, or of the new collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca relating to certain Amylin assets.
The Company is also confirming its non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.90 to $2.00. This non-GAAP EPS guidance includes the expected negative impact of $0.03 per share related to the acquisition of Amylin and the new collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca.

This guidance does not include the impact of any potential strategic acquisition and divestitures, or any specified items that have not yet been identified and quantified. The non-GAAP 2012 guidance also excludes specified items as discussed under "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information." The estimated non-GAAP EPS impact of the planned Amylin acquisition and new AstraZeneca collaboration agreement excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs and other costs associated with the transactions.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related earnings per share information. These measures are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, significant gains and losses and other specified items. Among the items in GAAP measures but excluded for purposes of determining adjusted earnings and other adjusted measures are: restructuring and other exit costs; accelerated depreciation charges; IPRD and asset impairments; charges and recoveries relating to significant legal proceedings; upfront, milestone and other licensing payments for in-licensing of products that have not achieved regulatory approval which are immediately expensed; and significant tax events. This information is intended to enhance an investor's overall understanding of the company's past financial performance and prospects for the future. Non-GAAP financial measures provide the company and its investors with an indication of the company's baseline performance before items that are considered by the company not to be reflective of the company's ongoing results. The company uses non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP marketing, selling and administrative expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, and non-GAAP other income and expense measures to set internal budgets, manage costs, allocate resources, and plan and forecast future periods. Non-GAAP effective tax rate measures are primarily used to plan and forecast future periods. Non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures are primary indicators the company uses as a basis for evaluating company performance, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
