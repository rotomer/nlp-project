contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the indemnified party has determined, in its reasonable judgment, that there may be one or more defenses available to the indemnified party which may be different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party and that the existence of such different or additional defenses creates, in the reasonable judgment of such indemnified party, a conflict in connection with the joint representation of the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party shall have the right to employ
 
separate counsel and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel for the indemnified party shall be paid by the indemnifying party; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall only be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of a single law firm (and any reasonably necessary local counsel) employed by all of the indemnified parties unless any indemnified party has determined, in its reasonable judgment, that there may be one or more defenses available to it which may be different from or additional to those available to another indemnified party and that the existence of such different or additional defense creates, in its reasonable judgment, a conflict in connection with the joint representation of the indemnified parties, in which case the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of a separate single law firm (and any reasonably necessary local counsel) employed by each such indemnified party to which such conflict relates. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting
 
expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such Securities and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 10 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 10 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
11. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase;
Default by an Underwriter
 
provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 11, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
12. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 10 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7, 9 and 10 hereof shall survive the termination or cancelation of this Agreement.

Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
Notices
 
16. . This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers, directors, employees, agents and controlling persons referred to in Section 10 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
Successors
17. . Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.

The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

ANNEX I
Pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Underwriting Agreement, Deloitte & Touche LLP shall furnish letters to the Underwriters to the effect that:
(i) They are independent certified public accountants with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder;
(ii) In their opinion, the financial statements and any supplementary financial information and schedules (and, if applicable, financial forecasts and/or pro forma financial information) examined by them and included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related published rules and regulations thereunder; and, if applicable, they have made a review in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the consolidated interim financial statements, selected financial data, pro forma financial information, financial forecasts and/or condensed financial statements derived from audited financial statements of the Company for the periods specified in such letter, as indicated in their reports thereon, copies of which have been furnished to the representatives of the Underwriters (the "Representatives") such term to include an Underwriter or Underwriters who act without any firm being designated as its or their representatives and are attached to such letters;
(iii) They have made a review in accordance with standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants of the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus and/or included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by reference into the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus as indicated in their reports thereon copies of which have been separately furnished to the Representatives; and on the basis of specified procedures including inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters regarding whether the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements referred to in paragraph (vi)(A)(i) below comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published rules and regulations;
(iv) The unaudited selected financial information with respect to the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the Company for the three most recent fiscal years included in the Prospectus and included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year agrees with the corresponding amounts (after restatement where applicable) in the audited consolidated financial statements for such three fiscal years which were included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such fiscal years;
 
(v) On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute books of the Company and its subsidiaries since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:

(B) any other unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not agree with the corresponding items in the unaudited consolidated financial statements from which such data and items were derived, and any such unaudited data and items were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the corresponding amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
(C) the unaudited financial statements which were not included in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus but from which were derived the unaudited condensed financial statements referred to in clause (A) and any unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus and referred to in clause (B) were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the basis for the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;
(D) any unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form
 
in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the published rules and regulations thereunder or the pro forma adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the compilation of those statements;
(E) as of a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of such letter, there have been any changes in the consolidated common stock (other than issuances of common stock upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights or from the Company's purchase of its common stock, upon earn-outs of performance shares and upon conversions of convertible securities, in each case which were outstanding on the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus) or any increase in the consolidated long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries, or any decreases in consolidated net current assets or stockholders' equity or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus, except in each case for changes, increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
(F) for the period from the date of the latest financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus to the specified date referred to in clause (E) there were any decreases in consolidated net sales or the total or per share amounts of consolidated net income or other items specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with the comparable period of the preceding year and with any other period of corresponding length specified by the Representatives, except in each case for increases or decreases which the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
In addition to the examination referred to in their report(s) included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus and the limited procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other procedures referred to in paragraphs (iii) and (vi) above, they have carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information specified by the Representatives which are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, which appear in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference) or in Part II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement specified by the Representatives or in documents incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus specified by the Representatives, and have compared certain of such amounts, percentages and financial information with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries and have found them to be in agreement.

notice to the Holders, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for such redemption. No redemption pursuant to (b) above may be made unless the Company shall have received an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States results in a substantial probability that the Company will or may be required to pay the Additional Amounts and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by an officer of the Company duly authorized in or pursuant to a Board Resolution stating, that based on such opinion, the Company is entitled to redeem the Notes pursuant to their terms.
Special Mandatory Redemption of Notes
In the event that (i) the Company does not purchase a majority of shares of outstanding common stock of Amylin on a fully diluted basis on or prior to December 31, 2012, or (ii) the Merger Agreement is terminated at any time prior thereto, then the Company will redeem all of the Notes (the "Special Mandatory Redemption") on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the date of original issuance to but excluding the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. The "Special Mandatory Redemption Date" means the earlier to occur of (1) December 31, 2012, if the Company has not purchased a majority of shares of outstanding common stock of Amylin on a fully diluted basis on or prior to December 31, 2012, or (2) the 30th day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the first Business Day thereafter) following the termination of the Merger Agreement for any reason.
The Company will cause the notice of Special Mandatory Redemption to be distributed, with a copy to the Trustee, within five Business Days after the occurrence of the event triggering the Special Mandatory Redemption to each Holder. If funds sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price of all Notes to be redeemed on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date are deposited with the Trustee on or before such Special Mandatory Redemption Date, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Notes will cease to bear interest.
The provisions relating to the Special Mandatory Redemption set forth above may not be waived or modified without the written consent of Holders of at least 90% in principal amount of the Notes Outstanding.
Additional Issues
The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the Holders of the Notes, create and issue additional Notes. Any such additional Notes will rank equally and ratably with the Notes and will have the same interest rate, maturity date and other terms as the Notes herein provided for, except for the issue date, the public offering price, the payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date or except for the first payment of interest following the issue date of such additional Notes. Any such additional Notes, together with the Notes herein provided for, will constitute a single series of Securities under the Indenture and, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, will be fungible with the Notes herein provided for. Any additional Notes may be issued by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or a supplement to the Indenture.
 
Notes in Definitive Form
If (1) the depositary is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of notice thereof, (2) an Event of Default has occurred with regard to the Notes and has not been cured or waived, or (3) the Company at any time and in its sole discretion determines not to have the Notes represented by Global Securities, the Company may issue Notes in definitive form in exchange for Notes issued in the form of Global Securities. In any such instance, an owner of a beneficial interest in the Notes will be entitled to physical delivery in definitive form of Notes represented by this Note, equal in principal amount to such beneficial interest and to have such Notes registered in its name as shall be established in a Company Order.
Sinking Fund
The Notes will not be subject to any sinking fund.
Default
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
Miscellaneous
Any money that the Company deposits with the Trustee or any Paying Agent for the payment of principal or any interest on this Note that remains unclaimed for two years after the date upon which the principal and interest are due and payable, will be repaid to the Company upon the Company's request unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of any applicable unclaimed property law. After that time, unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of any unclaimed property law, the Holder of this Note will be able to seek any payment to which such Holder may be entitled to collect only from the Company.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and any premium and any interest on, this Note at the place, rate and respective times and in the coin or currency herein and in the Indenture prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions therein set forth, including the deposit of certain trust funds in trust, at the Company's option, either the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by, and the obligations under, the Notes and to have satisfied all the obligations (with certain exceptions) under the Indenture relating to the Notes or the Company shall cease to be under any obligation to comply with any term, provision or condition of certain restrictive covenants or provisions with respect to the Notes.
The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000. Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount and Stated Maturity of Notes of other authorized denominations at the office or agency

At or prior to the time of giving any notice of redemption to the Holders of any Notes to be redeemed, the Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee setting forth the calculation of the Redemption Price applicable to such redemption.

(2) to any Holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of the Notes, or that is a fiduciary or partnership, but only to the extent that the beneficial owner, a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a member of the partnership would not have been entitled to the payment of an additional amount had such beneficial owner, beneficiary, settlor or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment;
(3) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely because the beneficial owner or any other person failed to comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the United States Treasury Department or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(4) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed other than by deduction or withholding by the Company or a Paying Agent from the payment;
(5) to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely because of a change in law, regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective after the day on which the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
 
(6) to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth or personal property tax or any similar tax, assessment or governmental charge;
(7) to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge any paying agent (which term may include the Company) must withhold from any payment of principal of or interest on any note, if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other paying agent;

(9) in the case of any combination of the above items.

"Non-U.S. Holder" means (a) an individual that is a nonresident alien, (b) a corporation organized or created under non-U.S. law, or (c) an estate or trust that is not taxable in the U.S. on its worldwide income.
Redemption Upon a Tax Event

No redemption pursuant to (b) above may be made unless the Company shall have received an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States results in a substantial probability that the Company will or may be required to pay the Additional Amounts and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by an officer of the Company duly authorized in or pursuant to a Board Resolution stating, that based on such opinion, the Company is entitled to redeem the Notes pursuant to their terms.
Special Mandatory Redemption of Notes
In the event that (i) the Company does not purchase a majority of shares of outstanding common stock of Amylin on a fully diluted basis on or prior to December 31, 2012, or (ii) the Merger Agreement is terminated at any time prior thereto, then the Company will redeem all of the Notes (the "Special Mandatory Redemption") on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the date of original issuance to but excluding the Special Mandatory Redemption Date.

Any additional Notes may be issued by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or a supplement to the Indenture.
 
Notes in Definitive Form

Default
If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
Miscellaneous

c. to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely because the beneficial owner or any other person failed to comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the United States Treasury Department or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
d. to any tax, assessment or governmental charge that is imposed other than by deduction or withholding by the Company or a Paying Agent from the payment;

notice to the Holders, at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for such redemption. No redemption pursuant to (b) above may be made unless the Company shall have received an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States results in a substantial probability that the Company will or may be required to pay the Additional Amounts and the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee a certificate, signed by an officer of the Company duly authorized in or pursuant to a Board Resolution stating, that based on such opinion, the Company is entitled to redeem the Notes pursuant to their terms.

In the event that (i) the Company does not purchase a majority of shares of outstanding common stock of Amylin on a fully diluted basis on or prior to December 31, 2012, or (ii) the Merger Agreement is terminated at any time prior thereto, then the Company will redeem all of the Notes (the "Special Mandatory Redemption") on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the date of original issuance to but excluding the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. The "Special Mandatory Redemption Date" means the earlier to occur of (1) December 31, 2012, if the Company has not purchased a majority of shares of outstanding common stock of Amylin on a fully diluted basis on or prior to December 31, 2012, or (2) the 30th day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the first Business Day thereafter) following the termination of the Merger Agreement for any reason.

If funds sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price of all Notes to be redeemed on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date are deposited with the Trustee on or before such Special Mandatory Redemption Date, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Notes will cease to bear interest.
The provisions relating to the Special Mandatory Redemption set forth above may not be waived or modified without the written consent of Holders of at least 90% in principal amount of the Notes Outstanding.

SECTION 2.5. .
Extension of Maturity Date
(a) The Company may, by sending an Extension Letter to CBNA (in which case CBNA shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders), during the period of not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to any anniversary of the Effective Date, request that the Lenders extend the Maturity Date at the time in effect to the first anniversary of the Maturity Date then in effect. Each Lender, acting in its sole discretion, shall, by notice to CBNA given not more than 20 days after the date of the Extension Letter, advise CBNA in writing whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension (each Lender that so advises CBNA that it will not extend the Maturity Date, being referred to herein as a ""); provided that any Lender that does not advise CBNA by the 20th day after the date of the Extension Letter shall be deemed to be a Non-extending Lender. The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to agree.
Non-extending Lender
(b) (i) If Lenders holding Commitments that aggregate more than 50% of the total Commitments on the 20th day after the date of the Extension Letter shall not have agreed to extend the Maturity Date, then the Maturity Date shall not be so extended and the outstanding principal balance of all Loans and other amounts payable hereunder shall be payable on such Maturity Date.
(ii) If (and only if) Lenders holding Commitments that aggregate more than 50% of the total Commitments on the 20th day after the date of the Extension Letter shall have agreed to extend the Maturity Date, then the Maturity Date applicable to the Lenders that shall so have agreed shall be the first anniversary of the current Maturity Date. In the event of such extension, the Commitment of each Non-extending Lender shall terminate on the Maturity Date in effect prior to such extension, all Loans and other amounts payable hereunder to such Non-extending Lenders shall become due and payable on such Maturity Date and the total Commitment of the Lenders hereunder shall be reduced by the Commitments of Non-extending Lenders so terminated on such Maturity Date.
(c) In the event that the conditions of clause (ii) of paragraph (b) above have been satisfied, the Company shall have the right on or before the Maturity Date in effect prior to the requested extension, at its own expense, to require any Non-extending Lender to transfer and assign without recourse (except as to title and the absence of Liens created by it) (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 8.4) all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more banks or other financial institutions identified to the Non-extending Lender, which may include any Lender which agrees to accept such transfer and assignment (each an ""), that (x) such Additional Commitment Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of CBNA and the Company (such approvals not to be unreasonably withheld), (y) such assignment shall become effective as of a date specified by the Company (which shall not be later than the Maturity Date in effect prior to the requested extension) and (z) the Additional Commitment Lender shall pay to such Non-extending Lender in immediately available funds on the effective date of such assignment the principal of and interest accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made by it hereunder and all other amounts accrued for its account or owed to it hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no extension of the Maturity Date shall become effective unless, on the Maturity Date in effect
Additional Commitment Lender
provided
 
prior to the requested extension the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.2 shall be satisfied or waived (with all references in such paragraphs to a Borrowing being deemed to be references to the current Maturity Date) and CBNA shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such Maturity Date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Company.
SECTION 2.6. . (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds in Dollars or in the applicable Alternative Currency, as the case may be, to the account of CBNA or an Affiliate thereof most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders, by 2:00 p.m., New York City time (or, in the case of any Competitive Loan with respect to which a Borrower shall have requested funding in another jurisdiction, to such account in such jurisdiction as CBNA shall designate for such purpose by notice to the applicable Lenders, by 2:00 p.m., local time). CBNA will make such Loans available to such Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of such Borrower maintained with CBNA in New York City (or, in the case of any Loan with respect to which such Borrower shall have requested funding in another jurisdiction, to such account in such jurisdiction as such Borrower shall have designated in the applicable Borrowing Request or Competitive Bid Request).
Funding of Borrowings
(b) Unless CBNA shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to CBNA such Lender's share of such Borrowing, CBNA may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to such Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to CBNA, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to CBNA forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to CBNA, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate on the applicable Borrowing; that no repayment by such Borrower pursuant to this sentence shall be deemed to be a prepayment for purposes of Section 2.15. If such Lender pays such amount to CBNA, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
provided
SECTION 2.7. . (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type and in the Currency specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) may elect to convert such Borrowing (if denominated in Dollars) to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods or Currencies therefor, all as provided in this Section. Eurocurrency Loans may not be converted to Loans of a different Type. The Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Competitive Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
Interest Elections
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) shall notify CBNA of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.3 if the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf
 
of any other Borrower) were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery, telecopy or electronic transmission to CBNA of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by CBNA and signed by the Company.
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.2:
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, (A) the Currency of the resulting Borrowing and (B) the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify (x) an Interest Period, then the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration or (y) a Currency, then the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrowing Subsidiary) shall be deemed to have selected a Borrowing denominated in Dollars (in the case of an initial Eurocurrency Borrowing) or the same Currency as the Eurocurrency Borrowing being continued.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, CBNA shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of any other Borrower) fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing (i) if denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) if denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be converted to a one month Interest Period denominated in the same Currency as the Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing being continued. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and CBNA, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
SECTION 2.8. . (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
Termination and Reduction of Commitments
 
(b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures plus the Competitive Loan Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.
provided
(c) The Company shall notify CBNA of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, CBNA shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to CBNA on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
provided
SECTION 2.9. . (a) Each Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to CBNA for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of its Revolving Loans on the Maturity Date and (ii) to CBNA for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Competitive Loan on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan.
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt
(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(c) CBNA shall maintain a Register pursuant to subsection 8.4(d), and an account for each Lender in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder and any promissory note evidencing such Loan, the Class, Type and Currency thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by CBNA hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.
(d) The entries made in the Register and the accounts of each Lender maintained pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section shall be evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; that the failure of any Lender or CBNA to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
prima
facie
provided
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note for its Competitive Loans and a promissory note for its Revolving Loans. In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by CBNA. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 8.4) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its assigns).
 
SECTION 2.10. . (a) The applicable Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section; that no Borrower shall have the right to prepay any Competitive Loan without the prior consent of the Lender thereof (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
Prepayment of Loans

Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.8, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.8. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, CBNA shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.2. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12.

(c) Each Fixed Rate Loan shall bear interest at the Fixed Rate applicable to such Loan.
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 1% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 1% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

provided
(f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at time when the Alternate Base Rate is based on clause (a) of the first sentence of the definition of Alternate Base Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

(b) CBNA is advised by the Required Lenders (or, in the case of a Eurocurrency Competitive Loan, the Lender that is required to make such Loan) that the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
CBNA shall give notice thereof to the Company (on its own behalf or on behalf of the applicable Borrower) and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy or electronic transmission, as applicable, as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until CBNA notifies the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective, (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, such

(b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 60-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
provided
further

(f) If the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan (other than a Competitive Loan) to a Borrowing Subsidiary incorporated or organized in a jurisdiction other than the United States or any state thereof is increased (or the amount of any sum received or receivable by any Lender or its lending office is reduced) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, by reason of the fact that such Borrowing Subsidiary is incorporated or organized in a jurisdiction outside of the United States, such Borrowing Subsidiary shall indemnify such Lender for such increased cost or reduction within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to CBNA), which such Lender shall make within sixty (60) days from the day such Lender has notice of such increased cost or reduction.

In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the present value of the excess, if any, of (i) its cost of obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid, refinanced or not borrowed (assumed to be the LIBO Rate that would have been applicable thereto) for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, refinancing or failure to borrow or refinance to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow or refinance the Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would be realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds so paid, prepaid or not borrowed or refinanced for such period or Interest Period, as the case may be. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section and setting forth in reasonable detail the manner in which such amount or amounts shall have been determined shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Such Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

In addition, each Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Lender. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.16(g), a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section 2.16(g) that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.

(ii) If a payment made to a Lender (or participant) under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the applicable Borrower and CBNA, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the applicable Borrower or CBNA, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the applicable Borrower or CBNA as may be necessary for such Borrower or CBNA to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
 
(h) A Lender (or participant) that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrowing Subsidiary is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrowing Subsidiary (with a copy to CBNA), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrowing Subsidiary, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate, that such Lender (or participant) is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender (or participant).
provided
(i) The relevant Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Lender, or to pay any Additional Amounts to any Lender, in respect of any withholding tax pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) above to the extent that (i) such withholding tax is imposed by the United States and the obligation to withhold amounts with respect to such withholding tax was in effect and would apply to amounts payable to such Lender on the date such Lender became a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a participant, on the date such participant became a participant hereunder) or, with respect to payments to a New Lending Office, the date such Lender designated such New Lending Office with respect to a Loan or, with respect to payments by a Borrower pursuant to a Competitive Loan, as of the date the Company accepts a Competitive Bid pursuant to Section 2.4(d); , , that this clause (i) shall not apply to any Lender (or participant) if the assignment, participation, transfer or designation of a New Lending Office was made at the request of the relevant Borrower or was made pursuant to Section 2.19; and , , that this clause (i) shall not apply to the extent the indemnity payment or Additional Amounts any Lender (or participant) would be entitled to receive (without regard to this clause (i)) do not exceed the indemnity payment or Additional Amounts that the Lender (or participant) making the assignment, participation, transfer or designation of such New Lending Office would have been entitled to receive in the absence of such assignment, participation, transfer or designation, or (ii) the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Lender (or participant) to comply with the provisions of paragraph (g)(i) or (h) above. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Lender shall remain subject to the obligations under Section 2.18.

(j) Any Lender (or participant) claiming any indemnity payment or Additional Amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.16 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or document reasonably requested in writing by the relevant Borrower or to change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a filing or change would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such indemnity payment or Additional Amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the sole determination of such Lender (or participant), be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender (or participant).
(k) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agents for any Taxes (to the extent that the Company or any Borrowing Subsidiary has not already indemnified the Agents for such Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Company and any Borrowing Subsidiary to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by either Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.16(k) shall be paid within 10 days after an Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by such Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.
 
(l) Nothing contained in this Section 2.16 shall require any Lender (or participant) or any Administrative Agent to make available any of its tax returns (or any other information that it deems to be confidential or proprietary).
SECTION 2.17. . (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or otherwise) prior to 3:00 p.m., local time at the place of payment, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of CBNA, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to CBNA at its offices at 399 Park Avenue, New York, New York, or such other location as CBNA shall designate from time to time, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 8.5 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. CBNA shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars or, in the case of principal of and interest on any Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency, the applicable Alternative Currency, as the case may be. Except as provided in clause (c) below, each payment or prepayment of principal or payment of interest in respect of a Borrowing of Revolving Loans shall be allocated ratably among the parties entitled thereto.
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to CBNA to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant. Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
(d) Unless CBNA shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to CBNA for the account of the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make
 
such payment, CBNA may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to CBNA forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to CBNA, at the Overnight Rate in effect from time to time.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.6(b) or 2.17(d), then CBNA may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by CBNA for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.18. . (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to file any certificate or document requested by the Company (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions), to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such filing, designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then such Borrower may, upon notice to such Lender and CBNA, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 8.4), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (other than any outstanding Competitive Loans held by it and any and all rights and interests related thereto) to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) such Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agents which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans), accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or such Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments.

Upon proper notice and the receipt by CBNA of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement executed by such a Wholly Owned Subsidiary and the Company, such Wholly Owned Subsidiary shall be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement. A Subsidiary shall cease to be a Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder at such time as no Loans, fees or any other amounts due in connection therewith pursuant to the terms hereof shall be outstanding to such Subsidiary and such Subsidiary and the
Borrowing Subsidiaries
 
Company shall have executed and delivered to CBNA a Borrowing Subsidiary Termination; that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Borrowing Subsidiary shall cease to be a Borrowing Subsidiary solely because it no longer is a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company so long as such Borrowing Subsidiary and the Company shall not have executed and delivered to CBNA a Borrowing Subsidiary Termination and the Company's guarantee of the Borrowing Subsidiary Obligations of such Borrowing Subsidiary pursuant to Section 8.16 has not been released. Following the giving of any notice pursuant to this Section 2.19, if the designation of a Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary obligates the Administrative Agents or any Lender to comply with "know your customer" or similar identification procedures in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Company shall, promptly upon the request of an Administrative Agent or any Lender, supply such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by such Administrative Agent or such Lender in order for such Administrative Agent or such Lender to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with the results of all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations.
provided
If the Company shall designate as a Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder any Subsidiary not organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, any Lender unable to lend to such Borrowing Subsidiary due to applicable law or regulation may, with prior written notice to the Administrative Agents and the Company, fulfill its Commitment by causing an Affiliate of such Lender organized in the same jurisdiction as such Subsidiary or another foreign jurisdiction agreed to by such Lender and the Company, to act as the Lender in respect of such Borrowing Subsidiary, and such Lender shall, to the extent of Loans made to such Borrowing Subsidiary, be deemed for all purposes hereof to have satisfied its Commitment hereunder in respect of such Borrowing Subsidiary.
As soon as practicable after receiving notice from the Company or the Administrative Agents of the Company's intent to designate a Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary, and in any event no later than five Business Days after the delivery of such notice, for a Borrowing Subsidiary that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, any Lender that may not legally lend to, establish credit for the account of and/or do any business whatsoever with such Subsidiary directly or through an Affiliate of such Lender as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph (a "") shall so notify the Company and the Administrative Agents in writing. With respect to each Protesting Lender, the Company shall, effective on or before the date that such Borrowing Subsidiary shall have the right to borrow hereunder, either (A) notify the Administrative Agents and such Protesting Lender that the Commitment of such Protesting Lender shall be terminated and replaced with the Commitments of one or more other Lenders or assignees which agree to provide such replacement Commitments (in each case selected by the Company and approved by CBNA, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld); that such Protesting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee(s) (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company or the relevant Borrowing Subsidiary (in the case of all other amounts), or (B) cancel its request to designate such Subsidiary as a "Borrowing Subsidiary" hereunder.

Calculation Time
 
(b) If at the Calculation Time, the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure and the aggregate Competitive Loans exceeds the Commitment by 5% or more, then within five Business Days after notice thereof to the Borrower from CBNA, the Borrower shall prepay Revolving Loans (or cause any Borrowing Subsidiary to make such prepayment) in an aggregate principal amount at least equal to the lesser of (i) such excess and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans. Nothing set forth in this Section 2.20(b) shall be construed to require CBNA to calculate compliance under this Section 2.20(b) other than at the times set forth in Section 2.20(a).
SECTION 2.21. 
Defaulting Lenders
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(a); and
(b) the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 8.7); provided, that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender affected thereby.
No non-Defaulting Lender shall have any obligation to fund any portion of a Loan which a Defaulting Lender has failed to fund.

In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Citibank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is hereby appointed to act as an Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders and CBNA is hereby appointed to act as Advance Agent on behalf of the Lenders. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorizes each Administrative Agent (which term, for purposes of this Article VII, shall be deemed to include the Advance Agent) to take such actions on behalf of such Lender or holder and to exercise such powers as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agents or an Administrative Agent individually, as the case may be, by the terms and provisions hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. CBNA is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders, without hereby limiting any implied authority, (a) to receive on behalf of the Lenders all payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts due to the Lenders hereunder, and promptly to distribute to each Lender its proper share of each payment so received; (b) to give notice on behalf of each of the Lenders to the Company or any Borrowing Subsidiary of any Event of Default of which CBNA has actual knowledge acquired in connection with its agency hereunder; and (c) to distribute to each Lender copies of all notices, financial statements and other materials delivered by the Company or any Borrowing Subsidiary pursuant to this Agreement as received by CBNA. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Administrative Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against either Administrative Agent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, JPMCB shall have no duties under the Loan Documents in its capacity as Administrative Agent and none of the Documentation Agents, Joint Lead Arrangers or Bookrunners listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as an agent or a Lender.
Neither Administrative Agent nor any of their respective affiliates nor any of their or their respective affiliates' directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors or attorneys-in-fact shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them except for its or his or her own gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction), or be responsible for any statement, warranty or representation herein or in any document delivered in connection herewith or the contents of any document delivered in connection herewith, or be required to ascertain or to make any inquiry concerning the performance or observance by the Company or any Borrowing Subsidiary of any of the terms, conditions, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The Administrative Agents shall not be responsible to the Lenders for the due execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or effectiveness of this Agreement or other instruments or agreements or for the failure of the Company or any Borrowing Subsidiary to perform its
 
obligations under this Agreement. The Administrative Agents may deem and treat the Lender which makes any Loan as the holder of the indebtedness resulting therefrom for all purposes hereof until it shall have received notice from such Lender, given as provided herein, of the transfer thereof. The Administrative Agents shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or refraining from acting, in accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders and, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, such instructions and any action or inaction pursuant thereto shall be binding on all the Lenders. The Administrative Agents shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless they shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as they deem appropriate or they shall first be indemnified to their satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by them by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agents shall, in the absence of knowledge to the contrary, be entitled to rely on any instrument or document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons. Neither Administrative Agent nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents shall have any responsibility to the Company or any Borrowing Subsidiary on account of the failure of or delay in performance or breach by any Lender of any of its obligations hereunder or to any Lender on account of the failure of or delay in performance or breach by any other Lender or the Company of any of their respective obligations hereunder or in connection herewith. The Administrative Agents may execute any and all duties hereunder by or through their Affiliates, agents, attorneys-in-fact or employees and shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of legal counsel selected by them (including counsel to the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by them with respect to all matters arising hereunder and shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered in good faith by them in accordance with the advice of such counsel.
The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Administrative Agents shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by them pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement unless they shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders.
The Administrative Agents shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agents have received notice from a Lender or the Company referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Administrative Agents receive such a notice, the Administrative Agents shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agents shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders); provided that unless and until the Administrative Agents shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agents may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.
Subject, in the case of a resignation of both Administrative Agents, to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided below, either Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Company. Upon any such resignation of both Administrative Agents, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent acceptable to the Company. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agents give notice of their resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agents may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor bank, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agents and the retiring Administrative Agents shall be discharged from their duties and
 
obligations hereunder. If only one of the Administrative Agents shall resign, the other Administrative Agent shall become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 8.5 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
With respect to the Loans made by them hereunder, each Administrative Agent in its individual capacity and not as Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Administrative Agent, and such Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Administrative Agent.
Each Lender agrees (i) to reimburse the Administrative Agents, on demand, in the amount of its Applicable Percentage of any expenses incurred for the benefit of the Lenders by the Administrative Agents, including counsel fees and compensation of agents and employees paid for services rendered on behalf of the Lenders, which shall not have been reimbursed by the Company and (ii) to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agents and any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents, on demand, in the amount of such pro rata share, from and against any and all liabilities, taxes, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against either of them in its capacity as an Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by either of them under this Agreement to the extent the same shall not have been reimbursed by the Company; that no Lender shall be liable to any Administrative Agent for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Administrative Agent or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents as determined by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their respective affiliates or their or their respective affiliates' directors, officers, employees, advisors or attorneys-in-fact and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agents hereunder, the Administrative Agents shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Company or any Borrowing Subsidiary or any affiliate of the Company or any Borrowing Subsidiary that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agents or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, attorneys in fact or affiliates.

The Company further agrees that if payment in respect of any Borrowing Subsidiary Obligation shall be due in a currency other than Dollars and/or at a place of payment other than New York and if, by reason of any Change in Law, disruption of currency or foreign exchange markets, war or civil disturbance or similar event, payment of such Borrowing Subsidiary Obligation in such currency or such place of payment shall be impossible or, in the judgment of any applicable Lender, not consistent with the protection of its rights or interests, then, at the election of any applicable Lender, the Company shall make payment of such Borrowing Subsidiary Obligation in Dollars (based upon the applicable Exchange Rate in effect on the date of payment) and/or in New York, and shall indemnify such Lender against any losses or expenses that it shall sustain as a result of such alternative payment.
Upon payment by the Company of any Borrowing Subsidiary Obligations, each Lender shall, in a reasonable manner, assign the amount of the Borrowing Subsidiary Obligations owed to it and paid by the Company pursuant to this guarantee to the Company, such assignment to be to the extent to which the Borrowing Subsidiary Obligations in question were discharged by the Company, or make such disposition thereof as the Company shall direct (all without recourse to any Lender and without any representation or warranty by any Lender except with respect to the amount of the Borrowing Subsidiary Obligations so assigned).
pro
tanto
Upon payment by the Company of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Company against any Borrowing Subsidiary arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the Borrowing Subsidiary Obligations to the Lenders.

The Borrowers acknowledge and agree that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm's-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrowers, on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Borrower, its stockholders or its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise any Borrower, its stockholders or its Affiliates on other matters) and (y) each Lender is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of any Borrower, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Borrower acknowledges that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.
