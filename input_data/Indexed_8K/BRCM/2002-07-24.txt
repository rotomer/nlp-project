On July 18, 2002 Broadcom Corporation (Nasdaq: BRCM) reported financial results for the second fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2002. Net revenue for the second quarter of 2002 was $258.2 million, an increase of 8.1% over the $238.8 million reported for the first quarter of 2002 and an increase of 22.4% from the $210.9 million reported for the second quarter of 2001. Net loss for the second quarter of 2002 was $129.4 million, or $.49 per share (basic and diluted), compared with a net loss of $166.1 million, or $.63 per share (basic and diluted), for the first quarter of 2002, and a net loss of $436.4 million, or $1.73 per share (basic and diluted), for the second quarter of 2001. Net loss per share for the second quarter of 2002 was based on 265.4 million weighted average shares outstanding (basic and diluted), compared to 262.0 million weighted average shares outstanding (basic and diluted) in the first quarter of 2002 and 252.4 million weighted average shares outstanding (basic and diluted) in the second quarter of 2001.
Net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2002 was $497.0 million, a decrease of 4.7% over the $521.4 million reported in the six months ended June 30, 2001. Net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2002 was $295.5 million, or $1.12 per share (basic and diluted), compared with a net loss of $793.2 million, or $3.16 per share (basic and diluted), in the six months ended June 30, 2001.

Losses in the 2001 periods include charges for the amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets. Beginning with the first quarter of 2002, goodwill and intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, . Had this standard been in effect for the 2001 periods, the net loss for the second quarter of 2001 would have been $229.5 million, or $.91 per share (basic and diluted), and the net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2001 would have been $385.5 million, or $1.54 per share (basic and diluted).
