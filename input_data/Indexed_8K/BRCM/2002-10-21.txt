On October 17, 2002 Broadcom Corporation (Nasdaq: BRCM) reported financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2002. Net revenue for the third quarter of 2002 was $290.0 million, an increase of 12.3% over the $258.2 million reported for the second quarter of 2002 and an increase of 35.8% from the $213.6 million reported for the third quarter of 2001. Net loss for the third quarter of 2002 was $183.3 million, or $.68 per share (basic and diluted), compared with a net loss of $129.4 million, or $.49 per share (basic and diluted), for the second quarter of 2002, and a net loss of $1,619 million, or $6.36 per share (basic and diluted), for the third quarter of 2001. Net loss per share for the third quarter of 2002 was based on 270.1 million weighted average shares outstanding (basic and diluted), compared with 265.4 million weighted average shares outstanding (basic and diluted) for the second quarter of 2002 and 254.5 million weighted average shares outstanding (basic and diluted) for the third quarter of 2001.
Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 was $787.0 million, an increase of 7.1% over the $735.0 million reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2001. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 was $478.7 million, or $1.80 per share (basic and diluted), compared with a net loss of $2,412 million, or $9.57 per share (basic and diluted), for the nine months ended September 30, 2001. Net loss per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 was based on 265.8 million weighted average shares outstanding (basic and diluted), compared to 252.2 million weighted average shares outstanding (basic and diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2001.
Losses in the 2001 periods include charges for the amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets. Beginning with the first quarter of 2002, goodwill and intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Had this standard been in effect for the 2001 periods, the net loss for the third quarter of 2001 would have been $1,410 million, or $5.54 per share (basic and diluted), and the net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 would have been $1,795 million, or $7.12 per share (basic and diluted).
