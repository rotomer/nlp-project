Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
On July 15, 2004 in connection with its acquisition of Zyray Wireless Inc. ("Zyray"), Broadcom Corporation issued an aggregate of 1,894,221 shares of its Class A common stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Zyray capital stock. The offer and sale of the securities were effected without registration in reliance on the exemption afforded by Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The issuances were approved, after a hearing upon the fairness of the terms and conditions of the transaction, by the California Department of Corporations under authority to grant such approval as expressly authorized by the laws of the State of California. On September 17, 2004 Broadcom acquired Alphamosaic Limited ("Alphamosaic"). In connection with the acquisition, Broadcom issued or expects to issue an aggregate of 4,172,537 shares of its Class A common stock, and made cash payments aggregating approximately $2.7 million, in exchange for all outstanding shares of Alph amosaic capital stock and all shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding employee stock options of Alphamosaic. Of the 4,172,537 shares, 3,886,673 shares were issued at an initial closing on September 17, 2004 and the remaining 285,864 shares are anticipated to be issued at a second closing to occur on or about September 27, 2004. The offer and sale of the securities were effected without registration in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. Based upon the small number of holders of Alphamosaic capital stock receiving shares of Broadcom's Class A common stock in the initial closing, their financial position and sophistication and the absence of any general solicitation, the transaction was determined not to involve any public offering. Broadcom has also assumed obligations under a long term incentive plan that could result in the issuance of up to approximately 141,000 additional shares of Broadcom Class A common stock to Alphamosaic employees.< br> In the period from July 1, 2004 through September 17, 2004 Broadcom issued an aggregate of 1,420,961 shares of its Class A common stock upon conversion of a like number of shares of its Class B common stock. Broadcom has two classes of common stock outstanding, Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Each share of Broadcom's Class B common stock is convertible at the option of the holder into one share of Class A common stock, and in most instances will automatically convert into one share of Class A common stock upon sale or other transfer. The offer and sale of the securities were effected without registration in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act.
