Item 8.01. Other Events.
On September 30, 2004 Broadcom Corporation entered into a settlement and cross-license agreement with Agere Systems Inc. to settle all outstanding litigation between the two companies. Under the settlement, the companies agreed to dismiss all outstanding claims and counterclaims in the litigation with prejudice, and entered into reciprocal releases covering all asserted and unasserted patent-related claims against the other party and its affiliates. In addition, the agreement includes a cross-license under the respective patent portfolios of each party and its affiliates. Broadcom expects to record an aggregate of approximately $27.5 million in settlement costs incurred in connection with the foregoing settlement as well as the settlement of other outstanding claims and litigation during the three months ended September 30, 2004. - - - - - - - - - - - Separately, Broadcom's independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y"), has recently advised the Securities and Exchange Commission, the P ublic Company Accounting Oversight Board, and the Audit Committee of Broadcom's Board of Directors that certain non-audit work performed by E&Y's China affiliate has raised questions regarding E&Y's independence with respect to its performance of audit services. In the fourth quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, in connection with the performance of certain tax return preparation services for a subsidiary of Broadcom operating in China, E&Y's China affiliate held Broadcom tax funds totaling approximately $11,000 which it paid on behalf of Broadcom to the applicable Chinese tax authority. Such services were discontinued in February 2004. Broadcom paid approximately $900 in fees to E&Y's China affiliate in each of 2003 and 2004 for the tax return preparation services. Broadcom's Audit Committee and E&Y have discussed E&Y's independence with respect to Broadcom in light of the foregoing facts. E&Y has informed the Audit Committee that it does not believe that the holding and paying of these funds impaired E&Y's independence with respect to Broadcom. Broadcom is unaware, and E&Y has informed the Audit Committee that it is unaware, of any similar instance in which E&Y has held custody of Broadcom funds in a manner raising questions regarding E&Y's independence.
