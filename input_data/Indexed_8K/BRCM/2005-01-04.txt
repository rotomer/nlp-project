Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 29, 2004 Broadcom Corporation entered into a lease agreement (the "Lease") with Irvine Commercial Property Company (the "Landlord"). Under the terms of the Lease, Broadcoms headquarters will move from its present location in Irvine, California to a larger facility in Irvine eventually consisting of eight buildings with an aggregate of approximately 685,000 square feet. The new facility will be constructed in the University Research Park adjacent to the University of California, Irvine campus. The Lease is for a period of ten years and two months beginning after the completion of the first two buildings and related tenant improvements, which is anticipated to be in the first calendar quarter of 2007. The aggregate rent for the term of the Lease is approximately $183 million. In addition to rent, the Lease requires Broadcom to pay certain taxes, insurance and operating costs relating to the leased buildings, in amounts yet to be determined. Broadcom is also responsible for the costs of certain tenant improvements associated with the new facility but will be entitled to reimbursement for certain costs from the Landlord. Among other items, the Lease also provides for renewal options at then prevailing market rents and certain rights to lease additional space in the University Research Park.
