EXHIBIT 10.1
The Compensation Committee did not establish the base salary of Scott A. McGregor, the Chief Executive Officer of the company, on February 1, 2005 because the 2005 base salary of Mr. McGregor was established when he joined Broadcom in January 2005. Since Mr. McGregor was not employed by Broadcom during 2004, he did not receive a 2004 bonus.
