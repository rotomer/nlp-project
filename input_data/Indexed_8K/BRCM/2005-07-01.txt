Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Broadcom Corporation entered into a Sixth Amendment to its Product Purchase Agreement (the "Amendment") with General Instrument Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Motorola, Inc., as of June 30, 2005. Motorola is a significant customer of Broadcom; sales to Motorola, including sales to its manufacturing subcontractors, accounted for 12.4% of Broadcoms total net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2004. The Amendment modifies the initial agreement between Broadcom and General Instrument, which was entered into in September 1997 and covers the development and supply of chips for General Instruments digital cable set-top boxes and cable modems, to extend General Instruments minimum purchase requirements of chips for cable set-top boxes for an additional six months.
