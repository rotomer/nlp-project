Item 8.01 Other Events.
On March 28, 2006 a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Orange, by a plaintiff who claims to be a shareholder of Broadcom. The lawsuit, entitled Jin v. Broadcom Corporation et al. (Case No. 06 CC00057), names as defendants the company, each of the members of its Board of Directors, and Henry T. Nicholas III, the company's co-founder. The principal claims asserted in the lawsuit are that: (a) disclosures in the company's March 27, 2006 proxy statement concerning proposed Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, which would, among other things, increase the number of authorized shares of its Class A common stock, are incorrect and/or misleading; and (b) Broadcoms recent stock split, the recent amendment to its share repurchase program, and recent and proposed changes in the compensation of its non-employee directors constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. Plaintiff contends, among other things, that the proposed increase in the number o f authorized Class A shares is part of an alleged scheme to allow company insiders to sell Class B stock and nevertheless retain voting control over the company's affairs. Plaintiff has indicated that she intends to seek expedited discovery and to pursue preliminary injunctive relief concerning the shareholder vote on the Restated Articles and the company's implementation of the share repurchase program. The company believes that the claims asserted in the lawsuit are entirely without merit and intends to defend them vigorously.
