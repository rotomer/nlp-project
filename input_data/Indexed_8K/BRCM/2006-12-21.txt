Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) As previously announced, on September 19, 2006 William J. Ruehle resigned as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom Corporation. On December 17, 2006 Broadcom entered into an agreement with Mr. Ruehle related to his outstanding options to purchase shares of Broadcoms Class A and Class B common stock (the "Agreement"). Pursuant to the Agreement, the exercise prices per share for options to purchase a total of 1,335,000 shares of Broadcoms Class A common stock, with grant dates of November 3, 1998 and August 5, 2002 (the "Repriced Options"), were increased to avoid any adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, pursuant to the Agreement all of Mr. Ruehles outstanding options to purchase shares of Broadcoms Class A common stock granted after Broadcom's initial public offering in April 1998, including the Repriced Options, have been cancelled without any payment by Broadcom. Specifically, options to purchase a total of 1,846,092 shares of Broadcoms Class A common stock, with grant dates of November 3, 1998, December 24, 2001, August 5, 2002, November 10, 2003, December 7, 2003, February 5, 2005 and May 5, 2006, have been cancelled by Broadcom and ceased to be outstanding on December 19, 2006. The total value of the options cancelled, based on the difference between their original exercise prices per share and $33.59 (the closing price per share of Broadcom Class A common stock on December 15, 2006), was $32,765,808. Also pursuant to the Agreement, Broadcom made a payment to Mr. Ruehle in exchange for and in full satisfaction of his outstanding vested options to purchase 300,000 shares of Broadcoms Class B common stock that were granted prior to Broadcom's initial public offering. The total amount paid was $5,195,517, which is the difference between $1.6667 (the option exercise price per share) and $33.59 (the closing price per share of Broadcom Class A common stock on December 15 , 2006) for each of the shares of Broadcom Class B common stock underlying the options, less the required withholding taxes of $4,381,473. The Agreement provides that, in the event that Broadcom asserts any claim against Mr. Ruehle, including claims presently asserted in the pending shareholder derivative litigations (the "Claims"), Mr. Ruehle will be entitled to a credit equal to the value of the options cancelled pursuant to the Agreement without consideration (the "Credit"), unless otherwise ordered or disapproved by a court, and subject to certain express conditions. The Credit, if issued, will be calculated as the product of the total number of shares of Broadcom Class A common stock underlying the options cancelled without consideration and the difference between the exercise prices of the options cancelled, as amended under the Agreement, and $33.59 (the closing price per share of Broadcom Class A common stock on December 15, 2006). Mr. Ruehle has a right to receive the Credit only in the f orm of an offset against any damages or monetary relief that may be awarded to Broadcom in connection with the Claims, or pursuant to any future settlement of the Claims, and subject to the condition that Mr. Ruehle pay to Broadcom in cash the amount of all applicable federal, state and other withholding taxes due with respect to the issuance of the Credit. Finally, under the Agreement, Broadcom is not obligated, and Mr. Ruehle may make no claim against Broadcom, for any liability Mr. Ruehle may incur pursuant to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The parties agreed that Mr. Ruehle will not receive any assistance from Broadcom or otherwise be made whole to offset the Section 409A or other tax consequences that may arise from the cancellation or termination of his outstanding options or from the payment made to Mr. Ruehle pursuant to the Agreement.
