(e) On December 20, 2006 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Broadcom Corporation adopted a supplemental bonus program from which cash bonuses may be paid to individuals, other than executive officers as defined under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, who are currently eligible to participate in Broadcom's 2006 Performance Bonus Plan, adopted in April 2006 (the "2006 Plan"). As a result of the adoption of the supplemental bonus program, there will be a total combined bonus pool of up to $11.25 million available to award to participating employees under the 2006 Plan (including the executive officers) and those eligible for participation under the supplemental bonus program. Individual awards from the supplemental bonus program will be approved by the Compensation Committee.
