Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) On February 5, 2007 the Board of Directors of Broadcom Corporation approved special payments to certain members of its Audit Committee. These payments were proposed and approved in light of the extraordinary amount of time and effort expended by such individuals in connection with Broadcom's voluntary review of its equity award practices, as well as the restatement of its financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and prior periods included in amended reports filed with the Commission on January 23, 2007.
During the course of the review, conducted over an eight-month period, the four directors held more than 30 formal meetings and participated in numerous additional working sessions and informal telephonic and face-to-face meetings. They were also responsible for supervising and reviewing the work of the company's outside legal counsel in the portion of the review related to determining appropriate measurement dates for the company's equity awards and the work of independent legal counsel in the portion of the review related to the conduct and performance of Broadcom's officers, employees and directors who were involved in the stock option granting process. The latter counsel reviewed more than six million pages of documents and electronic information and interviewed more than forty individuals, some more than once.
The following table sets forth the amount of the special payment to be received by each of the affected directors:
