Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
The information in this Current Report, including the accompanying exhibit, is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section. The information in this Current Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, regardless of any general incorporation language contained in such filing.
On July 19, 2007 Broadcom Corporation issued a press release announcing unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our GAAP results, Broadcom reports adjusted net income and net income per share, referred to respectively as "non-GAAP net income" and "non-GAAP net income per share." Non-GAAP net income consists of net income excluding stock-based compensation expense, as well as charges related to acquisitions and other charges and gains that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to our core operating performance. Non-GAAP net income per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income by adjusted GAAP weighted average shares outstanding (diluted). For purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income per share, the calculation of GAAP weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) is adjusted to exclude the benefits of compensation costs attributable to future services and not yet recognized in the financial statements that are treated as proceeds assumed to be used to repurchase shares under the GAAP treasury stock method.
Broadcom believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial reports, and also facilitates comparisons with other companies in our industry, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results. Management has historically used non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides an additional measure of our core operating results and facilitates comparisons of our core operating performance against prior periods and our business model objectives. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate our ongoing core operations. Externally, we believe that non-GAAP net income continues to be useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of our company.
Internally, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are significant measures used by management for purposes of:

Non-GAAP net income reflects net income adjusted for the following items:
The calculation of non-GAAP net income per share is adjusted for the following item:
Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Broadcom's results as reported under GAAP. Broadcom expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from our non-GAAP net income should not be construed as an inference

that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Some of the limitations in relying on non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are:

"In the midst of continued variability in the ordering patterns of a few of our larger customers, we are pleased to announce that revenue in the second quarter was in line with our guidance," said Scott A. McGregor, Broadcom's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Broadcom had another strong quarter of cash generated from operations and continued to put our cash to work aggressively, buying back shares and acquiring companies to help drive our future growth. We believe the increasing diversity of our customer base and end-market exposure  along with significant new product momentum  should enable Broadcom to increase revenue sequentially in the third quarter."
