Item 8.01 Other Events.
On August 8, 2007 David A. Dull, the Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Broadcom Corporation, received a "Wells Notice" from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in connection with the SECs ongoing investigation of the companys historical option granting practices. As previously announced, Broadcom and its Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Technical Officer received similar Wells Notices in July 2007. The Wells Notices provide notification that the staff of the SEC intends to recommend to the Commission that it bring a civil action against the recipients for possible violations of the securities laws. Based on discussions with the SEC staff, Broadcom believes that the issues the staff intends to pursue relate to the companys historical option granting processes and the accounting relating to those option grants. Under the process established by the SEC, recipients have the opportunity to respond in writing to a Wells Notice before the SEC staff make s any formal recommendation to the Commission regarding what action, if any, should be brought by the SEC. The Company and the individual recipients intend to provide written submissions to the SEC in response to the Wells Notices.
