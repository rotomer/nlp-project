(e) As previously reported, on May 2, 2007 the Board of Directors of Broadcom Corporation appointed a Special Litigation Committee composed of disinterested independent directors to evaluate the claims made in certain shareholder derivative actions, to assess whether the continuation of those actions or pursuit of those claims by or on behalf of Broadcom is in the company's best interests, and, to the extent the Special Litigation Committee decides that pursuing any of those claims is in Broadcom's best interests, to make any and all decisions on behalf of the company regarding the litigation, settlement, or other disposition of such claims.
On February 7, 2008 the Board of Directors approved a compensation arrangement for the members of its Special Litigation Committee. Each Committee member will receive $15,000 in cash compensation per quarter, and the Chair of the Committee will receive an additional $5,000 in cash compensation per quarter. The compensation arrangement was approved in recognition of the substantial amount of time each individual is dedicating to activities of the Committee.
Special one time payments at the above rates will be made as soon as practicable to compensate Committee members for their past services, measured from July 1, 2007. The following table sets forth the amount of the special payment to be received by each of the affected directors. Future payments will be made quarterly in arrears, and prorated as appropriate based upon service for partial quarters.
