Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
In November 2008 Broadcom Corporation entered into an agreement (the "Lease Amendment") with The Irvine Company LLC to occupy an additional 53,840 square feet of office space in an existing building located adjacent to its corporate headquarters beginning on or about January 1, 2010. The company entered into the Lease Amendment to accommodate future growth and allow it to obtain cost savings from shared infrastructure and support costs afforded by leasing contiguous space. The total additional lease cost will be $10.72 million to be paid beginning in 2010 over the remaining term of the lease, which expires in April 2017. Except as set forth in the Lease Amendment, the provisions of the original lease, including the term of the lease, remain unchanged.
