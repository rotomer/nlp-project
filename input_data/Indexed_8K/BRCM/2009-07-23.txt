'467 Litigation
1958 Litigation
     B. The Parties desire to grant certain rights to one another with respect to certain of their respective patents and patent applications, and Broadcom is willing to assign certain patents and patent applications to Qualcomm, for the consideration and on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Therefore, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:
1.
Headings and Definitions
All headings used in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and are not intended to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any clause. Appendix 1 contains definitions of capitalized terms used in this Agreement.
2.
Term
This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date and will continue in full force and effect until every Patent has expired or been ruled, in a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction, to be completely (i.e., all claims of such Patent are) invalid.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain sections of, or rights or obligations set forth in, this Agreement may be terminated as set forth in Section 13 (Termination).
3.
Payment
     . Subject to Section 3.3, Qualcomm shall make, or cause to be made on behalf of Qualcomm by a Qualcomm Subsidiary, non-refundable payments to Broadcom totaling eight hundred ninety-one million, two hundred thousand U.S. dollars (US$891,200,000) as follows:
3.1 Payments by Qualcomm to Broadcom
Each payment will be made in U.S. dollars and by means of a wire transfer to the account designated by Broadcom in , provided that Broadcom may update such account information for a particular payment upon written notice delivered to Qualcomm at least ten (10) Business Days before the due date of such payment.
Attachment H
     . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Broadcom will have the right to retain all payments received by Broadcom from Qualcomm prior to February 20, 2009 (without any offset or credit by Qualcomm) relating to the U.S. Litigation (as defined in Section 4.1(a)), including all payments of royalties, damages, and costs. However, the payments described in Section 3.1 are in lieu of, and Broadcom hereby waives and releases any and all rights to receive, any payments that would have otherwise become payable by Qualcomm on or after February 20, 2009 (including any payment obligations that may have accrued before February 20, 2009 but are not payable until on or after February 20, 2009) relating to the U.S. Litigation. For avoidance of doubt, Broadcom hereby waives and releases any and all rights to receive any payments for the amounts in the bonds, escrows, and letters of credit Qualcomm has posted in the '467 Litigation.
3.2 Payments Relating to U.S. Litigation
     
3.3 Deductions
          . If permitted by [**] to do so, Broadcom shall promptly notify Qualcomm in writing if, in connection with the [**] by [**] in order to obtain rights under the [**] by and between Broadcom and [**] (the "[**] ") to any of Broadcom's patents for [**] or an Affiliate of [**] pays any amounts to Broadcom (or any of Broadcom's Subsidiaries) after the Effective Date under the [**] Agreement or any amendment thereto or replacement thereof. Such notice must specify the exact amounts that [**] or an Affiliate of [**] paid to Broadcom and its Subsidiaries (the "[**] "). Broadcom represents and warrants that, as of the Effective Date, it has not received any payment from [**]
(a) Payments by [**]
Agreement
Payment
 
that, had it been received after the Effective Date, would have been the [**] Payment. If [**] requests reimbursement and Qualcomm reimburses [**] or an Affiliate of [**] for all or any portion of the [**] Payment (whether or not Broadcom has notified Qualcomm of such [**] Payment), and Qualcomm provides Broadcom with written notice of [**] request for such reimbursement (if permitted by [**] to do so) and written proof of such payment by Qualcomm within thirty (30) days after such payment, then Qualcomm will be entitled to deduct such reimbursed amounts in full from the next payment (or payments if the reimbursed amount exceeds the amount of the next payment) owed to Broadcom under Section 3.1 after Qualcomm has provided such proof of payment and, solely if permitted by [**] to do so, such notice.
     . Amounts payable by one Party to the other Party under this Agreement are payable in full to such other Party without deduction of, or reduction for, any taxes, duties, or imposts. If a Party is legally required to make any such withholding or deduction from any payment due to the other Party under this Agreement, the sum payable by such Party upon which such withholding or deduction is based shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after such withholding or deduction, the other Party receives a net amount equal to the amount the other Party would have received in the absence of such required withholding or deduction. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, neither Party will be required to make additional payments under this Section 3.4 with respect to any amounts payable under this Agreement to a receiving Party if such receiving Party is not a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, so long as the paying Party (a) cooperates with the receiving Party and takes any reasonable steps requested by the receiving Party to minimize or eliminate any such withholding taxes (including by committing to a specific entity as the paying entity) and (b) provides tax receipts evidencing the payments of any such withholding taxes. Each receiving Party further agrees to provide an IRS Form W-9 or an IRS Form W-8BEN, as applicable, to the appropriate paying Party. Each Party will be solely responsible for reporting and paying all taxes of any nature imposed by any Governmental Authority in any jurisdiction on such Party (or any of its Subsidiaries) as a result of the payments or transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.1 U.S. Litigation
          The Parties shall promptly seek the dismissal, with prejudice, of all suits, actions, appeals, and other legal proceedings that are pending between them in any federal, state, local, or other court, tribunal, or administrative agency in the United States (collectively, the ""). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement (and in no event later than ten (10) days after the Effective Date), the Parties shall execute and file with each of the relevant courts, tribunals, or agencies any forms or pleadings necessary to dismiss with prejudice all U.S. Litigation. Forms and pleadings acceptable to both Parties for such dismissal are attached hereto as ; if the relevant court, tribunal, or agency requests or requires the Parties to modify such forms and pleadings, the Parties shall make such modifications. Each Party shall take all actions reasonably required in connection with the dismissal with prejudice of all U.S. Litigation promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each Party agrees that it will not (and it will ensure that each of its Subsidiaries does not) cite or refer to any orders, rulings, judgments, or opinions arising from the U.S. Litigation, or any factual descriptions of the other Party's
(a)
U.S. Litigation
Attachment D
 
conduct that such Party alleged to be wrongful in such Litigation (""), for any reason in any future Litigation in which the other Party (or any of its Subsidiaries) is a party, except solely (i) for citing or referring to legal principles or holdings directly relevant to the issues in such future Litigation and factual information directly relevant to the applicability of such legal principles or holdings in such future Litigation; or (ii) to the extent reasonably required to fully and properly respond to information requests from Governmental Authorities, valid subpoenas and as otherwise required by law. In no event shall a Party (or any of its Subsidiaries) cite or refer to Previously Alleged Conduct as evidence of intent, "pattern or practice", or "unclean hands".
Previously Alleged Conduct
          Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement by both Parties (and in no event later than ten (10) days after the Effective Date), the Parties shall sign and submit a joint motion to vacate the injunction and contempt rulings issued in the '467 Litigation; however, Broadcom will have the right to retain all amounts paid to Broadcom in connection therewith prior to February 20, 2009. Each Party shall cooperate in taking any further steps that may be reasonably necessary to cause such motion to be granted. The Parties shall also agree to a joint stipulation and stipulated order (in the form attached hereto as ) reciting that this Agreement fully settles all claims arising from the patents-in-suit in the '467 Litigation as well as all disputes arising from the injunction, vacating all damage awards and sanctions and attorneys' fees unpaid as of February 20, 2009, and canceling all bonds, escrow agreements, and letters of credit; however, Broadcom will have the right to retain all amounts paid to Broadcom in connection therewith prior to February 20, 2009.
(b)
Attachment E
          Notwithstanding the releases in Section 5 or anything else to the contrary herein, all protective orders issued in connection with the past and pending (as of the Effective Date) Litigation will remain in full force and effect. Promptly after the Effective Date, the Parties shall, and shall direct that all consultants, experts, counsel, and other persons acting on their behalf at any time during the pendency of such Litigation, return or destroy, no later than sixty (60) days after the Effective Date, all items containing information of the other Party provided during such Litigation and designated as confidential or protected under any protective order in such Litigation (""). In addition, each Party shall immediately cease using all devices, including prototypes, handsets, SURFs, and FFAs, provided by a Party to the other Party under any protective order in such Litigation and all such devices shall be returned to the producing Party within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date. For avoidance of doubt, the obligation to destroy all Protected Information extends to all items containing Protected Information, including all work product, pleadings, motion papers, legal memoranda, correspondence, emails, reports, declarations, transcripts, exhibits, and all copies thereof, with the exception of copies stored on back-up tapes or other disaster recovery media, in each case only to the extent of the Protected Information contained therein (and for the avoidance of doubt, redaction of the Protected Information from such items shall be deemed to satisfy such destruction requirement). With respect to Protected Information remaining in back-up tapes and other disaster storage media, neither Party nor its consultants, experts, counsel or other party acting on its behalf shall make copies of any such Protected Information available to any person for any purpose other than backup or disaster recovery unless compelled by law and, in that event, only after thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other Party or such shorter period as required by court order, subpoena, or applicable law. Within sixty (60) days after the Effective Date, each Party shall provide a statement in writing, and direct its consultants, experts, counsel
(c)
Protected Information
 
and other persons acting on their behalf to provide a statement in writing (provided that a single statement will suffice for each law firm or other organization with which such persons are associated), stating that they have complied with this Section 4.1(c). It is agreed that neither Party shall be liable for the failure by its consultants, experts, counsel or other party acting on its behalf to comply with such Party's direction to return or destroy the other Party's Protected Information. Qualcomm agrees that it will share in the reimbursement of reasonable costs incurred by Broadcom's outside counsel to destroy Qualcomm Protected Information, as follows: Broadcom shall pay [**] of such costs, after which Qualcomm shall pay the next [**] of such costs; thereafter, each Party will bear [**] of additional costs incurred, except that Broadcom's total responsibility for such costs will not exceed [**]; and if the total costs exceed [**], Qualcomm will bear all such costs in excess of [**], provided that at Qualcomm's written request, Broadcom will direct its counsel to cease further efforts to return or destroy Qualcomm Protected Information. Broadcom will direct its outside counsel to provide Qualcomm with information (not including attorney-client information) every fifteen (15) days, that summarizes all costs incurred and for which reimbursement is sought during the preceding fifteen (15) days. In the event of any conflict between the protective orders in the past and pending (as of the Effective Date) Litigation and the terms of this Section 4.1(c), as between the Parties (but without changing any requirements applicable to any Third Parties), the terms of this Section 4.1(c) will apply. If necessary to resolve any conflict between this Section 4.1(c) and protective orders in cases not referenced in , the Parties agree to petition the relevant courts or agencies to amend such orders accordingly.
Attachment D
          Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement by both Parties (and in no event later than ten (10) days after the Effective Date), Broadcom shall submit a request for leave to withdraw from all further involvement in the 1958 Litigation in the following form: "In light of a global settlement of litigation reached between the parties, and in the interests of facilitating the development of healthy business relations between the parties on an ongoing basis, Broadcom respectfully requests leave to withdraw from further participation in these proceedings".
(d)
     
4.2 Competition Law Complaints and Proceedings
          Promptly after the execution and delivery of this Agreement (and in no event later than ten (10) days after the Effective Date), each Party shall send a letter to each antitrust, competition law, or similar Governmental Authority anywhere in the world with whom such Party has filed an antitrust or competition law complaint against the other Party, including the complaints Broadcom has filed with the European Commission and the Korea Fair Trade Commission (""), informing the Governmental Authority that the Parties have resolved their disputes with respect to the complaint, requesting that such Party's complaint be withdrawn as permitted under applicable law, and informing the Governmental Authority that as a result such Party is no longer a party to any such continuing proceeding or investigation. Each Party shall promptly provide the other Party with a complete and accurate copy of each such letter. If Broadcom fails to send such a letter to the European Commission or the KFTC within ten (10) days after the Effective Date, Qualcomm may disclose the contents of this Section 4.2(a) to the European Commission or the KFTC, as the case may be. In the event that a Governmental Authority with whom a Party has filed an antitrust or competition law complaint requires
(a)
KFTC
 
additional procedures to withdraw such complaint, such Party will promptly follow such additional procedures as required by such Government Authority to withdraw the complaint.
          The Parties hereby stipulate that the terms of this Agreement, and the consideration exchanged under this Agreement, constitute a full settlement of claims asserted by each Party including claims that each Party has made, or could have made, with respect to any of the other Party's practices (including the terms and conditions of the other Party's sales or license agreements) that such Party has previously alleged or could have alleged were unfair, anticompetitive, or in violation of any laws or regulations, including antitrust or competition laws or regulations, or in violation of any obligations arising from participation in, or violation of any rules relevant to, any standards-setting organizations, including ARIB, ETSI, IEEE, JVT, and TIA.
(b)
          Each Party shall not make (and shall ensure that none of its Subsidiaries makes, and shall not authorize or direct any of its or its Subsidiaries' attorneys, agents, or representatives to make on its or its Subsidiaries' behalf) any formal or informal statement or representation to the European Commission, the KFTC, or any court or other Governmental Authority responsible for antitrust or competition law matters, that is inconsistent with the stipulation set forth in Section 4.2(b) above. Each Party agrees that it shall not (and shall ensure that each of its Subsidiaries does not) assert any claim or complaint against the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or Support any Third Party in asserting any claim or complaint against the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries, in Litigation to the extent based in whole or in part on (i) allegations that are inconsistent with the stipulations set forth in Section 4.2(b) above, or (ii) any alleged violations by the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries of any antitrust, competition law, or similar laws or regulations, or of any patent licensing obligations arising from participation in, or rules of, standards-setting organizations including ARIB, ETSI, IEEE, JVT, and TIA, to the extent that such alleged violations arise from any conduct or practices for (a) the licensing of its patents engaged in before the Effective Date, including the terms and conditions of Qualcomm's existing patent license agreements for products, components, or equipment that implement WWAN Interfaces and/or the MediaFLO Broadcast Standards (the "") or (b) the sale of its products or services or licensing of software products that the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries engaged in before the Effective Date as reflected in the other Party's agreements entered into prior to the Effective Date relating to the sales or licensing of its products or services (the "") (the Existing Licensing Practices and the Existing Sales Practices are collectively referred to as the ""). Furthermore, to the extent that a Party or its Subsidiaries engage, at any time after the Effective Date, in the same or substantially the same patent licensing conduct or patent licensing practices as the Existing Licensing Practices such Party or its Subsidiaries generally engaged in as of the Effective Date, such future patent licensing conduct or patent licensing practices will also be considered Conduct/Practices (including, with respect to Qualcomm, entering into new agreements or amendments to existing agreements (e.g., to license additional patents, standards, or products) that contain the same or substantially similar terms and conditions as Qualcomm's existing forms of WWAN and MediaFLO patent license agreements), and the other Party agrees that it shall not (and shall ensure that each of its Subsidiaries does not) assert any claim or complaint alleging violations of antitrust, competition law, or similar laws or regulations, or of any patent licensing obligations of standards-setting organizations, against the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or Support any Third Party in
(c)
Existing Licensing Practices
Existing Sales Practices
Conduct/Practices
 
asserting any such claim or complaint against the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries, in Litigation to the extent based in whole or in part on such future patent licensing conduct or patent licensing practices. However, the foregoing shall not be construed as restricting either Party from pursuing claims against the other Party for future violations by the other Party of laws, regulations, obligations, or rules of standards-setting organizations including ARIB, ETSI, IEEE, JVT, and TIA that do not arise from such Conduct/Practices (for example, without limitation, a claim could be made based on the failure of a Party after the Effective Date to make required disclosures to standards-setting organizations of Essential Patent Claims in connection with proposals for new or revised standards) or for conduct or practices that are different from the Conduct/Practices. In addition, to the extent that a Party or its Subsidiaries, during a period of four (4) years after the Effective Date, engages in the same or substantially the same conduct or practices as the Existing Sales Practices, then the other Party agrees that it shall not (and shall ensure that each of its Subsidiaries does not) assert any claim or complaint alleging that such conduct or practices conducted during such four (4) year period is a violation of antitrust, competition law, or similar laws or regulations against the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or Support any Third Party in asserting any such claim or complaint against the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries, in Litigation. Nothing in this Section 4.2(c) shall preclude or restrict either Party from (1) fully and properly responding to information requests from Governmental Authorities, valid subpoenas and as otherwise required by law; or (2) complying with existing obligations under agreements with Third Parties to pay or contribute to costs for joint activities undertaken prior to the Effective Date expected to be paid within ninety (90) days after the Effective Date (subject to resolving any disputes with regard to amounts that may be charged).
          Notwithstanding the foregoing or the release granted by each Party in Section 5, if a Governmental Authority orders or otherwise requires a Party (and such order becomes final and binding following all available avenues of review or appeal or otherwise goes into effect), or the Government Authority and such Party enter into a settlement, consent decree, or similar agreement (in this paragraph, such order, requirement, settlement, consent decree, or agreement will be referred to as an "order"), to change its sales or licensing terms, conditions, prices, or practices in a manner that applies to all suppliers of Components (or other class or type of Persons that includes the other Party) based on findings that such Party ("") has violated (i) antitrust, competition, or similar laws or regulations or (ii) obligations arising from participation in, or rules relevant to, any standards-setting organization, then the other Party will not be precluded from entitlement to any benefits of such order by virtue of this Agreement (other than any monetary payments from such Party to such other Party, which such other Party would not be entitled to seek). However, this paragraph shall not be construed as conferring on such other Party any private right of action against the Subject Party based on any such findings, and to the extent that such other Party may have otherwise had any such private right of action, such other Party agrees that such private right of action is released under Section 5. However, the preceding sentence does not preclude such other Party from pursuing any private right of action against the Subject Party (and Section 5 does not release the Subject Party from any claim or liability) with respect to any failure by the Subject Party to comply with any such order of a Governmental Authority to change its sales or licensing terms, conditions, prices, or practices, to the extent impacting the other Party.
(d)
Subject Party
     . At any time after the Effective Date, neither Party shall participate in, and within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date each Party shall withdraw from, any
4.3 Oppositions
 
interference, re-examination, opposition, or other proceeding, in each case that is currently pending, in which ownership, validity, scope, priority date, and/or enforceability of a patent or patent application of the other Party is being challenged; however, such withdrawal will not limit the Party's ability to challenge the validity of the patent later, if such patent is Asserted against such Party.

               (ii) If the Parties are unable to agree on a substitute provision for such jurisdiction within the later of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the Final Judgment or sixty (60) days after the conclusion of all appeals of the Final Judgment (if any), then either Party may submit the matter to arbitration pursuant to Section 16.4, except that the Parties will engage in "baseball" arbitration whereby each Party will submit its proposed substitute provision to the arbitrator and the arbitrator will be instructed to select the proposed substitute provision that, in the arbitrator's judgment, most closely effectuates, to the maximum extent possible, both Parties' intent reflected in Section 7.9(a) and the intent of the original provision that was adjudicated to exhaust a Party's patents or otherwise provide Pass-Through Rights to a Third Party or to be invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable. Before each Party submits its final proposed substitute provision to the arbitrator, the other Party will have the opportunity to review and provide suggested revisions to the first Party's proposed substitute provision, which the first Party may incorporate or reject, in whole or in part, in its discretion. Neither Party will disclose to the arbitrator its suggested revisions to the other Party's proposed substitute provision. Each Party's final proposed provision (for purposes of the arbitration) will be the same as a provision that such Party has previously proposed to the other Party, except that such Party may adopt one or more revisions suggested by the other Party to more closely achieve the intent of the original provision and Section 7.9(a). Each Party agrees that it will not take the position in any such arbitration that there should be no substitute provision in the Agreement. During the pendency of the arbitration (if a substitute provision for Section 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 7.1(c), 7.2(c), 7.8, and/or 7.9(b)(iii) is in question), [**]. If the substitute provision selected by the arbitrator is subsequently adjudicated in a Final Judgment in any jurisdiction to exhaust a Party's Patents or otherwise provide Pass-Through Rights to a Third Party or to be invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the provisions of this Section 7.9(b) will again apply, with the entire process repeated from the beginning (commencing with negotiations under Section 7.9(b)(i)) in order to determine a new substitute provision.
               (iii) If any substitute provision allows either Party (or any of its Subsidiaries) to Assert against the other Party (or any of the other Party's Subsidiaries or any of its or their Contractors or Distributors) any infringement claim that could not have been Asserted against the other Party (or any of the other Party's Subsidiaries or any of its or their Contractors or Distributors) under the original version of Section 6.1, 6.2, or 6.3, as applicable and as originally intended by the Parties (a ""), then before [**] the other Party (or any of the other Party's Subsidiaries or any of its or their Contractors or Distributors), the first Party and its Subsidiaries shall [**]. Any applicable statute of limitations for a Precluded Claim will be tolled during any time that an action against a Broadcom customer is pending. If, at any
Precluded Claim
 
time, the first Party ("") or any of its Subsidiaries does Assert any Precluded Claim against the other Party (or any of the other Party's Subsidiaries) (""), then the Defending Party will have the right in its sole discretion, upon written notice to the Asserting Party, to [**] the other Party and its Subsidiaries, and their respective Contractors and Distributors [**]; (b) all [**] the other Party and its Subsidiaries, Contractors, and Distributors pursuant to [**]; (c) the [**] Asserting Party's and its Subsidiaries' direct or indirect customers under [**]; (d) if Broadcom is the Defending Party, [**]; and (e) all of the Defending Party's obligations and the Asserting Party's and its Subsidiaries' and customer's rights under [**]. If any of the foregoing options in this paragraph (iii) is (alone or along with other provisions in this Agreement or other options in this paragraph (iii)) adjudicated in a final judgment in any jurisdiction, in any Litigation to which a Party or one of its Subsidiaries is a party and that specifically addresses this Section 7.9(b)(iii) in this Agreement, to exhaust a Party's Patents or otherwise provide Pass-Through Rights to a Third Party for Non-Exhaustive Products, then a replacement provision for such jurisdiction will be substituted that does not cause the adjudicated exhaustion or Pass-Through Rights, but otherwise preserves the rights of the Defending Party to the maximum extent possible; the process set forth in Sections 7.9(b)(i) and 7.9(b)(ii) will be used to determine the replacement provision for such jurisdiction.
Asserting Party
Defending Party
               (iv) Neither Party or any of its Subsidiaries will claim or assert, in any Litigation (regardless of whether or not the other Party is a party to such Litigation) that [**] exhausts a Party's Patents or otherwise provide Pass-Through Rights to a Third Party for Non-Exhaustive Products. In addition to the rights under Section 7.9(b)(iii) or any replacement provision, a Defending Party against whom (or against whose Subsidiary, Contractor, or Distributor) a Precluded Claim has been Asserted will have the right in its sole discretion, upon written notice to the Asserting Party, to [**]. If the Asserting Party withdraws the Assertion of the Precluded Claim and reimburses all of the Defending Party's costs and expenses in connection with such Assertion within thirty (30) days after the notice from the Defending Party, then [**].
               (v) Qualcomm's obligation to pay to Broadcom the entire amounts set forth in Section 3 will remain in full force and effect without any modification, termination, refund, reduction, or offset of any kind, notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.9(b) or in any provisions that may be modified or terminated pursuant to this Section 7.9(b) or in any substitute or replacement provision, whether or not the rights or obligations of the Parties under any such provisions are materially modified by this Section 7.9(b) or are otherwise modified or terminated for any reason.
          Each Party agrees that it will not (and will ensure that each of its Subsidiaries does not): (i) claim or assert, in any Litigation (regardless of whether or not the other Party is a party to such Litigation) or in any written public statement (including press releases) issued or otherwise authorized by such Party, that [**], are exhaustive or otherwise create any Pass-Through Rights (except and only to the extent that [**]); or (ii) Support any Third Party in the making of any such claims or assertions in any Litigation. This Section 7.9(c) will not restrict a Party from claiming or asserting in Litigation, or from providing Support to any Third Party claiming or asserting in Litigation, that (x) [**]; (y) [**]. If any direct or indirect customer of a Party (or a Subsidiary of a Party) asserts an Exhaustion Claim against the other Party (or a Subsidiary of the other Party), then within thirty (30) days after written request
(c)
 
from the other Party, the first Party shall notify such customer, in a letter signed by such Party's Chief Executive Officer or General Counsel and copied to the other Party, that the only rights possessed by the first Party in the relevant patents arise from an agreement that was negotiated and designed with the intent that no exhaustive rights or other pass-through rights would be granted to the first Party or its customers for Non-Exhaustive Products, and that should the customer continue to pursue its Exhaustion Claim, the first Party will provide no Support to the customer in pursuing such claim.
          Except as expressly set forth below, each Party shall include (and shall ensure that each of its Subsidiaries includes), in each of its signed written agreements entered into with a direct customer of such Party after the Effective Date for the sale of ASICs, other integrated circuit devices, Modules, and Test Devices that are Non-Exhaustive Products, a notice to such customer in the applicable form set forth in . Beginning no later than thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, each Party shall provide such notice to its direct customers in its order acknowledgement forms for accepting purchase orders for a Non-Exhaustive Product, unless such Party has already included the notice in a signed written agreement with such customer. In addition, each Party shall (1) provide the applicable form of notice to all of its current direct customers (i.e., direct customers with which such Party or one of its Subsidiaries has, on or before the Effective Date, entered into an signed, written agreement that remains in effect for the sale of any Non-Exhaustive Products) within sixty (60) days after the Effective Date, and (2) beginning no later than thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, include or provide the applicable form of notice in or with any new signed, written agreement, or amendment to an existing signed, written agreement, with such existing direct customers for the sale of any Non-Exhaustive Product in volume production (i.e., not just prototypes or engineering samples) or for the license of any software that is a Non-Exhaustive Product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party will be required to provide notices to end user consumers. However, each Party will publish the applicable form of notice on its web site throughout the term of this Agreement.

          . During any of the following periods of time (each, a "") (i) after an Exhaustion Claim has been asserted, until the applicable covenant in Section 6 is reinstated or Section 7.9(b) applies, (ii) in which the Parties are negotiating a substitute provision pursuant to Section 7.9(b), (iii) in which a Final Judgment is being appealed, or (iv) in which the Parties are engaged in arbitration regarding a substitute provision pursuant to Sections 7.9(b) and 16.4, neither Party [**]. In addition, (1) [**], neither Party [**]; or (2) [**], neither Party [**]. Any applicable [**] for a patent infringement action based on sales of Non-Exhaustive Products made [**] will be [**]. Once a [**], if either Party (or any of its Subsidiaries) is free to make any such Assertion and does make such an Assertion, such Party (or any of its Subsidiaries) may [**] Non-Exhaustive Products made [**]; however, [**] any such Assertion against the other Party (or any of its Subsidiaries, Contractors, or Distributors). For avoidance of doubt, the [**] set forth in this Section 7.9(e) does not authorize any sales of Non-Exhaustive Products [**] or otherwise. If, during any period of time in which the Parties are negotiating a substitute provision for Section 7.4 or 7.5 or a substitute provision is being determined through arbitration, either Party Asserts in Litigation any claims of patent infringement that would be subject to such Section if it were still in effect, the substitute provision (once it is agreed upon or determined) will apply retroactively to such claims.

     . The Parties understand and acknowledge that the covenants and licenses granted in this Agreement (and any licenses that may be granted in the future pursuant to Section 7.4 or Section 7.5) are intended to cover only products of the two Parties to this Agreement (and their respective Subsidiaries), and are not intended to cover manufacturing activities that either Party (or a Subsidiary of either Party) may undertake on behalf of Third Parties. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the rights granted by one Party to the other Party and the other Party's Subsidiaries (and their respective Contractors, Distributors, and customers) in or pursuant to this Agreement (including rights under Sections 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, and 7.2 as well as rights under any licenses that may be granted in the future) do not include the right under any Broadcom Patents or Qualcomm Patents to manufacture or have manufactured products as a foundry or contract manufacturer for a Third Party based on designs provided by such Third Party in substantially completed form or to distribute such products to such Third Party or to customers of such Third Party. For avoidance of doubt, this Section 7.10 is not intended to limit either Party's rights with respect to Custom ICs or, with respect to Section 7.3(b), customized versions of Qualcomm Software Products described in the definition thereof.
7.10 No Foundry Rights
     . Third Parties who are manufacturers of Third Party ICs or direct or indirect suppliers of Third Party ICs to a Party or any of its Subsidiaries are intended third party beneficiaries of any of the covenants or licenses granted in Section 6 or Section 7 of this Agreement whether or not such Third Party ICs are incorporated into or otherwise used with any Broadcom Components, Broadcom Covenant Products, Qualcomm Components, or Qualcomm Covenant Products, as applicable. No licenses or covenants not to Assert are granted or otherwise provided to any such Third Parties for the manufacturing, using, Selling or importing of any Third Party ICs by such Third Parties, whether expressly or by implication, estoppel or otherwise.

Subject to Section 7.10, Broadcom and each of its Subsidiaries (but only as long as it remains a Subsidiary of Broadcom) hereby retain (and if the retention of such rights is not effective in any respect, Qualcomm shall grant to Broadcom and each of its Subsidiaries (but only as long as it remains a Subsidiary of Broadcom)) a perpetual and irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid and royalty-free, nonassignable and non-transferable (except as permitted under Section 14), worldwide, exhaustive license, with no right to sublicense except to its Subsidiaries, under the Designated Patents (including any patents that issue from patent applications included in the Designated Patents, any reissue, reexamination, or extension of any Designated Patent, any divisional, continuation, continuation-in-part, or foreign counterpart of any Designated Patent, and any other patent or patent application claiming direct or indirect priority from any Designated Patent, in each case which are owned at any time by Qualcomm or any of its Subsidiaries and all of which are referred to herein as "") to make, have made, import, use, offer to sell, sell, and otherwise dispose of all past, current, and future products and services of Broadcom and its Subsidiaries and to practice any process, method, or procedure. This license includes and covers all activities by Broadcom and its Subsidiaries (except licensing or sublicensing the Designated Patents or Related Patents to Third Parties) in connection with its business, including the design, development, and testing of current and future Broadcom products and Broadcom services, and the use, reproduction, incorporation, and distribution of products (including Components, software, and firmware) and services of Broadcom and its Subsidiaries by contractors, Distributors, and direct and indirect customers and users of such products and services of Broadcom and its Subsidiaries. Qualcomm covenants that it will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, (i) amend any claim in any Designated Patent (or in any patents or applications claiming direct or indirect priority from or otherwise having common priority with any Designated Patent) in such a way that is directed at subject matter included in the Designated Patents only through incorporation by reference, or (ii) amend any specification or claim to directly include any subject matter incorporated by reference in the Designated Patents. Qualcomm shall ensure that any assignment or transfer of any of the Designated Patents is made expressly subject to the license retained by Broadcom and its Subsidiaries under this Section 8.3, the obligation to license to the extent such retention is not effective in any respect, and the covenant in the preceding sentence. The above license retained by Broadcom and its Subsidiaries is non-terminable for any reason and will remain in effect (without restriction or limitation) notwithstanding any termination of other rights or obligations under this Agreement or any Change in Control of Broadcom.

          Subject to Section 9.2, Qualcomm agrees that Broadcom Components will be treated as the equivalent of Qualcomm Components under Qualcomm's Patent License Agreements for Licensed Products (the ) that are executed after May 9, 2008 (the "") for only the following purposes: (1) determining or calculating royalties owed to Qualcomm for such Licensed Products; (2) determining or calculating up-front license fees payable under the New Qualcomm Agreements; and (3) the scope of the licenses or covenants granted in each such New Qualcomm Agreement under Patents owned by Qualcomm or its Subsidiaries (or Patents that Qualcomm or its Subsidiaries otherwise have the right to license or grant covenants not to assert against Third Parties, without the payment of monetary consideration to any Third Party, for Licensed Products that do not incorporate Qualcomm Components). For clarity, clause (1) and clause (2) above are not limited to [**] only, but rather apply to [**]. With respect to any Applicable License entered into by a Subsidiary of Qualcomm before it became a Subsidiary of Qualcomm (other than Applicable Licenses entered into by Subsidiaries of Qualcomm that became Qualcomm Subsidiaries before the Effective Date), this Section 9.1 will not apply to any terms as they existed in such agreement before such Subsidiary became a Subsidiary of Qualcomm. In the event of an amendment after May 9, 2008 of an Applicable License that is not a New Qualcomm Agreement, this Section 9.1(a) will not apply to any terms as they existed in such agreement prior to May 9, 2008, subject to Section 9.1(b).

               (i) Qualcomm shall not (A) condition the provision of any Qualcomm Baseband ASIC to a customer based upon the customer not purchasing or using Broadcom Components or (B) knowingly charge a higher price for a Qualcomm Baseband ASIC when purchased for use with a Broadcom Component than for the same Qualcomm Baseband ASIC when purchased for use with a Qualcomm Component or Third Party ASIC, provided that the foregoing shall not restrict Qualcomm with respect to bundled pricing for multiple Qualcomm Components to the extent otherwise permitted by law.
               (ii) Upon request from a Qualcomm customer, Qualcomm agrees to provide such customer (under confidentiality obligations if necessary) with the [**] information (for avoidance of doubt, such information will not include [**]) reasonably necessary to [**] on a Qualcomm Baseband ASIC, for the sole purpose of [**]). For the purposes of this Section 9.3, a [**] is one that has been [**], and is not one where either Party currently has [**]. At Broadcom's written request with respect to a particular Qualcomm customer, Qualcomm will notify Broadcom whether Qualcomm has provided the information specified in this Section 9.3(a)(ii) to such Qualcomm customer.
               (iii) If Broadcom asserts that Qualcomm has engaged after the Effective Date in conduct that violates this Section 9.3(a), that conduct shall be deemed not to be Conduct/Practices for purposes of Section 4.2(c) above, such that Broadcom may bring any claim based on such conduct that would otherwise be precluded by operation of Section 4.2(c),
 
but no other claim or remedy under this Agreement, including any contract remedies, will be available for such violation of this Section 9.3(a).
          
(b) Broadcom Dealings
               (i) Broadcom shall not (A) condition the provision of any Broadcom Baseband ASIC to a customer based upon the customer not purchasing or using Qualcomm Components or (B) knowingly charge a higher price for a Broadcom Baseband ASIC when purchased for use with a Qualcomm Component than for the same Broadcom Baseband ASIC when purchased for use with a Broadcom Component or Third Party ASIC, provided that the foregoing shall not restrict Broadcom with respect to bundled pricing for multiple Broadcom Components to the extent otherwise permitted by law.

Third Party Matters
     If Qualcomm intentionally grants or has intentionally granted to any Third Party any [**] under Qualcomm Patents with respect to sales of [**] as standalone products for use in Devices that implement a WWAN Interface (other than [**] granted to a Third Party that sells or otherwise assigns patents or patent applications to Qualcomm, provided that such [**] apply solely to such sold or assigned patents and patent applications and any other patents that claim priority from such assigned patents or patent applications), then Qualcomm shall promptly notify Broadcom in writing of such fact and offer to Broadcom [**] as well as any or all, at Qualcomm's option, of the other terms and conditions in such Third Party agreement. Such notice will identify a five (5) Business Day period, to occur within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice, during which a designated attorney for Broadcom who is not a Broadcom employee (i.e., outside counsel) may inspect (at the headquarters of Qualcomm) the relevant provisions of the agreement in which such [**] were granted by Qualcomm for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of the offered terms and conditions, except to the extent that confidentiality obligations prevent Qualcomm from disclosing the relevant provisions to third parties. If Qualcomm's confidentiality obligations to such Third Party prevent Qualcomm from disclosing the relevant provisions to third parties, Qualcomm will request such Third Party's consent to disclose the relevant provisions to Broadcom's designated attorney as set forth in this Section 10. The
10.1
 
designated attorney shall be subject to reasonable confidentiality obligations to Qualcomm no less restrictive than the confidentiality obligations in this Agreement and such designated attorney shall report to Broadcom only whether or not the offered terms and conditions are accurate unless Qualcomm's confidentiality obligations to the Third Party permit additional disclosures, in which case such designated attorney may disclose to Broadcom only what is permitted under Qualcomm's confidentiality obligations to the Third Party. Subject to the verification of the accuracy of the offered terms and conditions, for sixty (60) days after the date on which Qualcomm provided the above notice or after any inspection period has expired, whichever is later, Broadcom will have the right to accept, by written notice to Qualcomm, the offered terms [**], effective as of the date such Third Party benefits from such [**]; provided that Broadcom must also accept all of the other terms and conditions of the Third Party agreement offered by Qualcomm in its notice, including any obligations to provide consideration to Qualcomm for such [**] or any of the other offered terms and conditions. If Broadcom does not provide written notice of its acceptance of all of the offered terms and conditions to Qualcomm on or before the end of such sixty (60) day period, then, provided that Qualcomm has fully complied with its obligations under this Section 10.1, Broadcom's right to accept the offered terms and conditions (including the [**] therein) will expire. For avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) Qualcomm acquires or has acquired patents or patent applications from a Third Party and such patents or patent applications are subject to agreements that grant [**] that were granted before Qualcomm acquired such patents or patent applications, Qualcomm will not be deemed to have granted such [**] and will not be required to offer such [**] to Broadcom, or (ii) a covenant or other rights granted by Qualcomm to a Third Party are determined to grant [**] despite the parties' express intent that such rights were not intended to grant [**], then this Section 10 will not apply to such [**].
     Within ten (10) days after the Effective Date and throughout the term of the Agreement, Qualcomm shall identify Broadcom as a supplier of component-related products with certain rights under Qualcomm's patent portfolio on Qualcomm's website and in such other places where Qualcomm publicly identifies other such suppliers.

13.
Termination
     . This Agreement may not be terminated or rescinded by either Party for any reason. Certain rights and obligations in this Agreement may be terminated before the end of the term of this Agreement as follows:
13.1 Termination Rights
 
(i) Broadcom has breached its obligations under Section 7.9(c) by asserting (or allowing any of its Subsidiaries to assert) a claim in Litigation after the Effective Date that any covenant in [**], or any terms or conditions in [**] (except and only to the extent that Qualcomm [**], or [**], alone or in combination with each other, create any Pass-Through Rights under any Qualcomm Patents to a Third Party; for avoidance of doubt, this Section 13.1(b) only applies to (and all references to breach in this Section 13.1(b) shall only be construed as referring to) a breach of Section 7.9(c) due to such an assertion in Litigation by Broadcom or its Subsidiary (and not to any other breach of Section 7.9(c));
(ii) Qualcomm has properly notified Broadcom in writing of such breach and identified the specific assertions and claims to be withdrawn by Broadcom to cure such breach and has provided a period of at least thirty (30) days after such notice for Broadcom to cure such breach prior to Qualcomm requesting any arbitration under Section 16.4 with respect to such breach;
(iii) Broadcom does not cure such breach by withdrawing the claim or assertion that constituted the breach of Section 7.9(c) during such thirty (30) day period after a proper notice from Qualcomm (the ""); Broadcom will be deemed to have withdrawn such claim or assertion, and to have cured such breach, immediately upon formally notifying the court, Governmental Authority or other tribunal in which Broadcom's claim or assertion is pending, that Broadcom is dismissing or withdrawing the claim or assertion that constituted the breach of Section 7.9(c);
Pre-Filing Cure Period
(iv) Qualcomm submits the matter to arbitration under Section 16.4 after the expiration of the Pre-Filing Cure Period and an arbitrator makes a final decision pursuant to arbitration under Section 16.4 that Broadcom has committed such breach of its obligations under Section 7.9(c) as set forth in (i) above in the manner alleged in Qualcomm's notice and has failed to cure such breach prior to the date that is five (5) Business Days after the Parties submitted their final pre-hearing briefs or, if there are no pre-hearing briefs, five (5) Business Days after the commencement of the arbitration hearing (such date, the "" and such final decision, a "");
Cure Deadline
First Decision
(v) Broadcom fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after being notified in writing of and provided a complete copy of such final decision of the arbitrator; and
(vi) such breach remains uncured when the termination notice is delivered after such thirty (30) day period in (v) above. Neither Qualcomm nor the arbitrator may take any position that the breach cannot be cured at any time prior to or during such thirty (30) day cure period. At any time prior to the end of the thirty (30) day cure period following a final decision of
 
the arbitrator, Broadcom will be deemed to have withdrawn such claim or assertion, and to have cured such breach, immediately upon formally notifying the court, Governmental Authority or other tribunal in which Broadcom's claim or assertion is pending, that Broadcom is dismissing or withdrawing the claim or assertion that constituted the breach of Section 7.9(c).
Broadcom shall have the right to cure a breach of Section 7.9(c) an unlimited number of times prior to the commencement by Qualcomm of an arbitration proceeding with respect to such breach under (iv) above without triggering any termination rights under this Section 13.1(b) and any such breach that is so cured will be disregarded in determining whether any termination rights are triggered by any subsequent breach under this Section 13.1(b). However, Broadcom will be allowed to cure a breach of Section 7.9(c) after the Cure Deadline pursuant to (iv) above only once (provided that such breach results in a First Decision) without triggering termination rights under this Section 13.1(b); thereafter, Qualcomm may terminate the rights set forth above (by written notice to Broadcom) for any other breach by Broadcom of Section 7.9(c) as set forth in (i) above that is not cured by Broadcom within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice from Qualcomm of such breach as set forth in (ii) and (iii) above.
In the event there is any other notice of breach of Section 7.9(c) that has been provided or any additional arbitration(s) pending in accordance with this Section 13.1(b) when the arbitrator makes a final decision under subsection (iv) above, Broadcom shall have thirty (30) days after such final decision to formally notify the court, Governmental Authority or other tribunal in which Broadcom has made the claim or assertion giving rise to Qualcomm's claim of breach in such other notice or additional arbitration(s), that Broadcom is dismissing or withdrawing such claim or assertion and thereby cure such breach without triggering any termination rights under this Section 13.1(b), and any such breach that is so cured will be disregarded in determining whether any termination rights are triggered by any subsequent breach under this Section 13.1(b).
After a First Decision, in the event that Qualcomm claims it is entitled to terminate Broadcom's rights in accordance with this Section 13.1(b) (except for a claim based on Broadcom's failure to cure the breach that was the basis of the First Decision) and Broadcom disputes such claim, such dispute shall be determined solely by arbitration under Section 16.4 and, in the event of such dispute, Qualcomm shall not be entitled to terminate Broadcom's rights in accordance with this Section 13.1(b) until after the arbitrator has ruled that Broadcom has committed a breach (other than a breach that has been cured by Broadcom within thirty (30) days after the First Decision) of Section 7.9(c) and failed to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of such breach from
 
Qualcomm. Any such arbitration shall decide only whether Broadcom committed such breach of Section 7.9(c) and failed to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of such breach from Qualcomm, and if the arbitrator decides that Broadcom has committed a breach of Section 7.9(c) that has not been cured during the applicable cure period, Qualcomm's right to terminate Broadcom's rights in accordance with this Section 13.1(b) shall be conclusively established.
then beginning on the second annual anniversary of the Effective Date, Broadcom will have the right to (x) change the Capture Period, for all purposes under this Agreement, to mean any time on or before the first anniversary of the Effective Date and/or (y) terminate in their entirety both Sections 7.1 and 7.2 with respect to sales of Components after the date of any such termination, by giving one year's advance written notice of such change to Qualcomm that is provided by Broadcom to Qualcomm no earlier than on the second anniversary of the Effective Date (for the avoidance of doubt, the earliest that such change could take effect is three (3) years after the Effective Date and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, such change will apply only to sales and other activities that occur after such change takes effect). For purposes of
 
calculating the number of [**] sold by Qualcomm or a Third Party above, multiple [**] sold as part of a single [**] will be considered one [**].
     . Except as expressly provided in Sections 6.1(d), 6.2(d), 7.8, 7.9(b), and 13.1, no provisions, rights, or obligations in or under this Agreement may be terminated by either Party for any reason, including any breach of this Agreement by the other Party. Except as provided in Section 13.1(b), the payment obligations contemplated under Section 3.1 are non-terminable, non-cancellable, and not subject to offset.
13.2 No Other Termination

Assignment and Change in Control
     
14.1 Assignment of Contract Rights
          This Agreement is assignable by a Party without the consent of the other Party only (i) in a merger, consolidation, amalgamation, or similar transaction of a Party with another Entity that results in a Change in Control of such Party, to such other Entity, subject to the terms set forth in Section 14.4 below (it being agreed that the acquisition of the capital stock of a Party by an Entity that results in a Change in Control shall be deemed not to be an assignment that is subject to this Section 14.1 but shall be subject to Section 14.4), (ii) in a merger, consolidation, amalgamation, or similar transaction of such Party with another Entity that does not constitute or result in a Change in Control, to such other Entity, (iii) by Qualcomm as expressly permitted or required under Section 14.3, or (iv) to a Parent Holding Company solely as permitted in Section 14.1(b) (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, such transaction does not constitute, involve or result in a Change in Control); in each case, provided that the assignee agrees in writing prior to such assignment to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, neither Party may assign any rights under this Agreement, or delegate any obligations under this Agreement, to any other Person (including any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any Third Party) without the express prior written consent of the other Party, which the other Party may grant or deny in its sole and absolute discretion. Any attempted or purported assignment or delegation that requires consent of the other Party and is made without such consent will be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, any permitted assignment under this Section 14.1(a) will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their permitted successors or assigns. Notwithstanding any assignment hereunder, the assigning Party shall remain liable for all payment obligations hereunder.
(a)
          If a Party creates a Parent Holding Company of such Party, such Party shall promptly either (x) assign this Agreement to such Parent Holding Company, which assignment will not require the consent of the other Party, or (y) prior to the consummation of the transaction or series of related transactions creating such Parent Holding Company, cause the Entity that will become such Parent Holding Company to agree in writing (which agreement will not require the consent of the other Party) that (1) if such Entity owns or at any time thereafter acquires (or otherwise has or obtains the right to license or grant a non-Assert covenant to the other Party as set forth herein) any patents, or such Entity creates or acquires new Subsidiaries (which are not Subsidiaries of such Party) that own or at any time thereafter have or acquire (or otherwise have or obtain the right to license or grant a non-Assert covenant to the other Party as set forth herein) any patents, this Agreement will apply to any and all such patents in the same manner (including with respect to the Capture Period) as if such patents were owned by such
(b)
 
Party; and (2) any conduct and practices of the Parent Holding Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to Section 9 in the same manner that the conduct and practices of the Party are subject to Section 9.
          For purposes of this Section 14.1, a "" of a Party means an Entity that: (i) is created by, or is a Subsidiary of, such Party; (ii) subsequently controls such Party; and (iii) at the time of the transaction as a result of which it controls such Party, is not controlled by any other Entity or Person or group of Persons (within the meaning of Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) in their capacity as voting securityholders, where "control" means direct or indirect ownership or control of more than fifty percent (50%) of the Voting Power of such Entity by another Entity.

All of the rights granted under this Agreement with respect to each Party's Patents (including rights under covenants not to Assert such Patents) are intended to run with such Patents and be binding on any future owner or assignee of such Patents. Accordingly, each Party agrees that if it, or any of its Subsidiaries, assigns or otherwise transfers any of its rights under any Patents, it will ensure that such assignment or transfer is made subject to the full maintenance of all of the licenses and non-Assert covenants set forth in this Agreement (including the licenses set forth below in this Section 14.2). With respect to any transaction or series of related transactions that causes or results in an Entity that was a Subsidiary of a Party to no longer qualify as a Subsidiary or that creates a newly formed Entity that is not a Subsidiary of a Party, and in each case such Entity owns or has the right to enforce any patents that were Broadcom Patents or Qualcomm Patents, as applicable, prior to such transaction or series of transactions, such transaction or series of related transactions will be considered a transfer of such patents for purposes of this Section 14.2(a).
(a) Assignments to Third Parties
               (i) In the event of any such transfer of Broadcom Patents by Broadcom or any of its Subsidiaries to a Third Party, then immediately prior to such transfer, Qualcomm and its Subsidiaries (but only as long as they remain Subsidiaries of Qualcomm) will automatically receive a nonexclusive, fully-paid and royalty-free, nontransferable (except as set forth in this Section 14), irrevocable and non-terminable, worldwide, exhaustive license under such transferred Broadcom Patents to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell, sell, and otherwise dispose of Qualcomm Existing Components and (solely with respect to Covered Qualcomm Functionality) all Qualcomm Evolution Components, and after such transfer Broadcom will have no rights under Section 7.6 with respect to such transferred Broadcom Patents.
               (ii) In the event of any such transfer of Qualcomm Patents by Qualcomm or any of its Subsidiaries to a Third Party other than a Qualcomm SpinCo, then immediately prior to such transfer, Broadcom and its Subsidiaries (but only as long as they remain Subsidiaries of Broadcom) will automatically receive a nonexclusive, fully-paid and royalty-free, nontransferable (except as set forth in this Section 14), irrevocable and non-terminable, worldwide, exhaustive license under such transferred Qualcomm Patents to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell, sell, and otherwise dispose of Broadcom Existing Components and (solely with respect to Covered Broadcom Functionality) all Broadcom
 
Evolution Components, and after such transfer Qualcomm will have no rights under Section 7.7 with respect to such transferred Qualcomm Patents.
          . For purposes of the foregoing and except as provided in Sections 14.2(c) and 14.3, a spin-out of a Subsidiary or newly formed Entity that contains an operating business of a Party or its Subsidiary ("") by a Party ("") by means of a public offering and/or distribution to SpinCo Parent's then-current stockholders of the equity interests in SpinCo (a ""), will be considered a "transfer" of the Patents owned by such Subsidiary or newly formed Entity for purposes of Section 14.2(a) at the time such spin-out is consummated, provided that such transaction or series of related transactions will not be a "Spin-Out Transaction" for purposes of this Section 14.2(b) if it involves the acquisition of any business or assets from any Entity that was a Third Party prior to such transaction or series of related transactions or results in a Third Party (or any group of Third Parties within the meaning of Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) becoming the "beneficial owner" (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of SpinCo representing more than fifty percent (50%) of the Voting Power of SpinCo. For a period of [**] years after the date on which the Spin-Out Transaction is consummated, the other Party shall not Assert, and shall ensure that none of its Subsidiaries Asserts, any claim of infringement (direct or indirect) of any of its Patents against SpinCo or any Subsidiary of SpinCo based on products that were, before such spin-out was consummated, protected by the covenants in Section 6.1 or 6.2, as applicable, or any bug fixes, updates or new versions of such products, unless (x) SpinCo or any of its Subsidiaries has first Asserted any claim of infringement of any of its patents against the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries or (y) a Change in Control of SpinCo occurs; provided that this non-Assert covenant will not prevent the other Party, in Patent infringement litigation initiated after the expiration of such non-Assert covenant, from seeking past damages based on Patent infringement during the period of such non-Assert covenant. SpinCo is an intended third party beneficiary of this Section 14.2(b).

Qualcomm SpinCo
          . If Qualcomm does a Qualcomm Spin of the Qualcomm Component SpinCo, Qualcomm shall elect, by written notice to Broadcom prior to the Qualcomm Spin, to either: (i) have the Qualcomm Component SpinCo covered only by Section 14.2(b) and not this Section 14.3, or (ii) assign to the Qualcomm Component SpinCo all of the rights granted to Qualcomm and its Subsidiaries under the non-Assert covenants in Sections 6.2(a), the non-Assert covenants granted by Broadcom in Section 7.2, the license granted by Broadcom in Section 7.3, the [**], the defensive suspension provisions in Section 7.7, and the provisions relating to [**] Devices in Section 7.8. If Qualcomm does not make such election by written notice to Broadcom prior to the Qualcomm Spin then the Qualcomm Component SpinCo will be subject to Section 14.2(b) and not this Section 14.3. The rights assigned by Qualcomm to the Qualcomm Component SpinCo will not be retained by Qualcomm, except that notwithstanding such assignment, Qualcomm and its Subsidiaries, and their respective Contractors and Distributors, will continue to be protected by the covenants in Section 6.2(a) as if no Qualcomm Spin had occurred. In addition, if Qualcomm does a Qualcomm Spin of the Qualcomm MediaFLO SpinCo, Qualcomm shall elect, by written notice to Broadcom prior to such Qualcomm Spin, to either: (i) have the Qualcomm MediaFLO SpinCo covered only by Section 14.2(b) and not this Section 14.3, or (ii) assign to the Qualcomm MediaFLO SpinCo all of the rights granted to Qualcomm and its Subsidiaries under the non-Assert covenants in Section 6.2(b) with respect to MediaFLO products and services. If Qualcomm does not make such election by written notice to Broadcom prior to the Qualcomm Spin then the Qualcomm Component SpinCo will be subject to Section 14.2(b) and not this Section 14.3.

Any such assignment will be conditioned on Qualcomm
(b) Assignment of Rights upon Qualcomm Spin
 
Component SpinCo and Qualcomm MediaFLO SpinCo, as applicable, agreeing in writing (provided to Broadcom prior to the Qualcomm Spin) to provide to Broadcom and its Subsidiaries, their respective Contractors and Distributors, and Broadcom Customers all rights granted under this Agreement (including under Sections 6, 7, 9.3, 10, and 11) and otherwise being bound to the obligations of Qualcomm under this Agreement as if Qualcomm Component SpinCo or Qualcomm MediaFLO SpinCo, as applicable, were substituted for Qualcomm as a Party to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that Qualcomm does not assign rights to a Qualcomm SpinCo under this Section 14.3(b) and obtain such written agreement of the Qualcomm SpinCo prior to the Qualcomm Spin, such Qualcomm Spin will be covered by the terms of Section 14.2(b).
          . If any Qualcomm Patents are transferred to a Qualcomm SpinCo as part of a Qualcomm Spin and the Qualcomm SpinCo or any of its Subsidiaries first Asserts any claim of infringement of any such Qualcomm Patents in Litigation against [**] (before such [**] has Asserted any claim of patent infringement, direct or indirect, against the Qualcomm SpinCo) based on one or more Broadcom Existing Components or, solely with respect to Covered Broadcom Functionality, Broadcom Evolution Components and such Assertion would have been barred by patent exhaustion (based on principles of patent exhaustion under U.S. law, except that exhaustion would be deemed to occur worldwide regardless of where the authorized sale was made) if Qualcomm had granted Broadcom a worldwide exhaustive license under such Qualcomm Patents for the accused Broadcom Components, then Broadcom and each of its Subsidiaries (but only as long it remains a Broadcom Subsidiary) will [**] solely for sales of the accused Broadcom Components to [**] (provided that, with respect to Eligible Broadcom Components that are Broadcom Evolution Components, this [**] will be limited to Covered Broadcom Functionality), and Section 7.7 will no longer apply to such Qualcomm SpinCo with respect to such Qualcomm Patents and with respect to such Broadcom Customer. Such [**] will apply retroactively to accused Broadcom Components sold to [**] prior to the Assertion and will also apply to accused Broadcom Components sold to [**] after to the Assertion.
(c) Rights after Qualcomm Spin
          . For avoidance of doubt, Qualcomm may make only two assignments under this Section 14.3 (one to a Qualcomm Component SpinCo and one to a Qualcomm MediaFLO SpinCo). After a Qualcomm Spin, the rights assigned to the Qualcomm SpinCo will be subject to the limitations in Section 14.4 upon any Change in Control of the Qualcomm SpinCo.
(d) Limitation on Number of Qualcomm Spins
          . If the payments in Section 3 have not been completed prior to a Qualcomm Spin, the Qualcomm SpinCo and Qualcomm will be jointly and severally liable for the remaining payments under Section 3.

Change in Control and error corrections and bug fixes thereto (together with the products described in clause (x), ""); or (z) are updates or new versions to Existing Products or are new products that are of a similar type and for a similar market as Existing Products and that do not incorporate a substantial amount of Semiconductor IP developed by or for the Acquirer or any Affiliate of the Acquirer other than such Party and such Party's Subsidiaries (""). The term "" of a Party means (1) for a Change in Control under clause (a)(i) above, any Third Party described in clause (a)(i) above, and (2) for a Change in Control under clause (a)(ii) above, the Entity, or (if the Entity is an acquisition vehicle) the parent of the Entity, that is merged, consolidated, or otherwise combined with such Party or a Subsidiary of such Party. For avoidance of doubt: the foregoing is not intended to eliminate or modify any limitations in or exclusions from the definitions of Broadcom Components, Broadcom Protected Products, Covered Broadcom Components, Broadcom Covenant Products, Qualcomm Components, Covered Qualcomm Components, Qualcomm Covenant Products, or Qualcomm Protected Products; and the Existing Products and Follow On Products of a Party that experiences a Change in Control will not include any products made available by the Acquirer or any of its Affiliates (other than such Party and its Subsidiaries) prior to the Change in Control or error corrections, bug fixes, updates, or new versions of products of the Acquirer or any of its Affiliates (other than such Party and its Subsidiaries).

16.1 Governing Law
     . Except as expressly provided in Section 16.4, the Parties agree that any dispute between the Parties arising from or relating to this Agreement will be litigated and decided solely through adjudication in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, pursuant to 10 Del.

16.2 Dispute Resolution
 
compulsory counterclaim to any claim in any jurisdiction, provided that if a defense or compulsory counterclaim under this Agreement is asserted in another jurisdiction and/or there is any dispute regarding the merits or applicability of such defense or compulsory counterclaim, then the Parties shall jointly request and stipulate that such claim be stayed pending resolution of the dispute regarding the defense or compulsory counterclaim in Delaware. If the stay request is declined in whole or in part, then such claim shall be dismissed without prejudice pending resolution of the dispute regarding the defense or compulsory counterclaim in Delaware. The Parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and waive trial by jury. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a determination that any dispute between the Parties arising from or relating to this Agreement is not subject to 10 Del.

16.3 Disputes with Third Party Beneficiaries
          A Third Party will be permitted to enforce its rights as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement solely in defense to an Assertion by Broadcom (or a Subsidiary of Broadcom), unless the Third Party is unable (due to the nature or venue of such Assertion) to enforce its rights as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement (in which case the Third Party may enforce its rights as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement in accordance with Section 16.2, provided that such enforcement shall be solely for the purpose of defense against and relief from such Assertion, and shall not include the right to seek monetary damages in connection therewith).
(a)
          A Third Party will be permitted to enforce its rights as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement solely in defense to an Assertion by Qualcomm (or a Subsidiary of Qualcomm), unless the Third Party is unable (due to the nature or venue of such Assertion) to enforce its rights as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement (in which case the Third Party may enforce its rights as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement in accordance with Section 16.2, provided that such enforcement shall be solely for the purpose of defense against and relief from such Assertion, and shall not include the right to seek monetary damages in connection therewith).
(b)
     
16.4 Resolution of Certain Disputes by Arbitration
          If Broadcom and Qualcomm cannot agree on (i) whether patent infringement claims Asserted in Litigation by Qualcomm or a Subsidiary of Qualcomm against a
(a)
 
Broadcom Customer are Qualcomm [**] Claims, (ii) whether patent infringement claims Asserted in Litigation by Broadcom or a Subsidiary of Broadcom against a Qualcomm Customer are Broadcom [**] Claims, (iii) whether a Broadcom [**] Notice or a Qualcomm [**] Notice is timely and sufficient, (iv) the amount of gross revenue received [**], (v) the amount of gross revenue received [**], (vi) the aggregate amount of [**] Qualcomm [**] Claims [**], (vii) the aggregate amount of [**] Broadcom [**] Claims [**], (viii) a substitute provision for a non-exhaustive covenant or right that has been adjudicated to be exhaustive (see Section 7.9(b)), and/or (ix) whether there has been a material breach that could result in termination under Section 13.1, whether such breach has been cured, and/or if such breach has not been cured, what further action must be taken to cure such breach to avoid termination under Section 13.1, then either Party may invoke the arbitration process set forth in this Section 16.4 by serving upon the other Party and simultaneously filing with the American Arbitration Association ("") a notice and demand for arbitration using a demand complaint, together with a request that the AAA provide within five (5) Business Days to each of the Parties a list containing the names and contact information for eight (8) candidates which are available for use as arbitrators consisting of former federal judges that have not been involved previously in overseeing or handling prior litigation or any other dispute involving the Parties and are available to start the arbitration hearing within thirty (30) Business Days after the notice and demand is filed.
AAA
          The arbitration hearing shall start within thirty (30) Business Days after the date on which either Party provides written notice to the other Party that the first Party wishes to invoke this expedited arbitration process, and will be held in a city chosen by the Party that did not invoke such arbitration at the offices and in accordance with the applicable rules of AAA in effect at that time. The sole issue or issues to be decided in arbitration will be those issues described in clauses (i) through (ix) of Section 16.4(a) above that are presented to the arbitrator. The arbitrator will not have the authority to resolve any other dispute arising under this Agreement unless the Parties expressly agree otherwise in writing. It is the intention of the Parties to proceed with any arbitration with the utmost expedition and in accordance with the schedule set forth in this Section. However, in the event any deadline set forth in Section 16.4 is not achieved, the Arbitrator, once selected, may make only such adjustments to the schedule as he or she may deem necessary, which must be consistent with the intent of the parties to complete the arbitration on an expedited basis.
(b)
          Within three (3) Business Days after receiving the list of proposed arbitrators from the AAA, the Parties shall exchange with the other Party the name of the proposed candidates from the list that it desires. The Parties shall attempt to agree on a single arbitrator within two (2) Business Days of their exchange of the names of each of their proposed candidates. If either Party consents to a candidate nominated by the other Party, that candidate shall be the arbitrator. If the Parties cannot agree on a candidate within two (2) Business Days after such exchange, then, by that same deadline, the Parties will jointly request that the two nominees confer and select an arbitrator, from the original list of eight (8) candidate arbitrators provided by AAA (but without choosing either nominee as the arbitrator), within four (4) Business Days, except that each Party may exercise one (1) strike of a listed name no later than the time of such joint request. Should the two nominees fail to agree on the selection of the arbitrator within four (4) Business Days of such joint request, then they shall proceed down the list in alphabetical order and the first candidate (not previously stricken) that is willing to serve generally consistent with the schedule set out in this Section 16.4 shall be the arbitrator and the
(c)
 
Parties shall be bound by that choice. The two nominees shall use their best efforts to complete the entire process of selecting an arbitrator within seven (7) Business Days of the date the joint request was first made.
          Unless the Parties agree in writing to additional and specific pre-hearing discovery, the only pre-hearing arbitration discovery will be (i) reasonably limited production of relevant and non-privileged documents, and (ii) the identification of witnesses to be called at the arbitration hearing, which identification must give the witness's name, general qualifications, and position, and a brief statement as to the general scope of the testimony to be given by the witness, with both activities described in (i) and (ii) to be completed fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the date on which the hearing is set to begin, unless the arbitrator determines at any time during the arbitration process that circumstances dictate that additional discovery is warranted.
(d)
          No more than three (3) days of arbitration hearings will be conducted and the arbitration hearing will be conducted on consecutive Business Days, unless the arbitrator determines that circumstances dictate that additional days of hearings are warranted. The arbitrator shall follow and apply the applicable law but need not follow the rules of evidence. The arbitrator shall enter his or her final decision no more than seven (7) Business Days following the completion of arbitration hearings. The arbitrator shall serve copies of his or her final decision on Broadcom and Qualcomm by overnight delivery, facsimile, and by email, but service will be sufficient if service is made by overnight delivery. The arbitrator's final decision will be final and binding on both Parties.
(e)
          Except for arbitration proceedings initiated pursuant to Section 16.4(a)(ix), the expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrator's fees, expert witness fees, and attorneys' fees, may be apportioned between the Parties in any manner deemed appropriate by the arbitrator. Unless and until the arbitrator decides that one Party is to pay for all (or a share) of such expenses, each Party will bear its own attorneys' and expert witness fees and both Parties will share equally in the payment of the arbitrator's fees as and when billed by the arbitrator.
(f)
          In the event of any inconsistency between the rules of AAA and the procedures set forth in this Section 16.4 or in Section 7.9(b), the procedures set forth in this Section 16.4 or in Section 7.9(b) will control.
(g)
     . If any legal action or other legal proceeding relating to this Agreement (other than an arbitration proceeding initiated pursuant to Section 16.4(a)(i)-(viii)) or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is brought by either Party against the other Party, the prevailing Party (as determined by the court) will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to any other relief to which the prevailing Party may be entitled).
16.5 Attorneys' Fees
     . Except where necessary or appropriate to (i) avoid the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations period (unless, at the request of a Party, the other Party agrees immediately in writing to its tolling) or (ii) seek or obtain injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent any actual or potential harm, prior to a Party's initiation or commencement of Litigation against the other Party with respect to any dispute, claim, or controversy arising from or relating to this Agreement (each, a ""), the Parties shall attempt to resolve such Dispute according to the following process:
16.6 Meet and Confer
Dispute
 
Nothing in this Section 16.6 will have the effect of lengthening or shortening any applicable notice or cure period in other Sections of this Agreement. This Section 16.6 will not apply to any issues subject to resolution by arbitration under Section 7.9(b) or any dispute, claim, or controversy that arises solely as a defense, including an affirmative defense or a counterclaim, to any Litigation. Additionally, nothing in this Section 16.6 will apply to claims a Party or any of its Subsidiaries may have against Third Parties.
17.
General
     . Except for the covenants and rights expressly set forth in this Agreement, no other, further, or different covenants or other rights or immunities are granted, whether impliedly, by estoppel, or otherwise, under any patents or other intellectual property rights owned, controlled, or otherwise licensable by either Party. Any licenses that may be granted in the future pursuant to Section 7.4 or Section 7.5 do not include any right to sublicense.
17.1 Reservation of Rights
     
17.2 Savings Clause for Third Party Patents
          If any Patents acquired by a Party (or any Subsidiary of a Party) after the Effective Date are subject to restrictions on such Party's (or its Subsidiary's) right to license or grant non-Assert covenants with respect to such Patents, the rights granted in (or to be granted pursuant to) this Agreement with respect to such Patents are limited to the rights that such Party (or its Subsidiary) has the right to grant. This Section 17.2(a) shall not be construed as increasing the scope or application of any rights granted in this Agreement.
(a)
 
          If a Party or any of its Subsidiaries has any interest or rights in or to any patent with a priority date prior to the end of the Capture Period that is owned by or exclusively licensed to or from a Third Party and such Party does not have the right to grant releases, covenants not to Assert, and licenses, as applicable, of the full scope of the releases, covenants not to Assert, and licenses, as applicable, set forth in this Agreement, then the releases, covenants not to Assert, and licenses granted under such patent to the other Party hereunder will be of the broadest scope that such Party or any of its Subsidiaries has the right to grant within the scope of the releases, covenants not to Assert, and licenses, as applicable, set forth in this Agreement to the extent the same would be applicable if such patent had been owned by such Party without restrictions.
(b)
          If, after the Effective Date, either Party (or a Subsidiary of a Party) obtains rights in a patent owned by a Third Party (a "") that would otherwise qualify as a Broadcom Patent or Qualcomm Patent (as the case may be) but such Party would be required to make additional payments to such Third Party or an Affiliate of such Third Party as a result of granting a release, license, or non-Assert covenant under this Agreement, then such Third Party Patent will be excluded from the definition of Broadcom Patent or Qualcomm Patent, as the case may be. However, if a patent is excluded from the definition of Broadcom Patents or Qualcomm Patents by reason of payment obligations to a Third Party and would otherwise qualify as a Broadcom Patent or Qualcomm Patent, as applicable, the other Party (i.e., Broadcom in the case of Qualcomm Patents, and Qualcomm in the case of Broadcom Patents) will have the right (but not the obligation) to include such patent under the releases, covenants not to Assert, and licenses, as applicable, granted under this Agreement (in the same manner that would apply if such patent had been owned by such Party without payment obligations) at any time so long as such other Party agrees in writing to make all payments required to be made to the Third Party as a result of such releases, licenses, and covenants not to Assert and holds the granting Party harmless with respect to such payment obligations. Each Party shall confirm whether individual identified patents are subject to this Section 17.2(c), and provide the payment terms as applicable, in response to any reasonable requests by the other Party.
(c)
Third Party Patent
          If a Party or any of its Subsidiaries has the right to enforce, or can control or cause the enforcement of, any patent that would qualify as a Broadcom Patent or Qualcomm Patent, as applicable, if owned by such Party or any of its Subsidiaries without restrictions, such Party shall not take any action (and shall ensure that none of its Subsidiaries takes any action) to enforce or consent to (unless contractually obligated to grant such consent) or cause the enforcement of such Patent against the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective products within the scope of the releases, covenants not to Assert, and licenses set forth in this Agreement, as applicable, that would apply if such patent had been owned by such Party without restrictions.
(d)
          If a Party or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled to receive any share of money damages, license fees, and/or royalties for a patent owned by a Third Party and cannot prevent the independent enforcement of such patent by the Third Party notwithstanding compliance with its obligations under subsection 17.2(d) above, then such Party and its Subsidiaries shall reimburse the other Party and its Subsidiaries for any such amounts which it actually receives if such patent is enforced against such other Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective products within the scope of the releases, covenants not to Assert, and
(e)
 
licenses set forth in this Agreement, as applicable, that would apply if such patent would qualify as a Broadcom Patent or Qualcomm Patent, as applicable, if it had been owned by such Party without restrictions.
     . The covenants not to Assert patent infringement claims set forth in this Agreement are intended to and shall be treated as the equivalent of non-exclusive licenses solely for purposes of section 365(n) of Title 11, United States Code (the ""), and both such covenants and the licenses granted under or pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be licenses of rights to "intellectual property" as defined under Section 101(35A) of the Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, each Party acknowledges and agrees that if it, as a debtor in possession, or a trustee in bankruptcy in a case under the Bankruptcy Code (the "") rejects this Agreement, the other Party, as well as each of the intended third-party beneficiaries of such covenants, may elect to retain its rights under such covenants and licenses as provided in section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code. Each Party irrevocably waives all arguments and defenses arising under 11 U.S.C. 365(c)(1) or successor provisions to the effect that applicable law excuses the Party, other than the debtor, from accepting performance from or rendering performance to an entity other than the debtor or debtor in possession as a basis for opposing assumption of the Agreements by the other Party in a case under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to the extent that such consent is required under 11 U.S.C.  365(c)(1) or any successor statute; provided, however, that the debtor in possession, or trustee-in-bankruptcy agrees in writing that any Change in Control (whether resulting from such bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise) shall remain subject to Section 14.4 above.
17.3 Bankruptcy
Bankruptcy Code
Bankruptcy Trustee
     . The relationship between the Parties as a result of this Agreement is that of independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any relationship of agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, or franchise between the Parties. No authority or right is granted to any Party to assume or create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf of or in the name of the other Party.
17.4 Independent Contractors
     . Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be delivered to either Party under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed properly delivered, given and received (a) when delivered by hand, or (b) two Business Days after being sent by registered mail, by courier, or by express delivery service, in each case to the business address set forth beneath the name of such Party below:
17.5 Notices
 
All notices that are to be delivered by a Party to the other in accordance with the preceding terms must also be faxed to such other Party's facsimile number that is specified above. A Party may change its business address and facsimile number set forth above by written notice to the other Party in accordance with this Section 17.5.
     . Each Party shall bear and pay its own fees, costs, and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation, and review of this Agreement and all other documents delivered or to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement.
17.6 Fees and Expenses
     . Except as expressly provided herein, the rights and remedies of the Parties are cumulative (and not alternative). Each Party agrees that: (a) in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the other Party of any covenant, obligation, or other provision in this Agreement, the injured Party will be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it) to (i) a decree or order of specific performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant, obligation, or other provision, and (ii) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach; and (b) the injured Party will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such decree, order, or injunction or in connection with any related action or proceeding.
17.7 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance
     . Except as expressly provided in Sections 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2, and 14.2(b) and except for each Party's Subsidiaries, there are no intended third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement. Each Party's (and its Subsidiaries') Contractors, Distributors, and direct and indirect customers are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement as provided (and solely to the extent provided) in Sections 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, and 7.2, subject to Section 16.3.
17.8 Third Party Beneficiaries
     . No failure on the part of either Party to exercise any power, right, privilege, or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of either Party in exercising any power, right, privilege, or remedy under this Agreement, will operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege, or remedy, and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege, or remedy will preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege, or remedy. Neither Party will be deemed to have waived any claim arising from this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege, or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege, or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver will not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.
17.9 Waiver
     . If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of any such provision to any Person or set of circumstances, is determined to be invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable to any extent, then (a) the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of
17.10 Severability
 
such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable, will not be impaired or otherwise affected, (b) this Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law, and (c) subject to Section 7.9(b), the Parties shall promptly negotiate a replacement provision that achieves the Parties' original intent to the maximum extent allowed by law.
     . For the purpose of interpretation of this Agreement (including the Attachments, which are part of this Agreement), the word "including" (and variations thereof such as "include" and "includes") will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation," and the words "herein," "hereof," and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole. Unless expressly stated otherwise, references to a Section of this Agreement include all subsections thereof (e.g., Section 6 includes Sections 6.1 and 6.2). Each Party acknowledges that it has participated in the drafting of this Agreement and agrees, therefore, that no rule of strict construction shall be applied against either Party. All references to days (other than Business Days), months, quarters, and years in this Agreement mean, respectively, calendar days, calendar months, calendar quarters, and calendar years.
17.11 Construction
     . This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which will constitute an original and all of which, when taken together, will constitute one agreement.
17.12 Counterparts
     . Except as expressly provided herein, the terms and conditions of this Agreement can be modified or amended only by a writing signed by authorized representatives of both Parties that specifically refers to this Agreement and expressly states the Parties' intention to amend or modify it. For Qualcomm, authorized representatives are limited to the following: the CEO of Qualcomm, the President of Qualcomm, the President of Qualcomm Technology Licensing, and the General Counsel of Qualcomm.
17.13 Amendments
     . This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement of the Parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications, and understandings between the Parties, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Limited Mutual Release between Qualcomm and Broadcom dated March 14, 2007 shall remain in full force and effect.
17.14 Entire Agreement
 
, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the Effective Date.
In Witness Whereof
 
For avoidance of doubt, the terms "MediaFLO Broadcast Standard," "Specified Mobile Broadcast Standards," "Other Broadcast Standards," and "WWAN Interface" are intended to be mutually exclusive and the terms "Component", "Device", and "End User Card" are intended to be mutually exclusive.
 
 
 
 
 
 
     (i) . For purposes of determining Covered Broadcom Functionality for Broadcom Protected Products incorporated into Portable Broadcast Devices, functionality implementing any one or more Specified Mobile Broadcast Standards will be treated as if it had not been incorporated into Broadcom Existing Components on or prior to the Introduction Deadline and therefore will not be Covered Broadcom Functionality; however, this shall not be construed as limiting functionality implementing any one or more Other Broadcast Standards in any Broadcom Existing Components from being included in Covered Broadcom Functionality for Other Broadcast Standards. In addition, this subsection (i) shall not be construed as limiting Covered Broadcom Functionality with respect to any Broadcom Protected Product that is not incorporated into a Portable Broadcast Device, whether or not implementing any one or more Specified Mobile Broadcast Standards and/or Other Broadcast Standards, including any Broadcom Protected Products incorporated into (x) set top boxes, digital video recorders, or other cable, satellite, or terrestrial television and FM/AM/HD/satellite radio receivers for use primarily at a user's premises; (y) cable or DSL modems, residential gateways, desktop computers, workstations, or servers; or (z) any Device designed to be powered primarily from an AC electrical outlet.

Products (a) incorporated into Portable Broadcast Devices, (b) that implement one or more Other Broadcast Standards in such Portable Broadcast Devices, and (c) that do not implement any portion of any MediaFLO Broadcast Standard, Covered Qualcomm Functionality will be limited solely to functionality implementing any one or more Other Broadcast Standards in Qualcomm Existing Components on or prior to the Introduction Deadline. This subsection (i) shall not be construed as limiting the covenant granted by Broadcom in Section 7.2(a) for any Qualcomm Protected Product that is incorporated into a Portable Broadcast Device.
