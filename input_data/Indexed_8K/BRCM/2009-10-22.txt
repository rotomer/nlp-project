Net revenue for the third quarter of 2009 was $1.254 billion.

Net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the third quarter of 2009 was $84.6 million, or $.16 per share (diluted), compared with GAAP net income of $13.4 million, or $.03 per share (diluted), for the second quarter of 2009, and GAAP net income of $164.9 million, or $.31 per share (diluted), for the third quarter of 2008.

"Broadcom executed well in the third quarter, generating revenue growth of over 20% sequentially for the second quarter in row," said Scott A. McGregor, Broadcom's President and Chief Executive Officer. "This strong revenue growth is well above the semiconductor industry growth rate, and was driven by a combination of our target markets continuing to recover, new product ramps and the breadth of Broadcom's product line."
"In addition, Broadcom was successful in generating strong sequential gross and operating margin leverage and cash flow from operations in the quarter. The third quarter spending included an unforecasted increase in performance-based compensation, which grew significantly due to Broadcom's strong operating performance, showing our continued focus on generating positive financial leverage."
