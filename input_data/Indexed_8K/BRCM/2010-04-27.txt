IRVINE, Calif. April 27, 2010  Broadcom Corporation (Nasdaq: BRCM) today reported unaudited financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2010.
Net revenue for the first quarter of 2010 was a record $1.46 billion. This represents an increase in net revenue of 8.9% compared with the $1.34 billion reported for the fourth quarter of 2009 and an increase of 71.3% compared with the $853 million reported for the first quarter of 2009. Net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the first quarter of 2010 was $210 million, or $.40 per share (diluted), compared with GAAP net income of $59 million, or $.11 per share (diluted), for the fourth quarter of 2009, and a GAAP net loss of $92 million, or $.19 net loss per share (basic and diluted), for the first quarter of 2009.
