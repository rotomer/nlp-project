     On November 19, 2010, Broadcom Corporation ("Broadcom") entered into a $500 million four year revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") with the lenders named therein (the "Lenders") and Bank of America, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as agents. At Broadcom's election, the aggregate amount of the commitments under the Credit Facility may be increased from time to time by an amount up to $100 million, subject to certain conditions. The Credit Facility will mature on November 19, 2014. Broadcom is required to pay interest on the amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility and a commitment fee on the actual daily unused amount of commitments under the Credit Facility, in each case at rates determinable based on Broadcom's non-credit-enhanced senior unsecured long-term debt rating.
     The Credit Facility will be available on a revolving basis until November 19, 2014. Broadcom may optionally prepay the amounts borrowed (in whole or in part) or reduce or terminate the unutilized portion of the commitments under the Credit Facility without premium or penalty at any time by the delivery of a notice to that effect as provided in the credit agreement governing the Credit Facility (the "Credit Agreement").
     The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants. Affirmative covenants include, among other things, with respect to Broadcom and its subsidiaries, delivery of financial statements, compliance certificates and notices, payment of obligations, preservation of existence, maintenance of properties, books and records and insurance and compliance with environment laws and other laws.
     Negative covenants include, among other things, with respect to Broadcom and its subsidiaries, limitations on liens, certain indebtedness, mergers, consolidations, dissolutions, liquidations and dispositions of all or substantially all assets, changes in the nature of business, transactions with affiliates and certain negative pledges. The Credit Agreement also requires Broadcom to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.25 to 1.00 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of no less than 3.00 to 1.00.
     The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, among other things, the occurrence of certain ERISA or insolvency or bankruptcy events, the occurrence of a change of control, the failure to perform certain covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, the non-payment of amounts owing under the facility or other material indebtedness, cross-acceleration with other material indebtedness, and the invalidity of any material provision of the Credit Agreement. If an event of default occurs, the Lenders may declare the loans and all other obligations under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable and require Broadcom to cash collateralize the outstanding letter of credit obligations. A bankruptcy or insolvency event causes the loans and other obligations under the Credit Agreement automatically to become immediately due and payable and the requirement to cash collateralize letter of credit obligations automatically to become effective.
     The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Credit Agreement attached as Exhibit 10.01 and incorporated herein by reference.
The information set forth above under Item 1.01 is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.

Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurodollar Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Committed Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Committed Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Committed Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Committed Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurodollar Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
