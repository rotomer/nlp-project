transaction is expected to close by the middle of 2012 and would be accretive to EPS on a non-GAAP basis by approximately $0.10 in 2012. As we have in other private and public transactions that we have undertaken, we will remain financially disciplined in our approach to this transaction.
We would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate our guidance for Q3. We expect revenue consistent with our previously guided range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion, GAAP product gross margin of flat to slightly up, and GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses of flat to down $10 million from Q2 2011 GAAP results. In addition by the end of Q3, we also expect to have approximately $4.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, up from $3.8 billion at the end of Q2.
With that, let me turn the call back to John, our operator, for questions.
 
 
Going forward, we have a lot of the same customers between the two companies and this should certainly enable us to tell an even better story to those customers going forward. And as we said in the call earlier, it significantly expands the market opportunities for us, more than doubling the size of the served market for us in this space. Eric?
John, just on the ROI, we did run an ROI analysis. We've run a discounted cash flow analysis to evaluate the appropriate price to pay on the deal. This transaction was above our cost of capital, which you can easily find on Bloomberg.
<A  Eric Brandt  Broadcom Corp.>:
I think in terms of the transaction pricing itself, it reflects what the market's view of a highly valued asset was. I mean, median transactions typically have been running around 51% on spot and this is about 56.5% and about 47% on a trailing 30-day and this is about 44. I think when you get down to it, most transactions, particularly in markets like this, typically go slightly above the 52-week high, which is consistent with what we paid. [ph] The median's above this line (13:45) and this transaction's 114. So I think, as Scott mentioned, a fast-growing, high-margin business, typically higher value than other businesses and our price and the valuation of NetLogic prior to our price reflect that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Eric, just a question on the cash that you're using, approximately how much cash will be remaining after it closes and what's the level that you feel comfortable with running the company?
<Q  Ross Seymore  Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.>:
So, as I mentioned, we'll have about $4.2 billion at the end of Q3. My guess is by the time we sort of get into the first half of next year, we'll be sort of high fours and close to five. So, we'll have sufficient cash to close the deal. In fact, if you look at the  if you take the cash, net of the cash that's on the balance sheet, and the rollover of employee equity, the net cash out from Broadcom is somewhere between $3.3 and $3.4 billion depending on how much equity converts in the market prior to close and at around high fours to five by the time you get through the first half of 2012. I think we have plenty of cash.
<A  Eric Brandt  Broadcom Corp.>:
In terms of the cash that we would typically have on hand, we've said in the past that we try to keep our cash at about half of our operating costs, which would be about between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. And so on closing of the transaction we would probably be right at that line, but given the fast and rapid cash generation of Broadcom, we'll quickly move up off of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Uche Orji from UBS. Please go ahead.
Sure. Thank you very much. First of all, [inaudible] (15:33). I dialed in late for the call. Specifically, can you talk about the competitive dynamics in this industry now? And specifically, obviously, we look at [ph] Cardamom as compared to NetLogic. When you  obviously did your due diligence, looked at both companies, can you in general talk about the company dynamics and why NetLogic within what space probably in a (15:45) slightly more competitive market in that sense?
<Q  Uche Orji  UBS Securities LLC>:
We're happy to do so. We looked at all the different competitive solutions out there, ranging from start-up companies to other established companies, and we felt, frankly, that NetLogic Microsystems had the best technology. They had some of the most advanced processors in terms of delivering performance. The way you connect multiple cores is very significant to the performance you can get out of them. And just overall, we felt that was the best solution. We also felt it was the strongest engineering team. So, that led us to this conclusion today.
<A  Scott McGregor  Broadcom Corp.>:
 
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Berger from FBR. Please go ahead.
Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, the deal makes sense to me from the all the strategic rationale. I just wanted to revisit the valuations. What are sort of the comps you looked at? What are sort of the key metrics that you looked at in valuing the deal?
<Q  Craig Berger  FBR Capital Markets>:
So Craig, we looked at a variety of different things. We looked at discounted cash flow. We looked at ROI relative to the company's cost of capital and then we looked at multiples. The hard part with multiples is that they sort of bounce around all over the place, depending on whether they're GAAP or non-GAAP. But, if you look at the next 12 month multiples, typically for some of the largest deals that were done recently, I believe the median PE multiple for next 12 months on some of the larger deals is around 22. And if you do this on a consensus basis, this is around 26.5.
<A  Eric Brandt  Broadcom Corp.>:
And again, I think that reflects the rapid growth of this business and the very high margin of this business, almost softwaresque. And so, those are the types of things we looked at. Certainly, it's a full price for the transaction, but again, we believe that we are getting a excellent first-rate asset in the market and sometimes you have to  you pay for what you get for and I think we paid the right price for this.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Ellis from Caris and Company. Please go ahead.
Yeah, congratulations on the deal and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just taking a different tack, Ron, I think investors kind of look at your business as a 3% to 5% quarterly grower. Inside a company like Broadcom and with the leverage off of their sales force and incremental relationship breadth that the business would get, what kind of growth rate do you think the NetLogic business can drive?
<Q  Craig Ellis  Caris & Co., Inc.>:
I don't want to project growth rates, how they'll change within Broadcom, but certainly I think  if you remember when we brought in RMI, which was a small step for them to become part of NetLogic, the sales channel  the larger sales channel we had had a big impact and we had a big impact on making them more successful. Brining us into Broadcom is a multiplication factor of that. It's a much greater sales force, much stronger financial resources and engineering support, et cetera. So the impact on us being part of Broadcom should be much greater than the impact we had on brining RMI into NetLogic.
<A  Ronald Jankov  Netlogic Microsystems, Inc.>:
Operator: And our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the acquisition. Are there any endmarkets where NetLogic now gives Broadcom a leadership position, let's say in areas such as security and potentially storage?
<Q  Harlan Sur  JPMorgan Securities LLC>:
This is Rajiv here, Harlan. So, if you look at the markets that NetLogic plays in, it's essentially the same markets that we are in already today with our products at Broadcom. So, for the most part in fact, NetLogic products fits in the same products that we sell into today and the same customers. Clearly, there are  there is a broader market for embedded processors beyond just the traditional comm market into storage, as an example. And we will continue to work with NetLogic and go into those markets as well. And if you look at the overall embedded processor SAM, the majority of the SAM that we are talking about is still in the communications market, but clearly there are some adjacent opportunities in storage that we can go after.
<A  Rajiv Ramaswami  Broadcom Corp.>:
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Mobley from Benchmark. Please go ahead.
 
Hi, guys. It's understandable how you're going to tie these knowledge-based processors from NetLogic Micro with your higher end Ethernet switches. And, I guess, I'm assuming that would be a good solution for line speeds less than 20 gigabits per second, but what about creating something like a network processor for the higher end portion of the market? Is that an internal development initiative or might you need to go external for that?
<Q  Gary Mobley  The Benchmark Co. LLC>:
So, I'm not sure I got your question fully here, but today if you look at most switching products, they do have a small level of on-chip, knowledge-based processors, DCAMs, but then when you want to go larger, you actually go with external engines, like what NetLogic does. And between the two companies, with our switching products, switch chips, and as well as NetLogic's knowledge-based processor, we can scale and build very high end switches and routers, as-is today without acquiring any new development.
<A  Rajiv Ramaswami  Broadcom Corp.>:
Over time, of course, we will continue to optimize how these processors tie together with our switching products. But, I think we're in good shape already in terms of being able to address the entire range of switches and routers today.
Yes. And NetLogic also last week introduced a new 100-gig multi-core processor and so that's a very high packet touch, very high throughput system called the XLPII. So again, that offers capability on, we'll call it very high packet touch version of those network processors.
<A  Scott McGregor  Broadcom Corp.>:
Operator: Our next question comes from Ruben Roy from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Thanks. I guess this is for Rajiv. When you looked at NetLogic and the two main core areas of the business, multi-core and knowledge-based processors, was there one of the two technologies that you had to have to accelerate your position in the infrastructure market, or did you look at kind of the business as a whole and decide that the entire NetLogic would drive growth going forward? Thank you.
<Q  Ruben Roy  Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.>:
It's actually a combination of both. So, first of all, we've been talking about the fact that embedded processors is a very strategic opportunity for us and we've done that for a while now. And so clearly, that was a strong impetus in our looking at NetLogic and the fact that they have one of the best processing technologies out there for multi-core, scalable, high performance embedded CPUs.
<A  Rajiv Ramaswami  Broadcom Corp.>:
Now in addition to that, the other assets that NetLogic brings to the table are actually very good as well and they're very complementary and synergistic to us. So, the knowledge-based processors which fit together with our switching and routing platforms, nice fit, will continue to grow over time. Transition from IPv4 to IPv6, as an example, will help that. Their digital front end processors that go into wireless base stations, that can be combined with our other assets that we have in this space including some in-house IP as well as our recent Microwave acquisition, will allow us to play a broader role in the wireless infrastructure market as well. So it's an overall  it's a very complementary set of assets that fits very nicely together with our current product portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sandeep Shyamsukha from Auriga USA. Please go ahead.
Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch base on your last answer. You said embedded processors sounded like the primary goal for going after this acquisition. So from that standpoint, I mean, I just wanted to see what you think about NetLogic's solution versus Cavium's solution? At least in terms of market share, currently it seems Cavium is further ahead. So what drove you towards NetLogic here?
<Q  Sandeep Shyamsukha  Auriga USA>:
 
This is Ron. I'm going to speak first. That's certainly  what's differentiated about NetLogic is the core technology going forward, and really in processors, embedded processors, it's all about driving to the next generation. And performance is becoming hugely important, particularly in wireless infrastructure where the move from 3G to HSPA+ and to 4G LTE, the performance requirements are going up dramatically. And NetLogic had the fastest and better processor right now. So even though that our market share doesn't yet show that, we're primed to have large market share gains with the most superior product, highest performance product in the market today.
<A  Ronald Jankov  Netlogic Microsystems, Inc.>:
Operator: And our next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Thank you very much. On the NetLogic products, are there any pieces of circuitry that Broadcom has that you intend to integrate into future NetLogic products? Would you expect to run the engineering groups and the lines separately going forward?
<Q  David Wong  Wells Fargo Advisors LLC>:
Yeah, so as you know, Broadcom has a lot of IP in this space that NetLogic can make use of over time. So we have a whole central engineering team that does a bunch of analog building blocks that could all be leveraged by NetLogic chips going forward. We have the ability to take our broad IP portfolio and put together SoCs that are more tightly integrated then where we're at today. So, all those are things that we could be doing in future and will benefit NetLogic products.
<A  Rajiv Ramaswami  Broadcom Corp.>:
Operator: Our next question comes from Sachin Shah from Tullet Prebon. Please go ahead.
Hi. Good morning, just had a few questions on the regulatory approvals. Just to  I saw the merger agreement there. [ph] They just are as (26:13) required  you have the Taiwanese approval, as well as the Chinese approval. So just wanted to find out as a clarification, are there any issues that you see from those approvals? Are there any other approvals that are not mentioned within the merger agreement?
<Q  Sachin Shah  Tullet Prebon>:
We  those are the expected approvals that are required, the three that you mentioned. We do not believe there are others. There may be one or two other, smaller countries as we look more closely. We don't anticipate issues. Our products are complementary and often sit next to each other. They're not  there isn't a high degree of overlap between the two products, so  or two sets of products. So, we believe that we'll be able to work our way through the process, and as we mentioned, close in the first half of next year.
<A  Eric Brandt  Broadcom Corp.>:
Operator: Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just curious on how long will the integrated roadmap  you've mentioned connectivity, bandwidth and intelligence coming out of this deal and integrating the various pieces together. How long will have that take and what's your vision for that? What are the kind of advantages, whether it's tower price or anything else that customers are really going to derive from this and over what timeframe do you expect to be able to deliver it?
<Q  Stacy Rasgon  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.>:
Sure. So, in the short term, it's obviously about putting the products together into more of an integrated solution, rather than an indicted SoC and allowing customers to get these products faster to market, because they get a whole solution from us in terms of software, pre-tested, things put together already, a solution aspect of this.
<A  Rajiv Ramaswami  Broadcom Corp.>:
 
Now longer term, what we can do is to figure out what functions go in where. So, we can talk about what to do inside the switches that we do, what to do inside the processors that NetLogic brings to the table. We can optimally partition these functions across these two products and create a lower power, more integrated solution. And then if you look one step, at the same time while we're doing that, we already are looking at integrating processor cores into our switch chips. And today, some of our switch chips already have those and we will continue to expand that integration over time as well.
And so it sounds like that integration planning is still an ongoing process.
<Q  Stacy Rasgon  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.>:
Very much so, we expect to be planning that and we expect to hit the ground running once the deal closes.
<A  Rajiv Ramaswami  Broadcom Corp.>:
All right. Thank you.
<Q  Stacy Rasgon  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.>:
Operator: Our next question comes from Glen Yeung from Citi. Please go ahead.
Hi, this is [ph] Jean Ho (28:52) for Glen Yeung. Just wondering post the merger closing, can you describe the competitive environment and does Broadcom expect a competitive response in terms of M&A from other competitors?
<Q>:
The market continues to be very competitive. We have many competitors in different segments of this market, everything that we play in. We have a set of competitors on the switch side. We have a set of competitors on the [ph] pie (29:21) side. And we expect there to be a healthy set of competitors in the market long term and we expect to win based on the best execution and the best technology we bring to the market.
<A  Rajiv Ramaswami  Broadcom Corp.>:
Operator: Our next question from Arnab Chanda from Roth Capital. Please go ahead.
Thank you very much. Congratulations, Ron. That was a great ride. Question for Eric and just  this is not something that  this is obviously before your time, but Broadcom was in the processor business and did not do very well and ended up shutting it down. Could you talk a little bit about how you intend to sort of pursue this business that would be different from the past? I realize it's not a fair question, because you guys were not there at the company, but just wanted to make sure of your strategic focus on it.
<Q  Arnab Chanda  ROTH Capital Partners LLC>:
Yes. I think NetLogic, first of all, has proven itself already by bringing this next generation XLP to market. They're already well established, advancing very well and it's a  we have done our diligence. We don't expect to see too many surprises here. And the other thing I think we've realized is that there is a significant long-term investment required here to play in this game and make sure as we continue to carry this forward with every generation of technology. So, NetLogic today is at 40-nanometers. They've already announced technology, products at 28-nanometers. And we expect to continue that investment at Broadcom and if anything, continue to add to it over time. And that's really, ultimately the recipe for success here in this business.
<A  Eric Brandt  Broadcom Corp.>:
Operator: Our next question is from Sandy Harrison from Wunderlich. Please go ahead
Yeah. Thanks for taking my call and again, nice job Ron. Just on the comments you just had, if you look at what NetLogic has done, they've introduced the new products at 28-nanometer and I think everything there, it's now sub-50 nanometer. How quickly  or I guess the first part would be how closely tied are you, or could you
<Q  Sandy Harrison  Wunderlich Securities, Inc.>:
 
switch over to the NetLogic processor or process geometries and how quickly would you expect to take the rest of the Broadcom product to the level where NetLogic is currently?
Broadcom is currently developing products in 28-nanometer today. So, we all use industry standard processes to do that. So, certainly NetLogic, already in 28-nanometer with announced products there. Broadcom typically announces products as they ship to market, so a slightly different emphasis, but we have 28-nanometer products in development as well. So, we'll both be pushing forward on that node.
<A  Scott McGregor  Broadcom Corp.>:
And then just a quick follow-up, the digital frontend that NetLogic recently acquired, how well does that fit up with your Beceem and other acquisitions that you've made in the wireless infrastructure place?
<Q  Sandy Harrison  Wunderlich Securities, Inc.>:
So, the digital frontend fits very nicely on the infrastructure side, not on the hand side. So, if you look at what we have today in the wireless infrastructure market with the combination, so we have our switch chips that we are selling for backhaul applications and we have a very good presence over there with the microwave assets. Again, we cemented our position in backhaul and with the DFE assets from NetLogic, we are able to get into the base stations as well as the embedded processors.
<A  Rajiv Ramaswami  Broadcom Corp.>:
Between those two, we are able to now have a bigger role inside the base stations as they evolve to LTE and beyond. So, overall, between the combination of Broadcom and NetLogic products put together, it significantly expands our addressable market in wireless infrastructure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Myers from Crosslink Capital. Please go ahead.
Hi, questions for Ron and Eric. Could you talk about break-up fees and also when we see the merger documents, are we going to see that more than one bidder appeared here and was this actually a sale process or was it a purchase process at Broadcom? Thank you.
<Q  Dan Myers  Crosslink Capital>:
You'll see in the document that the break-up fee is 3.25%. That was negotiated between the two companies. And the process that we went through  I mean if we take one step back, it was part of our broader strategic planning process in terms of both use of internal and external capital in terms of balance sheet and P&L dollars. And then the negotiation between the two sides was exclusive and not [indiscernible] (34:02).
<A  Eric Brandt  Broadcom Corp.>:
Great. So, when we see the documents, we'll see that you looked at multiple other companies that were [ph] built us several [indiscernible] environment (34:11)?
<Q  Dan Myers  Crosslink Capital>:
You will not see that in the documents, but we do that as part of our process on an annual basis and we have looked across the environment across a whole variety of different things and I would say what we concluded is one of our top strategic priorities was to improve our position in embedded processors and this transaction absolutely moves us forward substantially relative to where we are today.
<A  Eric Brandt  Broadcom Corp.>:
Operator: Our next question comes from Sachin Shah from Tullet Prebon. Please go ahead.
Hi. I just wanted to follow up. You mentioned earlier that this deal wasn't about synergy. So, with the market volatility as we currently have, just wanted to find out, how did you feel comfortable paying the price that you did and not having significant near-term synergies, at least on the cost side?
<Q  Sachin Shah  Tullet Prebon>:
 
So, when we looked at the transaction, we're firm believers that value is defined by revenue growth and gross margin. And this acquisition is accretive to both Broadcom's revenue growth and its gross margin. So first and foremost, we believe it's value-enhancing to the corporation. I think, secondarily we looked very closely at discounted cash flows, return on capital, and to add premiums that were paid in similar transactions. As I mentioned earlier, if you look at similar transactions, again the premium we paid is very close to the range that was provided in similar transactions and that's how we arrived at the number.
<A  Eric Brandt  Broadcom Corp.>:
Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
<Q  Sachin Shah  Tullet Prebon>:
Operator: Our next question comes from Anil Doradla from William Blair. Please go ahead.
Yes. Hey, Ron, congratulations on the take-out, a couple quick questions. Broadcom just mentioned that there will be some levels of investment in the business. Can you give us a sense of how much investment are you thinking about in the business and how should we be looking at an incremental dollar from NetLogic's perspective at least? And the second thing was, Ron, are you able to catch up with your key customers and share with this potential acquisition and give us some sense of what their feedback has been?
<Q  Anil Doradla  William Blair & Co. LLC>:
In terms of investments  this is Scott. We will continue to invest in this business. Our infrastructure and networking business is a strong performer and this is an example today of investing in that business, of putting significant cash infusion to help to grow that and we anticipate to continue to fuel that portfolio going forward.
<A  Scott McGregor  Broadcom Corp.>:
And, could you give us sense of magnitude, how much there might be some incremental spending from Broadcom's point of view over the next 12 to 24 months for  anyway in NetLogic?
<Q  Anil Doradla  William Blair & Co. LLC>:
We don't break that out, but we do have a portfolio review process that we go through when we look at the opportunities for investment across our whole portfolio. And we endeavor to put our P&L dollars into the places that generate the most value going forward. And, so we will look to this as one of those investment areas going forward.
<A  Scott McGregor  Broadcom Corp.>:
Just to add to that, I mean when we close the transaction there are a couple of things, couple effects, that will happen, one which relates to purchase accounting, which would cause a couple of things. One is the step-up of the inventory, which you've seen on other transactions we've done. I don't have an answer to that, but as NetLogic is holding somewhere around a quarter worth of inventory at its gross margins, you can assume that that inventory will be stepped up consistent with the distributor margin, which could be mid-single digits. So it's a pretty high step up and that will work its way through the P&L on a  that would be on a GAAP basis. We typically break that out for you on a non-GAAP basis.
<A  Eric Brandt  Broadcom Corp.>:
In addition, there will be a variety of purchase intangibles that we will need to book as part of the purchase price allocation and those would run through the amortization line and some may run through the COGS line. My guess is for some period of time, we will be working with both systems in trying to integrate between the two companies. We do that fairly quickly.
Beyond that, as Scott mentioned, we have a portfolio process. We are not anticipating significant changes to resourcing of the businesses. And again, this reflects a use of both assets that the company has, its P&L dollars and R&D, which we have allocated probably mostly to the wireless business, and some of our balance sheet dollars, which today as you can see, mostly allocated to our high margin [indiscernible] (3848) business.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time.
