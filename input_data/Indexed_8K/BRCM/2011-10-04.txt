On September 28, 2011, Broadcom Corporation ("Broadcom"), completed its offer to exchange up to $300,000,000 of their outstanding 1.500% Senior Notes issued on November 1, 2010 due 2013 and $400,000,000 of their outstanding 2.375% Senior Notes issued on November 1, 2010 due 2015 (the "Old Notes") for 1.500% Senior Notes due 2013 and 2.375% Senior Notes due 2015, respectively, that have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "New Notes"). The exchange offer was made in order to satisfy certain obligations of Broadcom contained in a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2010. The exchange offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on September 28, 2011. An aggregate principal amount of $300,000,000 of the outstanding 1.500% Senior Notes issued on November 1, 2010 due 2013 and $399,949,000 of the outstanding 2.375% Senior Notes issued on November 1, 2010 due 2015 were exchanged. The New Notes are substantially identical to the Old Notes, except that the New Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and, as a result, the transfer restrictions and registration rights provisions applicable to the Old Notes do not apply to the New Notes.
