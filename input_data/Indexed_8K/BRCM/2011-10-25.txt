The information in Item 2.02 of this Current Report, including Exhibit 99.1, is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section.

On October 25, 2011 Broadcom Corporation (the "Company" or "Broadcom") issued a press release announcing unaudited financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Broadcom reports the following measures in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, and on a non-GAAP basis: (i) cost of product revenue, (ii) product gross profit, (iii) product gross margin, (iv) research and development and selling, general and administrative expense, (v) net income, (vi) weighted average shares outstanding (diluted), and (vii) diluted net income per share, referred to collectively as "non-GAAP financial measures". These non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, as well as charges related to acquisitions, employer payroll tax expense on certain stock option exercises and non-recurring, infrequent or unusual charges and gains that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to the Company's core operating performance. Non-GAAP net income per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income by non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding (diluted). For this purpose, the calculation of GAAP weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) is adjusted to exclude the benefits of compensation costs attributable to future services and not yet recognized in the financial statements that are treated as proceeds assumed to be used to repurchase shares under the GAAP treasury stock method.
Broadcom believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Broadcom's management believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability among and between results from prior periods or forecasts and future prospects, and also facilitates comparisons with other companies in the Company's industry, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results. Broadcom's management has historically used these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating operating performance, because Broadcom believes that the inclusion or exclusion of the items described below provides insight into its core operating results, its ability to generate cash and underlying business trends affecting performance. Broadcom has chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform additional analyses of past, present and future operating performance and as a supplemental means to evaluate the Company's ongoing core operations. Externally, Broadcom believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with the Company's GAAP financial information, is useful to investors in their assessment of Broadcom's operating performance and the valuation of the Company.
Internally, these non-GAAP financial measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These Non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for one or more of the following items:
 
 
 
 
Additionally, the calculation of non-GAAP net income per share uses non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding (diluted). The treasury stock method used to calculate GAAP weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) requires amounts related to compensation costs attributable to future services and not yet recognized in the financial statements to be treated as proceeds that are assumed to be used to repurchase shares. As a result, this reduces the total number of weighted average shares for purposes of calculating GAAP weighted average shares outstanding (diluted). Since Broadcom does not include the effects of these compensation costs in its non-GAAP net income, management believes these amounts should not be applied to the repurchase of shares in calculating non-GAAP net income per share, and, accordingly, adds such shares back into weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of
Broadcom's business as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Broadcom's results as reported under GAAP. Broadcom expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from Broadcom's non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Some of the limitations in relying on non-GAAP financial measures are:
