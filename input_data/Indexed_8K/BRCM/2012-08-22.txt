Item 8.01 Other Events.
On August 15, 2012, Scott McGregor, President and Chief Executive Officer of Broadcom Corporation ("Broadcom"), adopted a pre-arranged stock trading plan to exercise Broadcom stock options and to sell the acquired shares of Broadcom stock thereunder (the "August 2012 Plan"). The stock options subject to the August 2012 Plan were granted in January 2005 upon Mr. McGregors commencement of employment with Broadcom and will expire in January 2015. Under the August 2012 Plan, certain specified amounts of shares will be sold on a weekly basis provided that specified trading prices are achieved. Mr. McGregor may sell up to 520,000 shares of Broadcom stock in total under the August 2012 Plan and the plan is scheduled to terminate in March 2013, or earlier upon certain specified events. The primary purpose of the August 2012 Plan is to liquidate the stock options thereunder in an orderly fashion prior to their expiration. Mr. McGregor also maintains a separate pre-arranged stock trading plan adopted on May 17, 2012, which is scheduled to terminate in January 2013. Depending on the number of stock options remaining at or around the termination date of the August 2012 Plan, Mr. McGregor may in the future enter into one or more plans similar to the August 2012 Plan. The transactions under the August 2012 Plan and any other of Mr. McGregors pre-arranged stock trading plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each plan was adopted in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Broadcoms policies regarding stock transactions. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock. Using these plans, individuals can prudently and gradually diversify their investment portfolios over an extended period of time.
