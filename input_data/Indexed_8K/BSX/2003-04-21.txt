ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS. (c) Press Release issued by Boston Scientific Corporation dated April 21, 2003. ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE. On April 21, 2003, Boston Scientific Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the Company's earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the Company also discloses pro forma or non-GAAP results of operations that exclude certain charges. The Company reports pro forma results in order to better assess and reflect operating performance. These results are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Management believes the pro forma measure helps indicate underlying trends in the Company's business, and management uses pro forma measures to establish operational goals. Earnings guidance is provided only on a pro forma basis due to the difficulty in forecasting and quantifying the amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure. Pro forma information should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for GAAP measures. A copy of the release is furnished with this report as an exhibit pursuant to "Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition" of Form 8-K in accordance with SEC Release Nos. 33-8216 and 34-47583. The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing. 2
SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ ================================================================================ NEWS ================================================================================ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION ONE BOSTON SCIENTIFIC PLACE NATICK, MA 01760-1537 www.bostonscientific.com BOSTON SCIENTIFIC ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS Natick, MA (April 21, 2003) -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2003. Net sales for the first quarter were $807 million as compared to $675 million for the first quarter of 2002, an increase of 20 percent. Excluding the favorable impact of $38 million of foreign currency fluctuations, net sales were $769 million, an increase of 14 percent. Net income for the quarter, excluding net special charges, increased 31 percent to $117 million, or $0.28 per share (diluted), as compared to $89 million, or $0.22 per share, excluding net special charges, in the first quarter of 2002. Reported net income for the quarter, including net special charges of $20 million, was $97 million, or $0.23 per share, as compared to reported net income of $82 million, or $0.20 per share, in the first quarter of 2002. The net special charges for the quarter include purchased in-process research and development costs of $13 million primarily related to the recent acquisition of InFlow Dynamics, Inc., and a $7 million charge related to litigation with the Federal Trade Commission. "We made progress on a number of fronts during the first quarter," said Jim Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific. "First, we experienced double-digit growth in each of our six operating divisions on a worldwide basis. Our coronary stent business was up 80 percent from the prior year. We began the launch of our TAXUS(TM) drug-eluting coronary stent system in Europe and other international markets, and we have been gratified by its enthusiastic reception. In the U.S., we filed the first two modules of our TAXUS Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application and were granted expedited review status by the FDA. We also reported excellent 12-month -- more --
Boston Scientific Corporation/Page 2 April 21, 2003 follow-up data from our TAXUS II clinical trial, completed enrollment in TAXUS VI, and are currently enrolling patients in TAXUS V at a rapid rate. Further, last week we filed our third TAXUS module with the FDA." "We were also pleased to see our Neurovascular business perform well in the quarter as we continued to roll out our Matrix(TM) Detachable Coil and our Neuroform(TM) Microdelivery Stent System," added Tobin. "These products represent pioneering technology and provide clinicians with powerful new options for treating cerebral aneurysms less invasively. In addition, we were encouraged by the progress of our European and Intercontinental teams, as they turned in strong performances for the quarter." Boston Scientific officials will be discussing these and other issues with analysts on a conference call at 5:30 p.m. (ET) Monday, April 21. The Company will webcast the call to all interested parties through its website www.bostonscientific.com. Please see the website for details on how to access the webcast. The webcast will be available for 10 business days on the Boston Scientific website. Boston Scientific is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices.
