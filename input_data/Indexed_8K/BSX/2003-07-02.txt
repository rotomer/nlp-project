"TAXUS represents an enormous opportunity for Boston Scientific," said Jim Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific. "We are investing what is required to be prepared for U.S. leadership, including the addition of approximately 1200 employees this year who will work on TAXUS, the vast majority in manufacturing. The early successes we've experienced where we have launched TAXUS provide us growing confidence in the potential for TAXUS to become the leading drug-eluting stent in the world in 2004."

Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or as superior to, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Guidance is 2
provided on a pro forma basis due to the difficulties associated with forecasting and quantifying the amounts to be included in GAAP measures. This press release contains forward-looking statements. The Company wishes to caution the reader of this press release that actual results may differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements and may be adversely affected by, among other things, risks associated with new product development and introduction, clinical trials, regulatory approvals, competitive offerings, operational expansion, the Company's overall business strategy and other factors described in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
