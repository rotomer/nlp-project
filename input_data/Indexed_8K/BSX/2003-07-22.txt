Excluding the favorable impact of $40 million of foreign currency fluctuations, net sales were $814 million, an increase of 15 percent.

The net special charges for the quarter include purchased in-process research and development costs of $12 million (after-tax), or $0.03 per share, related to acquisitions. "This was our first full quarter of TAXUS sales in Europe and other international markets, and we were encouraged by the enthusiastic reception, which has resulted in our achieving what we believe to be unit market share leadership in those markets where TAXUS has been launched," said Jim Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific. "Momentum continues to build for TAXUS, and we feel this bodes well for our U.S. launch. The quarter also saw further progress in our TAXUS clinical program, with the filing of our Pre-Market Application with the FDA and the presentation of strong follow-up data from three clinical trials and a transitional registry."
