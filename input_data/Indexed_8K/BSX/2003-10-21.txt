Net sales for the third quarter increased 21 percent to $876 million as compared to $722 million for the third quarter of 2002. Excluding the favorable impact of $27 million of foreign currency fluctuations, net sales for the quarter were $849 million, an increase of 18 percent. Net income for the quarter, excluding net special charges, increased 38 percent to $137 million, or $0.32 per share (diluted), as compared to $99 million, or $0.24 per share, excluding net special credits, for the third quarter of 2002. Reported net income for the quarter, including net special charges of $13 million (after-tax), was $124 million, or $0.29 per share, as compared to reported net income of $161 million, or $0.39 per share, for the third quarter of 2002. (The third quarter of 2002 included special after-tax credits of $62 million.) The net special charges for the quarter include purchased in-process research and development costs of $8 million (after-tax), or $0.02 per share, related to acquisitions, as well as $5 million (after-tax), or $0.01 per share, in payments related to product liability settlements. (The per share amounts do not reflect the previously announced 2-for-1 stock split, which is scheduled to take effect November 5th.) "This was a record quarter for sales, fueled in part by continued strong TAXUS sales as we further strengthened our competitive position in those markets where TAXUS has been launched," said Jim Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific. "We experienced double-digit growth in both our Cardiovascular and Endosurgery groups, as well as in our domestic and international businesses. We were especially pleased to see 33 percent growth in U.S. sales of our PTCA(1) balloons." "The quarter was also marked by the announcement of our extraordinary TAXUS IV clinical results, and we are looking forward to our FDA panel meeting next month," added Tobin. "During the quarter we invested heavily in preparation for the launch of TAXUS in the United States. We are taking all measures necessary to position us for a successful launch when we receive approval from the FDA." (1) Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty -- more --
