GALWAY INSPECTION - ----------------- On Friday, an inspection team from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded a week-long inspection of Boston Scientific's drug-eluting stent manufacturing facility in Galway, Ireland. The team indicated its intention to recommend to the FDA that the facility be approved to manufacture the TAXUS(TM) Express2(TM) paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system for the U.S. market. The inspection was the first of two the FDA plans to conduct. The second is scheduled to take place at the Company's facility in Maple Grove, MN during the first week of February. "We had record sales for both the year and the quarter," said Jim Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific. "It was a solid 12-month effort by the entire organization. During the quarter, our TAXUS drug-eluting stent system continued to build momentum, posting healthy sales increases in Europe and other international markets. We're prepared to launch TAXUS in the U.S. later this quarter, and we are looking forward to bringing the benefits of this revolutionary technology to patients here in the U.S. The Galway inspection was very good news, and it is further testimony to our commitment to quality and excellence. I want to congratulate all those involved with this successful outcome." The Company plans to release final results for its fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2003 through a press release, analyst conference call and webcast on February 2nd. The Company plans to host an analyst meeting in New York on February 23. The Company will webcast the meeting to all interested parties through its website: www.bostonscientific.com.
