Reported net income for the quarter increased 100 percent to $194 million, or $0.23 per share (diluted), as compared to $97 million, or $0.11 per share, in the first quarter of 2003. Net income for the prior year included net special charges of $20 million, or $0.03 per share. The Company received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on March 4th to market its TAXUS system in the United States, and it recorded its first commercial sale on March 8th. Net sales of its TAXUS system in the United States for the first quarter were $98 million. Worldwide net sales of all coronary stent systems during the first quarter were $284 million, of which $216 million were TAXUS systems.
