EXHIBIT 99.1 ------------ NEWS BOSTON FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE SCIENTIFIC Boston Scientific Corporation One Boston Scientific Park Natick, MA 01760-1537 508-650-8000 www.bostonscientific.com BOSTON SCIENTIFIC ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS Natick, MA (July 26, 2004) -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2004. Net sales for the second quarter were $1.460 billion as compared to $854 million for the second quarter of 2003, an increase of 71 percent. Excluding the favorable impact of $31 million of foreign currency fluctuations, net sales were $1.429 billion, an increase of 67 percent. Net income for the quarter, excluding net special charges, increased 200 percent to $377 million, or $0.44 per share (diluted), as compared to $126 million, or $0.15 per share, excluding net special charges, in the second quarter of 2003. The results include the net impact of the previously announced recall of certain units of the Company's TAXUS(TM) Express(2)(TM) paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent systems and Express(2)(TM) coronary stent systems, in the amount of $57 million (after-tax), or approximately $0.06 per share. The recall impact consists of a $78 million (pre-tax) reduction to gross margin, including a sales reversal of $35 million and an inventory write-off of $43 million. The results also include a $0.01 dilution to earnings from the operating results of Advanced Bionics, which Boston Scientific acquired on June 1, 2004. Reported net income for the quarter, including net special charges of $64 million (after-tax), was $313 million, or $0.36 per share, as compared to reported net income of $114 million, or $0.13 per share, in the second quarter of 2003. The net special charges reflect purchased in-process research and development costs related to acquisitions. "We experienced impressive growth across all our businesses and regions, and we are reporting new records in both sales and earnings," said Jim Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific. "We were especially pleased with the strong conversion rate to drug-eluting stents in the United States, which reached more than 80 percent by the end of the quarter. This resulted in a significant leveraging of our profitability, and we will be working hard to ensure it continues in the coming quarters." Boston Scientific officials will be discussing these and other issues with analysts on a conference call at 9:00 a.m. (ET) Monday, July 26. The Company will webcast the call to all interested parties
