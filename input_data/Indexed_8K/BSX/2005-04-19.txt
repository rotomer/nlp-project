Worldwide coronary stent sales for the first quarter were $721 million as compared to $284 million for the first quarter of 2004, an increase of 154 percent.

The net special charges for the quarter consisted of purchased in-process research and development costs related to the acquisition of Advanced Stent Technologies. "This was another record quarter, thanks in large part to the ongoing success of the TAXUS Express(2) paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system," said Jim Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific. "In the coming quarters, we expect our recent dramatic growth to return to more moderate levels, following a full year of TAXUS system sales in the U.S. I want to congratulate our entire team for achieving global leadership in the drug-eluting stent market. Maintaining this leadership will continue to be our number one priority." --more--
