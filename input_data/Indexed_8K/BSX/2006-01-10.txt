Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
that it has submitted to Guidant Corporation (NYSE: GDT) a definitive offer to acquire all the outstanding shares of Guidant for a combination of cash and stock worth $72 per Guidant share, or $25 billion in the aggregate.  This offer is set forth in a merger agreement that was executed by Boston Scientific and delivered to Guidant today.
Natick, MA (January 8, 2006)  Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) announced today
 
Under the terms of Boston Scientific's offer, each share of Guidant common stock will be exchanged for $36 in cash and $36 in Boston Scientific common stock, based on the average closing price of Boston Scientific common stock during the 20 consecutive trading day period ending three days prior to Guidant's shareholder meeting to approve the transaction.  If the average closing price of Boston Scientific common stock during such period is less than $23.62, Guidant shareholders will receive 1.5241 Boston Scientific shares for each share of Guidant common stock, and if the average closing price of Boston Scientific common stock during such period is greater than $28.86, Guidant shareholders will receive 1.2474 Boston Scientific shares for each share of Guidant common stock.
 
Boston Scientific's offer price represents a premium of approximately 12 percent over the purchase price proposed to be paid by Johnson & Johnson under the revised merger agreement between Guidant and Johnson & Johnson, based on the closing price of Johnson & Johnson common stock on Friday, January 6, 2006.
 
  Boston Scientific announced last month that it would divest Guidant's vascular intervention and endovascular businesses to enable it to rapidly secure antitrust approval for the acquisition of Guidant.
In a separate announcement today, Boston Scientific said that it has executed a binding definitive agreement with Abbott (NYSE: ABT) under which Abbott will purchase Guidant's vascular intervention and endovascular businesses, assuming completion of Boston Scientific's proposed acquisition of Guidant.  As part of this agreement, Boston Scientific will share rights to Guidant's drug-eluting stent portfolio with Abbott, providing Boston Scientific a second DES platform.
 
 Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.50 and $1.66 in 2007 and $1.98 and $2.18 in 2008.  (Adjusted EPS is defined in Appendix A.)
The combined company will have significant scale, accelerated top- and bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.  In 2007, the first full year of the combined operations, Boston Scientific expects $10 billion in pro forma sales.  The combined company's sales are expected to grow at a double-digit rate achieving $16 billion in sales in 2011. 
 
Boston Scientific expects to retain an investment grade rating following completion of the transaction, and to rapidly pay down its incremental debt with substantial free cash flow.
 
"The combination of Guidant and Boston Scientific will create a global leader in cardiovascular devices, accelerating diversification and growth," said Pete Nicholas, Chairman of Boston Scientific.  "We are bringing together Guidant's leadership position in the fast-growing, underpenetrated cardiac rhythm management business with the strength of Boston Scientific's cardiovascular, endosurgery and neuromodulation businesses.
 
" said Nicholas.
"With the addition of the collar and the Abbott transaction, we believe our $72 definitive offer provides Guidant certainty of value and a rapid path to closing.  Compared to the agreement between Guidant and Johnson & Johnson, Boston Scientific is providing superior value to Guidant shareholders today and over the long-term.  We are confident that the shareholders, employees and customers of both Guidant and Boston Scientific will realize substantial benefits from this compelling combination,
 
Over the past month, a team from Boston Scientific, together with its legal and financial advisors, has conducted due diligence on Guidant's businesses and operations around the world.  Boston Scientific is satisfied with the results of this due diligence review.
 
"Our due diligence confirmed our belief in the underlying value of the company and the significant long-term potential we see in a Boston Scientific/Guidant combination," said Jim Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific.  "Although Guidant faces challenges, we are confident that with the combined experience and talent of our two organizations we will be able to manage them effectively and generate significant growth for shareholders of the combined company.
"Our two companies share similar cultures, so we anticipate that the integration process will be smooth," said Tobin.  "With the support of both companies' management teams, we will ensure that our mutual resources and capabilities join together collaboratively and that the commitment to innovation and excellence for which both organizations are known will thrive."

Board of Directors
Guidant Corporation
111 Monument Circle, Suite 2900
Indianapolis, IN 46204
Attn: James M. Cornelius
Chairman of the Board
 
Dear Jim:
 
We have completed our due diligence review of Guidant Corporation and are delighted to now submit a definitive offer to combine the businesses of our two companies.  The terms and conditions of our definitive offer are reflected in the signed copy of the merger agreement that we have attached to this letter and are otherwise described herein.
Under our offer, Boston Scientific would acquire all the shares of Guidant for a combination of cash and stock at a price of $72 per Guidant share.  Each share of Guidant common stock will be exchanged for $36 in cash and $36 in Boston Scientific common stock, based on the average per share closing price of Boston Scientific common stock during the 20 consecutive trading day period ending three days prior to Guidant's shareholder meeting to approve the transaction, provided that if the average closing price of Boston Scientific common stock during such period is below $23.62, Guidant shareholders will receive 1.5241 Boston Scientific shares for each share of Guidant common stock, and if the average closing price of Boston Scientific common stock during such period is above $28.86, Guidant shareholders will receive 1.2474 Boston Scientific shares for each share of Guidant common stock.
 
Our offer price provides Guidant shareholders with approximately $3 billion of additional aggregate value over the purchase price proposed to be paid by Johnson & Johnson, and represents a premium of approximately 12% over the proposed Johnson & Johnson purchase price, based on Friday's closing price of Johnson & Johnson shares.  Upon consummation of the proposed transaction, based on Friday's closing price of our shares, Guidant shareholders would own approximately 36% of the combined company.  We believe that our current share price does not reflect the true value of our company, and that the stock component of our offer presents your shareholders with the opportunity for significant additional upside over and above the benefits that we believe would result from the proposed combination.
 
As reflected in the attached merger agreement, our offer is not subject to any financing condition.  Moreover, we have received the attached commitment letter from Bank of America, N.A. and Merrill Lynch & Co. for all the financing we need to consummate the transaction.  Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and Wachovia Bank, National Association have also committed to participate in the financing.
 
In our letter to you of December 5, we indicated a willingness to agree to specific divestitures in order to address potential antitrust issues that could be raised by the combination of our companies.  We have entered into a binding definitive agreement with Abbott, pursuant to which we have agreed to divest Guidant's vascular intervention and endovascular businesses, while agreeing to share rights to Guidant's drug eluting stent program.  We believe that the transaction with Abbott is sufficient to address such potential antitrust issues.
 
Our board of directors has unanimously approved the submission of our definitive offer as reflected in the signed merger agreement that is attached hereto and as otherwise contemplated by this letter.  In addition, holders of approximately 30% of Boston Scientific shares have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the proposed transaction.  We believe that our offer constitutes a "superior proposal" as contemplated by the terms of Guidant's amended merger agreement with Johnson & Johnson.
Our offer will remain open for acceptance by Guidant until the close of business on January 19, 2006.  Should you wish to accept our offer, please indicate as such by signing and returning a copy of the attached merger agreement by the close of business on January 19, 2006.
 
We believe that our offer presents a compelling opportunity for both our companies and look forward to your prompt response.

Exhibit 99.2
that it has executed a binding definitive agreement with Abbott (NYSE: ABT) under which Abbott will purchase Guidant Corporation's (NYSE: GDT) vascular intervention and endovascular businesses, assuming completion of Boston Scientific's proposed acquisition of Guidant (announced in a separate Boston Scientific press release issued today).
Natick, MA (January 8, 2006)  Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) announced today
 
As part of this agreement, Boston Scientific will share rights to Guidant's drug-eluting stent (DES) portfolio with Abbott, providing Boston Scientific a second DES platform.
 
Boston Scientific had announced its intention to divest Guidant's vascular intervention and endovascular businesses and to share rights to Guidant's DES portfolio in its initial proposal to acquire Guidant on December 5, 2005.  Boston Scientific believes that the execution of its agreement with Abbott will enable the Company to rapidly secure antitrust approval of the acquisition of Guidant.
 
Under the terms of the agreement with Abbott, Guidant's vascular intervention and endovascular businesses will be purchased by Abbott for a total consideration of $4.3 billion.  This amount includes an upfront payment of $3.8 billion in cash on or around the closing of Boston Scientific's acquisition of Guidant, a payment of $250 million upon U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of an everolimus-based DES product, and an additional payment of $250 million upon a similar approval in Japan.  These contingent payments are due if the requisite approvals are received anytime within 10 years of closing this transaction.
 
In addition to receiving the $3.8 billion in initial purchase price at or around the closing of the Guidant transaction, Abbott has agreed to provide to Boston Scientific a $700 million loan in the form of a five-year subordinated note bearing interest at 5.25 percent.  Accordingly, Boston Scientific will receive $4.5 billion in cash from Abbott on or around the closing date of the Guidant transaction.
 
Boston Scientific and Abbott have agreed that Abbott will supply Boston Scientific, on a private label basis, with Guidant DES products.  This interim supply agreement will facilitate a transitioning of the shared DES rights to Boston Scientific.  These rights include rights to intellectual property and technology transfers, sharing of regulatory and clinical trial assets and the rights to independently iterate, manufacture and commercialize DES technology.   Drug-eluting stents sold by Abbott will be separately branded, priced and marketed.
 
The transaction is subject to a limited number of closing conditions, including receipt of the required regulatory approvals.
 
In addition, sharing rights to Guidant's DES portfolio will enable Boston Scientific to offer both paclitaxel-eluting and everolimus-eluting stents to interventional cardiologists and their patients."
"Our agreement with Abbott to divest Guidant's vascular intervention and endovascular businesses demonstrates our commitment to address potential antitrust issues raised by our proposed acquisition of Guidant, and should enable us to complete the acquisition of Guidant quickly," said Jim Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific.  "
