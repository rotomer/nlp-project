(b)
above, the date such prepayment was designated to occur pursuant to the applicable
Prepayment Notice
) of the principal of such CP Rate Loan if such reduction, assignment or termination had not occurred or such
Prepayment Notice

CP Rate
means, with
respect to either Conduit for any CP Tranche Period, the
per annum
interest rate that, when applied to the outstanding principal balance of such Conduits CP Rate Loans for the actual number of days elapsed in such CP Tranche Period, would result in an amount of accrued interest equivalent to such Conduits CP Costs for such CP Tranche Period
