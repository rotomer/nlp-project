COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES
.
On January 8, 2007, Boston Scientific Corporation (the Company) announced a plan to reallocate its cardiac rhythm management (CRM) research and development resources to increase innovation, productivity and competitiveness, and to enhance the Company's ability to deliver new products to physicians and their patients.  The plan will result in a reduction of the Company's CRM workforce by approximately 500-600 employees during the first quarter of 2007.
  
The Company expects the plan to result in after-tax costs of approximately $70 million for one-time termination benefits, including change in control, severance and welfare benefit payments.   These payments will be made
 
principally in cash and substantially all the payments will be made during 2007.  The press release announcing the plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
