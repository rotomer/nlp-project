ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
   
On January 10, 2007, Boston Scientific Corporation (the Company) issued a press release announcing preliminary, unaudited net sales for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2006.  A copy of the release is furnished with this report as Exhibit 99.1.
 
ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
   
 
In the same press release, the Company announced that at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference on January 9, 2007, Larry Best, Chief Financial Officer, said he believes the drug-eluting stent market is going through a period of correction. He said that while he estimates current U.S. drug-eluting stent penetration rates may be less than 75 percent, he expects them to return to levels in excess of 80 percent.
 
During the Conference, slide 26 of the Companys presentation incorrectly presented for 2006 the mid-point of its previously announced range of worldwide drug-eluting stent revenue. The estimated mid-point should have been reflected as $2.4 billion as opposed to $2.3 billion.
 
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
 
ITEM 9.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant
 
to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
Natick, MA (January 10, 2007
) -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) today announced preliminary, unaudited net sales for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2006.
 
Preliminary net sales for the fourth quarter are estimated to be approximately $2.065 billion. Preliminary worldwide sales for the fourth quarter of the Companys TAXUS
paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent systems are estimated to be approximately $506 million, of which $329 million are estimated to be in the U.S. Preliminary worldwide sales for the fourth quarter of the Companys cardiac rhythm management (CRM) Group are estimated to be approximately $489 million, of which $356 million are estimated to be implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) sales.
 
Preliminary net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 are estimated to be approximately $7.821 billion. Preliminary worldwide sales for the full year 2006 of the Companys TAXUS
paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent systems are estimated to be approximately $2.358 billion, of which $1.561 billion are estimated to be in the U.S. Preliminary worldwide CRM sales, since the April 21, 2006 acquisition of Guidant, are estimated to be approximately $1.371 billion, of which $988 million are estimated to be ICD sales.
 
On a pro-forma basis for 2006 - as though the Company had acquired Guidant on January 1, 2006 - total preliminary Boston Scientific sales were approximately $8.533 billion, and worldwide CRM sales were approximately $2.026 billion of which $1.473 billion are estimated to be ICD sales.
 
We are pleased that we are delivering total sales toward the high end of the range we provided at our November 6 analyst meeting, said Jim Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific. We are also pleased that the CRM market appears to be growing again, and although we saw a decline in drug-eluting stent penetration and sales, we remain optimistic the market will recover over time.
 
At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference yesterday, Larry Best, Chief Financial Officer, said he believes the drug-eluting stent market is going through a period of correction. He said that while he estimates current U.S. drug-eluting stent penetration rates may be less than 75 percent, he expects them to return to levels in excess of 80 percent.
