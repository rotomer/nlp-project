    The corporation may also have offices at such other places, both within and without the State of Delaware, as the board of directors may from time to time determine or the business of the corporation may require.
Section 2.
Other Offices.
 
 
    An annual meeting of the stockholders shall be held for the purpose of electing Directors and conducting such other business as may properly come before the meeting. The date, time and place, within or without the State of Delaware, of the annual meeting shall be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.
Section 1.
Annual Meetings.
 
    Special meetings of stockholders may be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof. Special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board or the President, and shall be called within 10 days after receipt of the written request of the Board of Directors, pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the Whole Board (as defined below). Any such resolution shall be sent to the Chairman of the Board or the President and the Secretary of the corporation and shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. Business transacted at any special meeting is limited to the purposes stated in the notice. For the purposes of these By-Laws, the term Whole Board is defined as the total number of Directors which the corporation would have if there were no vacancies.
Section 2.
Special Meetings.
 
    Written or printed notice of every annual or special meeting of the stockholders, stating the place, date, time, and, in the case of special meetings, the purpose or purposes, of such meeting, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting. All such notices shall be delivered, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the Chairman of the Board or the President or the Board of Directors, and if mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the corporation, with postage prepaid. When a meeting is adjourned to another place, date or time, written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the place, date and time thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, written notice of the place, date and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given in conformity herewith. At any adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
Section 3.
Notice.
 
    The officer having charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall make, at least ten days before every meeting of the stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting arranged in alphabetical order, specifying the address of and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.
Section 4.
Stockholders List.
 
    The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. If a quorum is not present, the holders of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, and entitled to vote thereat, shall have the power, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of such shares, to
Section 5.
Quorum.
 
 
 
 
adjourn the meeting to another time and/or place, without notice other than announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment was taken, until a quorum shall be present or represented.
 
    At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (c) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholders notice must be delivered to or mailed to and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation, not less than 120 calendar days before the date of the Companys proxy statement released to shareholders in connection with the previous years annual meeting. However, if the Company did not hold an annual meeting the previous year, or if the date of the current years annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the date of the previous years meeting, then the deadline is a reasonable time before the Company begins to print and mail its proxy materials.
Section 6.
Notice of Stockholder Business.
 
A stockholders notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the corporations books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (c) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, and (d) any material interest of the stockholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in the By-Laws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at an annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6 of Article II.
 
The presiding officer of an annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with this Section 6 of Article II, and, if the presiding officer should so determine, the presiding officer shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
 
    The Board of Directors shall appoint inspectors of election to act as judges of the voting and to determine those entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or any adjournment thereof, in advance of such meeting, but if the Board of Directors fails to make such appointments or if an appointee fails to serve, the presiding officer of the meeting of stockholders may appoint substitute inspectors.
Section 7.
Inspectors.
 
    Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled at every meeting of the stockholders to one vote for each share of stock having voting power standing in the name of such stockholder on the books of the corporation on the record date for the meeting and such votes may be cast either in person or by written proxy. Every proxy must be duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the corporation. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the Secretary of the corporation. The vote upon any question brought before a meeting of the stockholders may be by voice vote, unless otherwise required by these By-Laws or unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or by proxy at such meeting shall so determine. Every vote taken by written ballot shall be counted by the inspectors of election. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock which has voting power present in person or represented by proxy and which has actually voted shall decide any question properly brought before such meeting, except the election or removal of Directors or as otherwise provided in these By-Laws, the Certificate of Incorporation or a Preferred Stock Designation or by applicable law. With respect to any election or questions required to be decided by any class of stock voting as a class, the vote of the holders of a majority of such class of stock present in person or by proxy and which actually voted shall decide any such election or question.
Section 8.
Voting.
 
    Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors prior to the meeting, the presiding officer of the meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and shall have the authority in his discretion to regulate the conduct of any such meeting, including, without limitation, by imposing restrictions on the persons (other than stockholders of the corporation or their duly appointed proxies) who may attend any such meeting of stockholders, by ascertaining whether any
Section 9.
Order of Business.
 
 
 
 
stockholder or his proxy may be excluded from any meeting of stockholders based upon any determination by the presiding officer, in his sole discretion, that any such person has unduly disrupted or is likely to disrupt the proceedings thereat, and by determining the circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask questions at any meeting of stockholders.
 
 
    Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nominations for the election of Directors may be made by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors or by any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of Directors generally. However, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of Directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as Directors at a meeting only if written notice of such stockholders intent to make such nomination or nominations has been given, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the corporation not later 120 calendar days before the date of the Companys proxy statement released to shareholders in connection with the previous years annual meeting. However, if the Company did not hold an annual meeting the previous year, or if the date of the current years annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the date of the previous years meeting, then the deadline is a reasonable time before the Company begins to print and mail its proxy materials.
Section 1.
Notification of Nominees.
 
If the nomination or nominations is for a meeting of stockholders other than a regularly scheduled annual meeting, the deadline is a reasonable time before the Company begins to print and mail its proxy material.
 
Each such notice shall set forth: (a) the name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated; (b) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice; (c) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder, (d) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board of Directors; and (e) the consent of each nominee to serve as a Director of the corporation if so elected.
 
    If a person is validly designated as a nominee in accordance with Section 1 of this Article III, and shall thereafter become unable or unwilling to stand for election to the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors or the stockholder who proposed such nominee, as the case may be, may designate a substitute nominee upon delivery, not fewer than five days prior to the date of the meeting for the election of such nominee, of a written notice to the Secretary setting forth such information regarding such substitute nominee as would have been required to be delivered to the Secretary pursuant to Section I of this Article III, had such substitute nominee been initially proposed as a nominee. Such notice shall include a signed consent to serve as a Director of the Corporation, if elected, of each substitute nomine.
Section 2.
Substitution of Nominees.
 
    If the presiding officer of the meeting for the election or Directors determines that a nomination for any candidate for election as a Director at such meeting was not made in accordance with the applicable provisions of these By-Laws, such person will not be eligible for election as a Director and such nomination shall be void; provided, however, that nothing in these By-Laws shall be deemed to limit any voting rights upon the occurrence of dividend arrearages provided to holders of Preferred Stock pursuant to the Preferred Stock Designation for any series of Preferred Stock.
Section 3.
Compliance with Procedures.
 
 
    The business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors, which may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

The directors shall be elected by plurality vote annually by the stockholders at their annual meeting or at any special meeting the notice of which specifies the election of directors as an item of business for such meeting; provided that each director serving a three-year term on the date of this amendment may serve out the entirety of his or her term.

At any annual meeting of the stockholders of the corporation or at any special meeting of the stockholders of the corporation, the notice of which shall state that the removal of a Director or Directors is among the purposes of the meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of Voting Stock (as defined below), voting together as a single class, may remove, with or without cause, such Director or Directors. For the purposes of these By-Laws, Voting Stock shall mean the outstanding shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors.

Section 2.
 
  To the extent that an officer of the corporation or person serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VI or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.

Such determination shall be made (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders.

Section 5.
 
  The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in other capacity while holding such office.
Section 6.
 
  The corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article VI.
Section 7.
 
  For purposes of this Article VI, references to the corporation shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors and officers so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director or officer of another corporation shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VI with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
Section 8.
 
  The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this section shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be an officer, employee or person serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

  If in any action, suit or other proceeding or investigation, a Director of the corporation is held not liable for monetary damages because that Director is relieved of personal liability under Article NINTH of the Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise, the Director shall be deemed to have met the standards of conduct set forth above and to be entitled to indemnification as provided above.
Section 11.
 
 
    Every holder of stock in the corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate, signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, (1) the president or a vice-president and (2) the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by him or her in the corporation. Where a certificate is signed (1) by a transfer agent or an assistant transfer agent other than the corporation or its employee or (2) by a registrar, other than the corporation or its employee, the signature of any such president, vice-president, treasurer, assistant treasurer, secretary, or assistant secretary may be facsimile. In case any officer or officers who have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used on, any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the corporation whether because of death, resignation or otherwise before such certificate or certificates have been delivered by the corporation, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile signature or signatures have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the corporation.
Section 1.
Form.
 
    The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate or certificates to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen, or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his or her legal representative, to give the corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
Section 2.
Lost Certificates.
 
    Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a date, not more than sixty nor less than ten days preceding the date of any meeting of stockholders, or the date for the payment of any dividend, or the date for the allotment of rights, or the date when any change or conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go into effect, or a date in connection with obtaining any consent, as a record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any such meeting, and any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any such dividend, or to any such allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights in respect to any such change, conversion, or exchange of capital stock, or to give such consent, and in such case such stockholders and only such stockholders as shall be stockholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to such notice of, and to vote at, such meeting and any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of such dividend, or to receive such allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, or to give such consent, as the case may be notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the books of the corporation after any such record date fixed as aforesaid. If no record date is fixed, the time for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. The time for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
Section 3.
Fixing a Record Date.
 
    The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and
Section 4.
Registered Stockholders.
 
 
 
 
shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of the other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of the State of Delaware.
 
 
    Dividends upon the capital stock of the corporation, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, if any, may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting, pursuant to law. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, or for such other purpose as the directors shall think in the best interest of the corporation, and the directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.
Section 1.
Dividends.
 
    All checks or demands for money and notes of the corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers or such other person or persons as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.
Section 2.

    The seal of the corporation shall be in the form of a circle and shall have inscribed thereon the name of the corporation, the year of its organization and the words Corporate Seal, Delaware. The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise.
Section 4.

    Voting securities in any other corporation held by the corporation shall be voted by the president, treasurer or any vice president, unless the Board of Directors specifically confers authority to vote with respect thereto, which may be general or confined to specific instances, upon some other person or officer. Any person authorized to vote securities shall have the power to appoint proxies, with general power of substitution.
Section 5.
Securities Owned By Corporation.
 
    No contract or transaction between the corporation and one or more of its Directors or officers, or between the corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association, or other organization in which one or more of its Directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the Director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the board of or committee thereof which authorized the contract or transaction, or solely because the votes of the Director or officer are counted for such purpose, provided that the material facts as to the relationship or interest of the Director or officer and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested Directors, even though the disinterested Directors be less than a quorum or provided that the contract or transaction is otherwise authorized in accordance with the laws of Delaware. Common or interested Directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a committee which authorizes the contract or transactions.
Section 6.
Conflict of Interest.
 
 
Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws may be amended or repealed at any regular meeting of the stockholders or at any special meeting thereof duly called for that purpose by a majority vote of the shares represented and entitled to vote at such meeting provided that in the notice of such special meeting notice of such purpose shall be given. Subject to the laws of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-Laws, the Board of Directors may by majority vote of those present at any meeting at which a quorum is present amend or repeal these By-Laws, or adopt such other By-Laws as in their judgment may be advisable for the regulation of the conduct of the affairs of the corporation.
