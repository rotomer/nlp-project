On November 19, 2007, we announced that an amended agreement had been reached to settle claims associated with a series of product communications issued by Guidant Corporation in 2005 and 2006. We acquired Guidant Corporation last year.  This agreement amends a prior agreement we reached in July 2007 to cover additional unanticipated claims.
Under the terms of the amended agreement, subject to certain conditions, we will pay a total of up to $240 million.  The agreement covers 8,550 patient claims, including all of those that have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota in a Multi-District Litigation, as well as other filed and unfiled claims throughout the United States.  As a result of the amendment, proceedings in Minnesota state court have, like the trials in the bellwether cases in the MDL, been stayed.
A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1.
