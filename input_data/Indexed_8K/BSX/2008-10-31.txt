This Plan shall be unfunded for tax purposes.  The Plan, as restated herein, is intended to comply with Code section 409A and shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with Code section 409A and the Treasury regulations and other interpretative guidance issued thereunder.  No amounts credited or vested under the Plan prior to January 1, 2005, pursuant to the terms of the Plan as then in effect, shall be grandfathered within the meaning of Code section 409A.

(a)
 
.  In connection with a Participants commencement of participation in the Plan during the course of a Plan Year, the Participant may make an irrevocable deferral election for Directors Fees in respect of services to be performed for the remainder of the Plan Year in which the Participant commences participation in the Plan not later than thirty (30) days after first becoming eligible, along with, to the extent consistent with section 409A of the Code, such other form or forms as the Committee deems necessary or desirable under the Plan. For such election to be valid, the Election Form must be completed and signed by the Participant, timely delivered to the

Committee (in accordance with the foregoing sentence) and accepted by the Committee.  A Director who already participates or is eligible to participate in (including, except to the extent otherwise provided in Treas. Reg.  1.409A-2(a)(7), a Director who has any entitlement, vested or unvested, to payments under) any other nonqualified deferred compensation plan that would be required to be aggregated with the Plan for purposes of Treas. Reg.  1.409A-1(c)(2) shall not be treated as eligible for the mid-year election rules of this Section 3.2 with respect to the Plan, even if he or she had never previously been eligible to participate in the Plan itself.
 
(b)
 
.  For each succeeding Plan Year, an irrevocable deferral election for that Plan Year, and such other elections as the Committee deems necessary or desirable under the Plan, shall be made by timely delivering to the Committee a new Election Form, in accordance with its rules and procedures; provided that such Election Form must be delivered not later than the last day of the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year in which the services to which the Directors Fees relate are to be performed. If no Election Form is timely delivered for a Plan Year, there shall be no Annual Deferral Amount for that Plan Year.

As of any date thereafter, the Participant shall be vested in any Common Stock equivalent unit credited to his or her Equity Common Stock Account Balance solely to the extent that he or she would have been vested as of such date in the specific equity-based award from which such Common Stock equivalent unit was converted, absent the conversion of such equity-based award into Common Stock equivalent units under this Section 3.4(b).

The determination of the existence of a Participants Unforeseeable Financial Emergency and the amount required to be distributed to meet the need created by the Unforeseeable Financial Emergency shall be made by the Committee, all in accordance with the rules of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(i)(3).  The payment of any amount under this Section 4.3 shall not be subject to the Deduction Limitation.

The Participant may change this election by submitting a new Election Form to the Committee that is accepted by the Committee in its sole discretion; he or she must irrevocably elect to postpone by a period of not fewer than five (5) years the year in which payment of his or her Moodys Rate Option Account Balance is to be made or to commence, in which case (unless there is an accelerated payment by reason of the Participants death under Section 5.4 or Article 6) payment shall be made or shall commence no later than 60 days following the last day of such subsequent year.  No such additional deferral election shall take effect until one year has elapsed from the date the new Election Form is accepted by the Committee.

A Participant, in connection with his or her commencement of participation in the Plan, shall elect on an Election Form whether his or her Beneficiary shall receive his or her Moodys Rate Option Account Balance as a Pre-Termination Survivor Benefit in the form of a lump sum or in equal monthly payments (the latter determined in accordance with Section 3.5 above) over a period of 60 or 120 months.  The Participant may change this election by submitting a new Election Form to the Committee that is accepted by the Committee in its sole discretion; no such change shall take effect until one year has elapsed from the date the new Election Form is accepted by the Committee. Despite the foregoing, if the Participants Account Balance at the time of his or her death is less than the applicable dollar amount in effect under Code section 402(g)(1)(B) at such time, payment of the Pre-Termination Survivor Benefit may be made, in the sole discretion of the Committee, in a lump sum; provided that such payment results in the termination and liquidation of the entirety of the Participants interest under the Plan, including all agreements, methods, programs, or other arrangements with respect to which deferrals of compensation are treated as having been deferred under a single nonqualified deferred compensation plan under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(c)(2).  Any Pre-Termination Survivor Benefit payable under this Section 6.2(b) shall be made, in the case of a lump sum payment, or shall commence, in the case of an installment payment, no later than 90 days after the date of the Participants death.

Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification.

(a)
 
.  If, for any reason, all or any portion of a Participants benefit under this Plan becomes taxable to the Participant prior to receipt, a Participant may petition the Committee for a distribution of that portion of his or her benefit that has become taxable.  Upon the grant of such a petition, which grant shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Company shall distribute to the Participant immediately available funds in an amount equal to the taxable portion of his or her benefit (which amount shall not exceed a Participants unpaid Account Balance under the Plan).  If the petition is granted, the tax liability distribution shall be made within 90 days of the date when the Participants petition is granted.  Such a distribution shall affect and reduce the benefits to be paid under this Plan.
In General

Acceleration of the payment of benefits under the Plan shall also be allowed at any time the Plan fails to meet the requirements of Code section 409A and the regulations issued thereunder, to the extent such acceleration is permitted under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(j)(4)(vii).  Any payment made based upon the acceleration for the failure to meet the requirements of Code section 409A and the regulations issued thereunder may not exceed the amount required to be included in income as a result of the failure to comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder.
