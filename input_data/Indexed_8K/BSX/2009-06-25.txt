Dear Ray:
On behalf of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are very pleased to confirm our offer of employment to you.  Your initial position of employment with Boston Scientific, commencing June 23, 2009 (the Commencement Date), will be in the part-time role of Senior Advisor, reporting to the Chairman of the Board of Directors.  Thereafter, effective no later than July 13, 2009, you will become the full-time President and Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific.  As part of this offer, we are recommending your nomination (subject to Board approval) as a member of Boston Scientifics Board of Directors and Executive Committee. We look forward to a productive and successful working relationship and to your formal acceptance of this offer of employment.
This letter, the enclosed Employee Agreement (attached as Appendix 1) and our Code of Conduct summarize our understanding of the terms of your employment and provide you the means to accept our offer as described.
COMPENSATION
Through annual and long-term programs, Boston Scientific's compensation programs provide our employees with significant compensation opportunities on a pay for performance basis.  The objective of these programs is to recognize and reward both individual and company performance.
  Within ten days following your becoming Chief Executive Officer, you will be paid a sign-on bonus of $1.5 million.
Sign-on Bonus:
  While you serve as Senior Advisor, you will be paid a base salary at the annualized rate of $600,000.  Base annualized gross salary for the position of President and Chief Executive Officer will be $1.2 million, currently payable in bi-weekly installments.  Your performance and compensation will generally be reviewed on an annual basis.  The Boston Scientific performance year currently runs from January 1 through December 31 of each year.
Base Salary:
 
The Performance Incentive Plan provides employees with the opportunity for a variable financial incentive in recognition of individual and company performance in a given year.  You are eligible to participate in the annual Performance Incentive Plan beginning this year and you will be eligible to receive a prorated bonus amount for 2009.  Per the current plan, your annual target incentive is 120% of base salary.  Your actual award will be based on your achievement of individual goals and the company's achievement of corporate performance goals.  With respect to your bonus for 2009, 100% will be paid in the form of Deferred Stock Units under Boston Scientifics 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (DSUs), valued at the closing price of our common stock on the date on which your bonus is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Boston Scientific Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee).  These DSUs will be fully vested upon issuance and payable on the fourth anniversary of issuance.  With respect to your bonus for each subsequent year, you will be given the opportunity to elect, no later than May 31 of the year for which the bonus is paid (but in no event after the time in which the bonus has become readily ascertainable within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) the portion of the bonus that will be paid in cash and the portion that will be paid in DSUs.  Under the current plan, you must be an active employee on December 31 of the then current year to be eligible for payment. A copy of the 2009 Performance Incentive Plan has already been provided to you.
Performance Incentive Plan:  
 
  As part of this offer of employment, the Compensation Committee has determined that you be granted on the Commencement Date, (a) one million shares of restricted DSUs (Restricted DSUs), and (b) non-qualified options to purchase 3.4 million shares of Boston Scientific common stock (1.4 million shares from the 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan and two million shares from the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan).  In addition, you will be granted a non-qualified option to acquire 600,000 shares of Boston Scientific common stock in 2010 on the date that long-term incentive awards are made to senior executives of Boston Scientific generally.  Further, 1.250 million DSUs (the Performance Shares) will be granted to you on the Commencement Date, which Performance Shares will be earned
Equity:
and settled in shares of our common stock in 250,000 increments on each of the dates (occurring prior to December 31, 2012)on whichwhile you remain employed by Boston Scientific, Boston Scientific common stocks average closing price for any ten consecutive trading days equals or exceeds $20.00, $22.50, $25.00, $27.50 and $30.00.  In applying the foregoing trading price thresholds, the relevant Performance Shares will be earned and settled only on the first occasion on which the corresponding ten-day price target is attained, but if a higher price target is attained before one or more lower price targets have been attained, not only the Performance Shares corresponding to such higher target, but also those corresponding to such previously unattained lower targets, shall be earned and settled.  (By way of illustration, but not limitation, if as of a given date Boston Scientific common stocks average closing price for the previous ten consecutive trading days equals $27.50, without the $20.00, $22.50 or $25.00 targets previously having been attained, one million Performance Shares will be earned and settled as of such date.)  Any Performance Shares that have not been earned by December 31, 2012 shall be forfeited.  Our Long Term Incentive Plans are designed to share the rewards of the business with individuals who most significantly contribute to the achievement of the companys strategic and operating goals.  Except for the awards specifically provided for herein, no additional grants of equity-based awards are expected to be made to you prior to the third anniversary of the Commencement Date.
 
,
.  Each tranche of Restricted DSUs will be payable (through delivery of unrestricted shares of Boston Scientific common stock) on the December 31 of the year in which such Restricted DSUs vest.  One-third of the Restricted DSUs will vest on the first anniversary of the Commencement Date, and thereafter on each monthly anniversary of such date 1/36 of the Restricted DSUs will vest until the Restricted DSUs are fully vested on the third anniversary of grant, in each case contingent on your continued employment through such date.  If you are involuntarily terminated (except for Cause), all the Restricted DSUs will vest in full.  In all other respects the Restricted DSUs will be subject to the terms of the applicable Long-Term Incentive Plan and Restricted DSU Award Agreement, a form of which has been provided to you.  Cause is defined for purposes of every aspect of this letter to mean:  (a) conduct constituting a material act of misconduct in connection with the performance of your duties; or (b) criminal or civil conviction, a plea of nolo contendere or conduct that would reasonably be expected to result in material injury to the reputation of Boston Scientific if you were retained in your position with Boston Scientific.  In addition, in accordance with the applicable Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Restricted DSUs will vest in full and become immediately payable upon your Disability, death or a Change in Control of Boston Scientific (as those terms are defined in the applicable Long-Term Incentive Plan).
Restricted DSUs
th
.  The option grants will provide you with the opportunity to purchase shares of Boston Scientific common stock.  The grant date and exercise price per share for the initial option grant will be set on the Commencement Date, with the exercise price per share for the initial option grant being the closing price of Boston Scientific common stock on the Commencement Date.  The 2010 option grant will have an exercise price per share equal to the closing price of Boston Scientific common stock on the date of grant.  The initial option grant and the 2010 option grant each will vest as to one quarter of the shares subject thereto on each of the first four anniversaries of grant until the option is fully vested on the fourth anniversary of grant, in each case contingent on your continued employment through such date.  The options may be exercised on a net exercise basis, with shares withheld to pay the exercise price and applicable taxes.  The options will expire on the 10 anniversary of the grant date.  In all other respects the option grants will be subject to the provisions of the applicable Long Term Incentive Plan and Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement, a form of which has been provided to you.  If you are involuntarily terminated (except for Cause) the options will vest in full.  In addition, in accordance with the applicable Long Term Incentive Plan, your unvested stock options will accelerate upon your Disability, Retirement, death or a Change in Control of Boston Scientific (as those terms are defined in the applicable Long Term Incentive Plan) and remain exercisable until the expiration of the stated term of the stock option.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Natick, MA (June 25, 2009)  Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) announced today that President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jim Tobin will retire from the Company, and that its board of directors has appointed Ray Elliott the new President and CEO, effective July 13.
Ten years ago this month, I began my tenure as CEO of Boston Scientific, and two months from now, I will turn 65, said Tobin.  Over the course of the past decade, we have built a stronger, more diversified company that is well positioned for the future.  We have achieved this due largely to the support of our employees, customers and investors, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them.  Now is an appropriate time for me to turn over the leadership of the Company to Ray Elliott, our new CEO.  Ray is an outstanding choice, and he has my full and enthusiastic support.  We will have a smooth transition, which will culminate with Ray taking over next month.
The board accepts Jims decision to retire with understanding and enormous gratitude, said Pete Nicholas, Chairman of the Board of Boston Scientific.  Jim led Boston Scientific through a period of tremendous growth and diversification that transformed the Company.  Thanks to his leadership and the efforts of thousands of Boston Scientific employees, our Company has strengthened its position as a worldwide leader in less-invasive medicine.  More important, while Jim has been CEO, Boston Scientific has helped improve the lives of millions of patients.  On behalf of the board, I would like to recognize and thank Jim for these and so many other accomplishments.
Elliott, 59, has more than 35 years of experience leading health care and consumer products companies.  He led the orthopedics company Zimmer Holdings Inc. for 10 years, joining the company as President and rising to become Chairman, President and CEO.  Prior to joining Zimmer, he served as President and CEO of Cybex International Inc., a medical rehabilitation and cardiovascular products company.  He has also served as President and Chairman of various divisions of Southam Inc., a communications group, and as Group President of the food and beverage company John Labatt Ltd.  He began his career in the health care industry with American Hospital Supply Corp.  now Baxter International Inc.  where he served for 15 years in sales, marketing, operations, business development and general management positions, leading to his appointment as President of all the Far East divisions, based in Tokyo.  He has also served on a number of boards, including AdvaMed, where he was chair of its orthopedics sector.  He was a member of the Boston Scientific board of directors from
 
2007 until earlier this year.  In addition to serving as President and CEO of Boston Scientific, he will rejoin the board.  He holds a bachelors degree from the University of Western Ontario, Canada.
During Elliotts leadership of Zimmer, sales and market capitalization quadrupled.  Sales increased from approximately $1 billion in 1997 to approximately $4 billion in 2007.   Elliott oversaw taking Zimmer public in 2001, with an initial market capitalization of approximately $5 billion.  At the time of his departure in 2007, the companys market capitalization was more than $20 billion.  In 2005 he was named Best CEO in America for Health Care (Medical Supplies and Devices), by Institutional Investor magazine.
We are delighted that Ray will be joining us as only the third CEO of Boston Scientific, said Nicholas.  His long and proven track record in leadership positions has prepared him well for this role.  Ray is an extremely capable leader with extensive experience running global health care companies.   We have gotten to know Ray well as a leader and colleague in the industry, as well as from his service on our board.  We are confident he offers the right combination of experience, results and talents for Boston Scientific going forward.
As chair of the search committee, I had the opportunity to review a number of strong candidates, and Ray stood out convincingly as our top choice, said Ernest Mario, Ph.D., a member of the Companys board of directors.  His experience and success leading large, complex, international companies -- coupled with his specific expertise in medical devices-- made him the clear selection to be Boston Scientifics new CEO.   We are very pleased that Ray will be assuming the leadership of the Company.
Its an honor to follow Pete and Jim as the CEO of Boston Scientific, a company with great products and technologies, a rich pipeline creating substantial future growth potential, and of course, outstanding people, said Elliott.  I look forward to leading the Boston Scientific team and building on the impressive tradition of delivering innovative medical solutions to patients and physicians.  I am committed, as always, to creating value for them, our employees and our shareholders.
Mr. Tobin and Mr. Elliott will host an investor conference call at 9:00 a.m. (ET) today. The Company will webcast the call to all interested parties through its website: www.bostonscientific.com. Please see the website for details on how to access the webcast. The webcast will be available for one year on the Boston Scientific website.
