EXHIBIT 99.1
 
Natick, MA (July 20, 2009) -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009, as well as guidance for net sales and earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter and full year 2009. 
Second quarter highlights (Sales growth rates are constant currency):
I am excited about joining the Boston Scientific team and to help report a very good quarter, said Ray Elliott, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific. We delivered sales and earnings at the high end of our guidance range with almost all businesses and regions reporting solid results.  The performance of our two largest businesses was particularly impressive, with Cardiovascular achieving mid-teens growth in DES sales and CRM recording its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the U.S.
Net sales for the second quarter of 2009 were $2.074 billion, as compared to net sales of $2.024 billion for the second quarter of 2008, which included sales from divested businesses

of $19 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, net sales increased seven percent over the prior period.
Worldwide sales of the Companys CRM products for the second quarter  on a reported basis  were as follows:
 
Worldwide sales of the Companys coronary stent systems for the second quarter  on a reported basis  were as follows:
 
Reported net income for the second quarter of 2009 was $158 million, or $0.10 per share. Reported results included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and restructuring-related charges; discrete tax items and amortization expense (after-tax) of $139 million, or $0.10 per share, which consisted of:
Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2009, excluding these charges, was $297 million, or $0.20 per share.
Reported net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $98 million, or $0.07 per share.  Reported results included acquisition-, divestiture-, and restructuring-related charges and amortization expense (after-tax) of $206 million, or $0.13 per share.  Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2008, excluding these charges, was $304 million, or $0.20 per share.

We were also encouraged during the quarter by positive outcomes from three important trials  MADIT-CRT, MADIT II and SYNTAX  all of which provided additional evidence of the effectiveness of our products, said Elliott.  New products accounted for more than 40 percent of our sales this quarter, and we continue to bring a wide range of innovations to market.  We recently received FDA approval for the TAXUS Libert Atom Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent System, the TAXUS Libert Long Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent System and an expanded indication for the SpyScope Access and Delivery Catheter, as well as CE Mark for the ENDOTAK RELIANCE 4-SITE Defibrillation Lead System and the LATITUDE Patient Management System.  These approvals position us well for the remainder of the year and, perhaps more important, provide a springboard into 2010.
 
Guidance for Third Quarter and Full Year 2009
The Company estimates net sales for the third quarter of 2009 of between $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion. Adjusted earnings, excluding intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, litigation- and restructuring-related charges; and amortization expense, are estimated to range between $0.17 and $0.21 per share. The Company estimates net income on a GAAP basis of between $0.08 and $0.13 per share.
The Company has updated its net sales estimate for the full year of 2009 to between $8.1 billion and $8.4 billion. The Company expects adjusted earnings, excluding intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, litigation- and restructuring-related charges; discrete tax items, and amortization expense, for the full year of between $0.82 and $0.86 per share. The Company expects net income on a GAAP basis of between $0.47 and $0.53 per share.
Boston Scientific officials will be discussing these results with analysts on a conference call at 8:00 a.m. (ET) Tuesday, July 21, 2009. The Company will webcast the call to all interested parties through its website: www.bostonscientific.com. Please see the website for details on how to access the webcast.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement Boston Scientifics condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis; the Company discloses certain non-GAAP measures that exclude certain amounts, including non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
The GAAP measure most comparable to non-GAAP net income is GAAP net income and the GAAP measure most comparable to non-GAAP net income per share is GAAP net income per share. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measure are included in the accompanying schedules.
To calculate regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange, the Company converts actual current-period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign exchange rates. The GAAP measure most comparable to this non-GAAP measure is growth rate percentages based on GAAP revenue. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the corresponding GAAP measure is included in the accompanying schedules.
Use and Economic Substance of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Used by Boston Scientific
Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in the Companys business, to assess its performance relative to its competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures to further its understanding of the performance of the Companys operating segments. The adjustments excluded from the Companys non-GAAP measures are consistent with those excluded from its reportable segments measure of profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to the Companys chief operating decision maker and are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.
The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of its non-GAAP measures for the six months ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 and for the forecasted three month period ending September 30, 2009 and full year ending December 31, 2009, as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:

Material Limitations Associated with the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange may have limitations as analytical tools, and these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for GAAP financial measures. Some of the limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures are:
Compensation for Limitations Associated with Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Boston Scientific compensates for the limitations on its non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon its GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Companys performance. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the Company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the Companys performance.
The Company provides detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying schedules, and Boston Scientific encourages investors to review these reconciliations.
Usefulness of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Investors
The Company believes that presenting non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange in addition to the related GAAP measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by
 
 
16
 
Boston Scientific management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see Boston Scientifics results through the eyes of management. The Company further believes that providing this information better enables Boston Scientifics investors to understand the Companys operating performance and to evaluate the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.
