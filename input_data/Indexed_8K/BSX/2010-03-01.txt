Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
5.02(b): At a meeting of our Board of Directors held on February 23, 2010, Senator Warren B. Rudman and John E. Pepper announced their intention not to stand for re-election at our 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and to retire from our Board at that time. 5.02(c): On February 23, 2010, the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") approved a long-term equity incentive award for Jeffrey D. Capello having an aggregate value of $1,250,000 in consideration of the increased responsibilities to be assumed by him in his new position as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. The award consists of 25% performance share units, 25% deferred stock units and 50% non-qualified stock options, all of which were granted as of the close of business on February 23, 2010. Mr. Capellos annual base salary is $575,000, not $600,000 as reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated as of February 6, 2010. 5.02(e): On February 23, 2010, the Compensation Committee also approved certain relocation benefits for Fredericus A. Colen in connection with his new role as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of the Company. The Company will absorb a third of Mr. Colens gross loss on the sale of his home, not to exceed a gross loss of $1,000,000. The Company will also absorb the cost of personal goods shipments to a second location. As is the practice under our global relocation programs, Mr. Colen will receive a tax gross-up benefit with regard to these payments.
