EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
Natick, MA (April 26, 2010) -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010, as well as guidance for net sales and earnings per share (EPS) for the second quarter and full year 2010. 
First quarter highlights (sales growth rates are at constant currency):
It was a challenging quarter including a settlement to resolve long-standing litigation, and the CRM ship hold and product removal actions, said Ray Elliott, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific.  However, the return of COGNIS and TELIGEN to the U.S. market -- coupled with exceptional cash flow and a strong cadence from our new product pipeline -- were positive factors.

The Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) ship hold and product removal actions created an adverse impact on both sales and earnings within the first quarter.  The combination of the expected financial impact of these actions -- coupled with slower expected market growth -- caused a $1.8 billion write-down of goodwill associated with the Companys U.S. CRM business unit, which it acquired through the Guidant acquisition. This is a non-cash charge that has no impact on the Companys debt covenants.  The amount of the charge is subject to finalization during the second quarter of 2010.
Net sales for the first quarter of 2010 were $1.960 billion, as compared to net sales of $2.010 billion for the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and net sales from divested businesses, net sales decreased six percent as compared to the prior period.
Worldwide CRM net sales for the first quarter  on a reported basis  were as follows:
 
 
 
Worldwide coronary stent system net sales for the first quarter  on a reported basis  were as follows:
 
 
Reported net loss for the first quarter of 2010 was $1.589 billion, or $1.05 per share. Reported results included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition- and restructuring-related net credits; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $1.840 billion, or $1.21 per share, which consisted of:

Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2010, excluding these net charges, was $251 million, or $0.16 per share.
Reported net loss for the first quarter of 2009 was $13 million, or $0.01 per share. Reported results included acquisition-, divestiture-, restructuring- and litigation-related net charges; discrete tax benefits, and amortization expense (after-tax) of $302 million, or $0.20 per share. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2009, excluding these net charges, was $289 million, or $0.19 per share.
Guidance for Second Quarter and Full Year 2010
The Company estimates net sales for the second quarter of 2010 of between $1.825 billion and $1.925 billion. Adjusted earnings, excluding restructuring and restructuring-related costs and amortization expense, are estimated to range between $0.06 and $0.10 per share. The Company estimates results on a GAAP basis of between a loss of $0.03 and income of $0.02 per share.
As a result of the ship hold and product removal actions involving the Companys ICDs and CRT-Ds during the quarter, the Company is revising estimates for the full year ending December 31, 2010. The Company now estimates net sales for the full year 2010 of between $7.6 billion and $8.0 billion. Adjusted earnings, excluding goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related credits, restructuring and restructuring-related costs, and amortization expense, are estimated to range between $0.50 and $0.60 per share. The Company now estimates a net loss on a GAAP basis of between $1.00 and $0.88 per share.
Boston Scientific officials will be discussing these results with analysts on a conference call at 8:00 a.m. (ET) Tuesday, April 27. The Company will webcast the call to all interested parties through its website: www.bostonscientific.com. Please see the website for details on how to access the webcast. The webcast will be available for one year on the Boston Scientific website.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement Boston Scientifics condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis; the Company discloses certain non-GAAP measures that exclude certain amounts, including non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
The GAAP measure most comparable to non-GAAP net income is GAAP net income and the GAAP measure most comparable to non-GAAP net income per share is GAAP net income per share. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measure are included in the accompanying schedules.
To calculate regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange, the Company converts actual current-period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign exchange rates. The GAAP measure most comparable to this non-GAAP measure is growth rate percentages based on GAAP revenue. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the corresponding GAAP measure is included in the accompanying schedules.
Use and Economic Substance of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Used by Boston Scientific
Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in the Companys business, to assess its performance relative to its competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures to further its understanding of the performance of the Companys operating segments. The adjustments excluded from the Companys non-GAAP measures are consistent with those excluded from its reportable segments measure of profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to the Companys chief operating decision maker and are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.
The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of its non-GAAP measures for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 and for the forecasted three month period ending June 30, 2010 and full year ending December 31, 2010, as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:

Material Limitations Associated with the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange may have limitations as analytical tools, and these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for GAAP financial measures. Some of the limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures are:
Compensation for Limitations Associated with Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Boston Scientific compensates for the limitations on its non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon its GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Companys performance. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the Company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the Companys performance.
The Company provides detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying schedules, and Boston Scientific encourages investors to review these reconciliations.
Usefulness of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Investors
The Company believes that presenting non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange in addition to the related GAAP measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by Boston Scientific management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see Boston Scientifics results through the eyes of management. The Company further believes that providing this information better enables Boston Scientifics investors to understand the Companys operating performance and to evaluate the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.
