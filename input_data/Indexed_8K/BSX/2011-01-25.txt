ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.
 
On January 12, 2011, the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota (the Court) accepted Guidant LLC (Guidant)'s plea agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) related to product advisories issued by Guidant in 2005. The plea agreement resolves the DOJ criminal investigation that began prior to Boston Scientific's 2006 acquisition of Guidant. In November 2009, Guidant agreed to plead to two misdemeanor charges related to the failure to include information in reports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and Boston Scientific Corporation (the Company) agreed to pay $296 million on behalf of Guidant.
 
In accepting the plea agreement, the Court placed Guidant on probation for three years, during which time Guidant will, among other things, provide the probation office with certain reports on its operations. On a yearly basis the Court will review whether it should grant Guidant an early discharge from probation. In addition, the Company voluntarily committed to contribute a total of $15 million to its Close the Gap program and Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education over the next three years.
In accordance with the plea agreement, the Company is required to pay the $296 million of fines and forfeitures within 10 business days of the Court's acceptance of the plea agreement.
