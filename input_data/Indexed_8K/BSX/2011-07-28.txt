RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On July 28, 2011, Boston Scientific Corporation issued a press release announcing financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011. A copy of the release is furnished with this report as Exhibit 99.1.
The information contained in Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and Exhibit 99.1 shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
ITEM 2.05. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES.
On July 26, 2011, the Board of Directors of Boston Scientific Corporation (the Company) approved, and the Company committed to, a 2011 restructuring program (the Program), designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies, increase competitiveness and support new investments, thereby increasing shareholder value. The Company estimates that the Program will reduce annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $225 million to $275 million exiting 2013, a portion of which will be reinvested in targeted areas necessary for future growth, including priority growth initiatives and emerging markets initiatives. Key activities under the Program, of which the Company's Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) Initiative and components of the Emerging Markets Initiative (EMI) are a part, include standardizing and automating certain processes and activities; relocating select administrative and functional activities; rationalizing organizational reporting structures; and leveraging preferred vendors. Among these efforts, the Company is expanding its ability to deliver best-in-class global shared services for certain functions and divisions at several locations in emerging markets. This action will enable Boston Scientific to grow its global commercial presence in key geographies and take advantage of many cost-reducing and productivity-enhancing opportunities. In addition, Boston Scientific is undertaking efforts to streamline various corporate functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align corporate resources to its key business strategies.
These activities will start to be initiated in the third quarter of 2011 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2013. The Company anticipates the reduction of 1,200 to 1,400 positions worldwide through a combination of employee attrition and targeted headcount reductions as the Program is implemented. Plans detailing specific employee impacts will be developed for each affected region and business, and the Company will consult in due course with relevant employee representative bodies, where required under local laws.
The Company estimates that the implementation of the Program will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $155 million to $210 million, and that approximately $150 million to $200 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays. The following table provides a summary of the Company's estimates of costs associated with the Program by major type of cost:
(1)     Consists primarily of consultant fees and contractual cancellations.
(2)     Comprised of other costs directly related to the restructuring program, including program management, accelerated depreciation, retention and infrastructure-related costs.
The Company estimates that during the third quarter of 2011, it will record approximately $10 million of restructuring charges associated with the Program. The Company will record the remaining expenses throughout the duration of the Program when it identifies with more specificity the job classifications, functions and locations of the remaining head count to be eliminated and as other Program-related expenses are incurred. 
ITEM 8.01.
    
OTHER EVENTS.
On July 28, 2011, the Company issued a press release announcing that its Board of Directors has approved a new shareholder distribution program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of its common stock in addition to the re-approval of the approximately 37 million shares remaining under an existing share repurchase program. A copy of the release is filed with this report as Exhibit 99.2.

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC SECOND QUARTER RESULTS EXCEED CONSENSUS SALES AND EPS; FULL-YEAR GUIDANCE RAISED
Company also announces new share repurchase, China investment and restructuring program
Natick, MA (July 28, 2011) -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) today announces financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011, as well as net sales and earnings per share (EPS) guidance for the third quarter and updated guidance for the full year 2011.  The Company exceeded its EPS guidance range for the quarter and is raising EPS guidance for the remainder of the year.
Delivering strong execution of its POWER business strategy, the Company also announces the prepayment of the remaining $750 million of its term loan borrowings, which reduced its gross debt to $4.2 billion, consistent with the target capital structure, with no further debt maturities until 2014; a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program; and a productivity-enhancing restructuring program as anticipated during the Company's Investor Day held in November 2010. Yesterday, the Company announced an additional $150 million investment in China to drive growth and increase market share through local manufacturing, physician training and an expanded commercial footprint.
Second quarter and other highlights:
   
Our POWER strategy is gaining traction and beginning to deliver tangible results, stated Ray Elliott, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific Corporation. In addition to solid second quarter financial results, we have now announced the prepayment of our remaining term loan borrowings, a share buyback program, a productivity-focused restructuring program and an additional investment in China, all of which are key steps on the path to achieving our goals. That's great news for our employees, shareholders and customers! We remain confident that Boston Scientific is POWERed for long term, sustainable growth.
Net sales for the second quarter of 2011 were $1.975 billion, as compared to net sales of $1.928 billion for the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 2 percent. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from divested businesses, net sales remained flat as compared to the prior period.
 
Worldwide net sales for the second quarter - on a constant currency and as reported basis - were as follows:
 
On a GAAP basis, net income for the second quarter of 2011 was $146 million, or $0.10 per share. These results included intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, and restructuring-related charges; and amortization expense, totaling $116 million, or $0.07 per share, which consisted primarily of:
 
Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2011, excluding these net charges, was $262 million, or $0.17 per share.
 
On a GAAP basis, net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $98 million, or $0.06 per share. Reported results included goodwill impairment-related credits; restructuring-related charges; and amortization expense (after-tax) totaling $92 million, or $0.06 per share. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2010, excluding these net charges, was $190 million, or $0.12 per share.
 
Restructuring Program
Demonstrating further progress on its POWER strategy, Boston Scientific also announces a restructuring program designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies, increase competitiveness and support new investments, thereby increasing shareholder value. Key activities under the program, of which
the Company's Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) Initiative and components of the Emerging Markets Initiative (EMI) are a part, include standardizing and automating certain processes and activities; relocating select administrative and functional activities; rationalizing organizational reporting structures; leveraging preferred vendors, and taking other actions aimed at increasing overall productivity.
The Company estimates the program will reduce annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $225 million to $275 million exiting 2013, a portion of which will be reinvested in targeted areas necessary for future growth, including the previously announced Priority Growth Initiatives (PGI) and EMI.
Program activities will start to be initiated in the third quarter of 2011 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2013. The Company anticipates the reduction of 1,200 to 1,400 positions worldwide through a combination of employee attrition and targeted headcount reductions as the program is implemented. Plans detailing specific employee impacts will be developed for each affected region and business, and the Company will consult in due course with relevant employee representative bodies, where required under local laws.
The Company estimates the program will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $155 million to $210 million, and that approximately $150 million to $200 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays.
The Company anticipates that during the third quarter of 2011, it will record approximately $10 million of restructuring charges associated with the program.  The Company will record the remaining expenses throughout the duration of the program when it identifies with more specificity the head count to be eliminated and as other program-related expenses are incurred. 
Guidance for Third Quarter and Full Year 2011
 
The Company estimates net sales for the third quarter of 2011 in a range of $1.870 billion to $1.970 billion. Compared to net sales for the third quarter of 2010, this range assumes a $40 million negative impact from the divestiture of the Company's former Neurovascular business. The Company estimates earnings on a GAAP basis in a range of $0.03 to $0.08 per share. Adjusted earnings, excluding acquisition-, divestiture- and restructuring-related net charges and amortization expense, are estimated in a range of $0.11 to $0.14 per share. Recent acquisitions are expected to dilute third quarter 2011 adjusted earnings by approximately $0.01 per share as compared to the prior year, and the divestiture of the Neurovascular business is expected to dilute third quarter 2011 adjusted earnings by $0.01 per share.
 
The Company now estimates net sales for the full year 2011 in a range of $7.675 billion to $7.875 billion. Compared to full year 2010 net sales, this range now assumes a $201 million negative impact from the divestiture of the Neurovascular business. Recent acquisitions are not expected to contribute to 2011 sales. The Company now estimates earnings on a GAAP basis in a range of $0.22 to $0.30 per share for the full year 2011. Adjusted earnings, excluding goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture, and restructuring-related net credits; discrete tax items and amortization expense, are being raised from previous guidance of $0.58 to $0.68 per share to an estimated range of $0.64 to $0.70 per share for the full year 2011.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement Boston Scientific's consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, the Company discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and adjusted free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
 
The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income per share. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted free cash flow is cash generated from operations. To calculate regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company converts actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non-GAAP financial measure is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the accompanying schedules.
 
Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in the Company's business, to assess its performance relative to its competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of the Company's operating segments. The adjustments excluded from the Company's non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from its reportable segments' measure of profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to the Company's chief operating decision maker and are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.
 
The Company believes that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and adjusted free cash flow in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by Boston Scientific management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see Boston Scientific's results through the eyes of management. The Company further believes that providing this information better enables Boston Scientific's investors to understand the Company's operating performance and to evaluate the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.
 
The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 and for the forecasted three month period ending September 30, 2011 and full year ending December 31, 2011, as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share
Regional and Divisional Revenue Growth Rates Excluding the Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
 
Adjusted Free Cash Flow
Adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and adjusted free cash flow are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than Boston Scientific does, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
 

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC ANNOUNCES $1.0B SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
Natick, MA (July 28, 2011) -- Boston Scientific Corporation's (NYSE: BSX) Board of Directors has approved a new program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of its common stock and re-approving the approximately 37 million shares remaining under an existing share repurchase program.
This repurchase program reflects our confidence in the strength of the Company's long-term business prospects, earnings growth potential and our ability to generate strong cash flow, said Ray Elliott, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific. Having reduced our gross debt to $4.2 billion, which is consistent with our targeted capital structure, we believe this new program provides us with added flexibility in our commitment to delivering value to shareholders.
Any share repurchases are at the Company's discretion, subject to applicable law, market conditions, stock price and other factors.
