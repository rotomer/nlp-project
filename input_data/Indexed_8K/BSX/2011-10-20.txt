BOSTON SCIENTIFIC EXCEEDS THIRD QUARTER EPS GUIDANCE, REPURCHASES 30 MILLION SHARES
Natick, MA (October 20, 2011) -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) announces financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2011, as well as updated sales and earnings per share (EPS) guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. 
Third quarter and other highlights:
 
Boston Scientific's earnings performance remains strong, despite very challenging global economic and end-market conditions that adversely impacted revenue, stated Hank Kucheman, Chief Executive Officer of Boston Scientific Corporation. The execution of the Company's POWER strategy is the right top priority for the entire leadership team.
Sales for the third quarter of 2011 were $1.874 billion, as compared to sales of $1.916 billion for the third quarter of 2010, a decrease of 2 percent. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales from divested businesses, sales decreased 3 percent as compared to the prior period.
 
Worldwide sales for the third quarter - on a constant currency and as reported basis - were as follows:
On a GAAP basis, net income for the third quarter of 2011 was $142 million, or $0.09 per share. These results included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related charges, divestiture-related net credits, restructuring-related charges, discrete tax benefits and amortization expense totaling $81 million, or $0.06 per share, which consisted of:
 
Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2011, excluding these net charges, was $223 million, or $0.15 per share.
 
On a GAAP basis, net income for the third quarter of 2010 was $190 million, or $0.12 per share. Reported results included intangible asset impairment charges, restructuring-related charges, discrete tax items, and amortization expense (after-tax) totaling $106 million, or $0.07 per share. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2010, excluding these net charges, was $296 million, or $0.19 per share.
 
Guidance for Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011
 
The Company estimates sales for the fourth quarter of 2011 in a range of $1.850 to $1.950 billion.  Compared
to sales for the fourth quarter of 2010, this range assumes a $64 million negative impact from the divestiture of the Neurovascular business. Recent acquisitions are not expected to contribute significantly to fourth quarter sales.  The Company estimates earnings on a GAAP basis in a range of $0.05 to $0.11 per share. Adjusted earnings, excluding restructuring-related net charges and amortization expense, are estimated in a range of $0.13 to $0.16 per share. Recent acquisitions are expected to dilute fourth quarter 2011 adjusted earnings by approximately $0.01 per share as compared to the prior year, and the divestiture of the Neurovascular business is expected to dilute fourth quarter 2011 adjusted earnings by $0.01 per share.
 
The Company now estimates sales for the full year 2011 in a range of $7.624 to $7.724 billion.  Compared to full year 2010 sales, this range now assumes a $204 million negative impact from the divestiture of the Neurovascular business.  Recent acquisitions are not expected to contribute significantly to 2011 sales.  The Company now estimates earnings on a GAAP basis in a range of $0.27 to $0.33 per share. Adjusted earnings, excluding goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, and restructuring-related net credits; discrete tax items; and amortization expense, are being updated from previous guidance of $0.64 to $0.70 per share to an estimated range of $0.67 to $0.70 per share. Recent acquisitions are expected to dilute full year 2011 adjusted earnings by approximately $0.04 per share as compared to the prior year, and the divestiture of the Neurovascular business is expected to dilute full year 2011 adjusted earnings by $0.04 per share.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement Boston Scientific's consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, the Company discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
 
The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income per share. To calculate regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company converts actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non-GAAP financial measure is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the accompanying schedules.
 
Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in the Company's business, to assess its performance relative to its competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of the Company's operating segments. The adjustments excluded from the Company's non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from its reportable segments' measure of profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to the Company's chief operating decision maker and are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.
 
The Company believes that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by Boston Scientific management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see Boston Scientific's results through the eyes of management. The Company further believes that providing this information assists Boston Scientific's investors in understanding the Company's operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.
 
The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 and for the forecasted three month and full year periods ending December 31, 2011, as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:
Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share
Regional and Divisional Revenue Growth Rates Excluding the Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
 
Adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than Boston Scientific does, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
