ITEM 1.01    ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On April 18, 2012, Boston Scientific Corporation (the Company) entered into a $2,000,000,000 senior unsecured credit facility, by and among the Company, as Borrower, the several lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the Credit Agreement). The new credit facility refinances the credit facilities under the Company's prior credit agreement, dated as of June 23, 2010, by and among the Company, as Borrower, BSC International Holding Limited, as Term Loan Borrower, the several lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (the 2010 Facility).
The Company may borrow from time to time up to $2,000,000,000 in revolving credit loans under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement matures on April 18, 2017, with one-year extension options subject to certain conditions, including certain lender approvals. Loans under the Revolving Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin. The applicable interest margin will be based on the Company's long-term, senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced corporate credit ratings from Fitch Ratings Ltd., Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Based on the Company's current credit ratings and Consolidated Leverage Ratio, any Eurodollar Loans and Multicurrency Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.275 percent (compared to LIBOR plus 2.050 percent under the 2010 Facility), and any ABR Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.275 percent (compared to LIBOR plus 1.050 percent under the 2010 Facility). In addition, the Company will pay a facility fee (currently 0.225 percent per year, compared to 0.450 percent per year under the 2010 Facility), based on the Company's credit ratings, Consolidated Leverage Ratio and the total amount of revolving credit commitments (generally irrespective of usage) under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains covenants which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. The ratios are calculated based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted pursuant to the Credit Agreement (Consolidated EBITDA). The Company is permitted to exclude from Consolidated EBITDA any Non-Cash Charges (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and any Cash Litigation Payments (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and will be permitted to exclude from Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) any new debt issued to fund any tax deficiency payments, provided that the sum of any excluded Cash Litigation Payments and any new debt issued to fund any tax deficiency payments shall not exceed $2,300,000,000 in the aggregate. In addition, the Company may exclude from Consolidated EBITDA any cash and non-cash charges with respect to restructurings, plant closings, staff reductions, distributor network optimization initiatives, distribution technology optimization initiatives or other similar charges, provided that the aggregate amount of all such charges shall not exceed $500,000,000.
A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Credit Agreement.

subsection 2.4(b)

Swingline Participation Amount
) equal to (i) such Revolving Lenders Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage times (ii) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans of such Swingline Lender then outstanding that were to have been repaid with such Revolving Loans.
(d)
    
Whenever, at any time after a Swingline Lender has received from any Revolving Lender such Revolving Lenders Swingline Participation Amount, such Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of the Swingline Loans, such Swingline Lender will distribute to such Revolving Lender its Swingline Participation Amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Revolving Lenders participating interest was outstanding and funded and, in the case of principal and interest payments, to reflect such Revolving Lenders pro rata portion of such payment if such payment is not sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on all Swingline Loans then due); provided, however, that in the event that such payment received by a Swingline Lender is required to be returned, such Revolving Lender will return to such Swingline Lender any portion thereof previously distributed to it by such Swingline Lender.

subsection 2.4(b)
and to purchase participating interests pursuant to
subsection 2.4(c)

The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Multicurrency Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Multicurrency Loan of such Multicurrency Lender on the Termination Date and on such other date(s) and in such other amounts as may be required from time to time pursuant to this Agreement. The Borrower hereby further agrees to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of the Multicurrency Loans advanced to it and from time to time outstanding until payment thereof in full at the rates per annum, and on the dates, set forth in
subsection 3.4

2.14.
    
Procedure for Multicurrency Borrowing.
The Borrower may request the Multicurrency Lenders to make Multicurrency Loans during the Commitment Period on any Business Day by delivering a Notice of Multicurrency Loan Borrowing. Each borrowing under the Multicurrency Commitments shall be in an amount in an Available Foreign Currency the Dollar Equivalent of which is equal to at least $1,000,000 (or, if the then Aggregate Available Multicurrency Commitments are less than $1,000,000, such lesser amount). Upon receipt of any such Notice of Multicurrency Borrowing from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Multicurrency Lender thereof. Not later than the funding time for the relevant Available Foreign Currency specified from time to time by the Administrative Agent by notice to the Borrower and the Multicurrency Lenders each Multicurrency Lender shall make an amount equal to its Multicurrency Commitment Percentage of the principal amount of Multicurrency Loans requested to be made on such Borrowing Date available to the Administrative Agent at the appropriate funding office for the relevant Available Foreign Currency specified from time to time by the Administrative Agent by notice to the Borrower and the Multicurrency Lenders in the relevant Available Foreign Currency and in immediately available funds;
provided
that, unless and until the Administrative Agent shall otherwise direct, any Multicurrency Lender may provide funds in the then applicable Dollar Equivalent (including an exchange fee and other normal and customary fees for providing this service as determined by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) thereof in lieu of the requested currency, so long as the Multicurrency Lender has given reasonable notice to the Administrative Agent of its desire and intent to so provide funds therefor promptly after (but in any event within one hour of) its receipt of any such notice for a Multicurrency Loan. The amounts made available by each Multicurrency Lender will then be made available to the Borrower at such funding office and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent;
provided
, in the case of Multicurrency Loans for which any Lender has provided funds in Dollars, the Administrative Agent shall provide such funds to the applicable Borrower in the requested currency.
2.15.
    
Termination or Reduction of Multicurrency Commitments.
The Borrower shall have the right, upon not less than three Business Days notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to each Multicurrency Lender), to terminate the Multicurrency Commitments or, from time to time, to reduce the amount of the Multicurrency Commitments;
provided
that no such termination or reduction shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the Loans made on the effective date thereof, the Available Multicurrency Commitment of any Multicurrency Lender would be less than zero. Any such reduction shall be in an amount equal to U.S. $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of U.S. $100,000 in excess thereof and shall reduce permanently the Multicurrency Commitments then in effect;
provided
further
that such notice delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.
2.16.
    
Borrowings of Revolving Credit Loans and Refunding of Loans.
(a)
    
If on any Borrowing Date on which the Borrower has requested the Multicurrency Lenders to make Multicurrency Loans (the 
Requested Multicurrency Loans
),
(i)
    
the aggregate principal amount of the Requested Multicurrency Loans exceeds the Aggregate Available Multicurrency Commitments on such Borrowing Date (before giving effect to the making and payment of any Loans required to be made pursuant to this
subsection 2.16
on such Borrowing Date) and,
(ii)
    
the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such excess is less than or equal to the aggregate Available Revolving Credit Commitments of all Non-Multicurrency Lenders (before giving effect to the making and payment of any Loans pursuant to this
subsection 2.16
on such Borrowing Date),
each Non-Multicurrency Lender shall make a Revolving Credit Loan to the Borrower on such Borrowing Date, and the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans shall be simultaneously applied to repay outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, Local Currency Loans and/or Multicurrency Loans of the Multicurrency Lenders (as directed by the Borrower) in each case in amounts such that, after giving effect to (1) such borrowings and repayments and (2) the borrowing from the Multicurrency Lenders of the Requested Multicurrency Loans, the Committed Outstanding Percentage of each Lender will equal (as nearly as possible) its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage. To effect such borrowings and repayments, (x) not later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on such Borrowing Date, the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans shall be made available by each Non-Multicurrency Lender to the Administrative Agent at its office specified in
subsection 13.2
in Dollars and in immediately available funds and the Administrative
Agent shall apply the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans toward repayment of outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, Multicurrency Loans and/or Local Currency Loans of the Multicurrency Lenders (as directed by the Borrower) and (y) concurrently with the repayment of such Loans on such Borrowing Date, (I) the Multicurrency Lenders shall, in accordance with the applicable provisions hereof, make the Requested Multicurrency Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the amount so requested by the Borrower (but not in any event greater than the Aggregate Available Multicurrency Commitments after giving effect to the making of such repayment of any Loans on such Borrowing Date) and (II) the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders whose Loans to the Borrower are repaid on such Borrowing Date pursuant to this
subsection 2.16
all interest accrued on the amounts repaid to the date of repayment, together with any amounts payable pursuant to
subsection 3.11
in connection with such repayment.
(b)
    
Subject to the limitations on borrowings contained in a given Local Currency Facility, if on any Borrowing Date on which a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower has requested Local Currency Lenders to make Local Currency Loans (the 
Requested Local Currency Loans
) under a Local Currency Facility to which such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and Local Currency Lenders are parties, (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Requested Local Currency Loans (A) exceeds the aggregate available amount of the commitments of such Local Currency Lenders under such Local Currency Facility on such Borrowing Date (before giving effect to the making and payment of any Revolving Credit Loans required to be made pursuant to this
subsection 2.16
on such Borrowing Date) or (B) together with the aggregate then outstanding principal amount of Multicurrency Loans and the aggregate outstanding amount of L/C Obligations attributable to Letters of Credit denominated in any currency other than Dollars, would exceed an amount of which the Dollar Equivalent is the Multicurrency Sublimit, (ii) after giving effect to the Requested Local Currency Loans, the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Local Currency Loans of such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower will be less than or equal to the aggregate commitments of such Local Currency Lenders under such Local Currency Facility and (iii) the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the excess described in clause (i) above is less than or equal to the Aggregate Available Revolving Credit Commitments of all Revolving Lenders other than such Local Currency Lenders (before giving effect to the making and payment of any Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this
subsection 2.16
on such Borrowing Date), each such other Revolving Lender shall make a Revolving Credit Loan to the Borrower, on such Borrowing Date, and the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans shall be simultaneously applied to repay outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, Multicurrency Loans and/or Local Currency Loans of such Local Currency Lenders (as directed by the Borrower) in each case in amounts such that, after giving effect to (1) such borrowings and repayments and (2) the borrowing from such Local Currency Lenders of the Requested Local Currency Loans, the Committed Outstandings Percentage of each Lender will equal (as nearly as possible) its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage and the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Multicurrency Loans and Local Currency Loans will not exceed the Multicurrency
Sublimit. To effect such borrowings and repayments, (x) not later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on such Borrowing Date, the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans shall be made available by each such other Revolving Lender to the Administrative Agent at its office specified in
subsection 13.2
in Dollars and in immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent shall apply the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans toward the repayment of outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, Multicurrency Loans and/or Local Currency Loans of such Local Currency Lenders (as directed by the Borrower) and (y) concurrently with the repayment of such Revolving Credit Loans on such Borrowing Date, (I) such Local Currency Lenders shall, in accordance with the applicable provisions hereof, make the Requested Local Currency Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the amount so requested by such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and (II) the relevant Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Revolving Lenders whose Loans to such Borrower are repaid on such Borrowing Date pursuant to this
subsection 2.16
all interest accrued on the amounts repaid to the date of repayment, together with any amounts payable pursuant to
subsection 3.11
in connection with such repayment.
(c)
    
If any borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans is required pursuant to this
subsection 2.16
, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in the manner provided for Revolving Credit Loans in
subsection 2.2
, except that the minimum borrowing amounts set forth in
subsection 2.2
shall not be applicable to the extent that such minimum borrowing amounts exceed the amounts of Revolving Credit Loans required to be made pursuant to this
subsection 2.16
.
2.17.
    
Increase of Revolving Credit Commitments.
The Borrower shall have the right to increase the Revolving Credit Commitments from time to time in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $500,000,000 upon prior notice to the Administrative Agent and pursuant to procedures established by the Administrative Agent and acceptable to the Borrower. Each such increase (each, an 
Additional Revolving Credit Commitment
) shall be in a principal amount of at least $25,000,000, and no such increase shall become effective (i) if a Default or Event of Default then exists or would exist immediately after giving effect thereto and (ii) unless all representations and warranties made by the Borrower required to be made pursuant to
subsection 7.2
in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are true in all material respects (to the extent not qualified by materiality standards and, if qualified by materiality standards, are true in all respects) as of the date of such increase. Each bank or other financial institution (other than an existing Lender or Lender Affiliate providing any Additional Revolving Credit Commitments) shall be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower and shall be a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement. No Lender shall have any obligation to provide any such Additional Revolving Credit Commitments unless and until it shall expressly agree under the applicable procedures to do so, at which time such Lender shall be deemed to have made an Additional Revolving Credit Commitment. The Lenders agree that this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be amended from time to time with the consent of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to reflect such Additional Revolving Credit Commitments in connection with
this
subsection 2.17
.
2.18.
    
Cash Collateral.
At any time that (i) there shall exist a Defaulting Lender and (ii) the Rating provided by (x) S&P is less than BBB, (y) Moodys is less than Baa2 or (z) Fitch is less than BBB, within twenty Business Days after receipt of the written request of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or a Swingline Lender, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to
subsection 2.19(a)(iv)
and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender); provided however, notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of providing Cash Collateral to cover all or a portion of the Fronting Exposure, at any time within twenty Business Days after the receipt of written request of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or a Swingline Lender, the Borrower (but only to the extent necessary to cover Fronting Exposure which is not covered by Cash Collateral) (i) may request that all or a portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Defaulting Lender be re-allocated to another Lender or Lenders (as acceptable to each Lender in its sole discretion) or (ii) shall have the option to exercise its right to increase the Revolving Credit Commitments under
subsection 2.17
by obtaining Additional Revolving Credit Commitments from one or more financial institutions (which may be a Lender) in an amount to cover all or a portion of the Fronting Exposure; provided further that the only limitation applicable to such exercise shall be that the aggregate amount of such increases pursuant to
Section 2.17
shall not exceed $500,000,000.
(b)
    
All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, interest bearing deposit accounts at the Administrative Agent. The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Lender, such Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders (including the Swingline Lenders), and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to
subsection 2.18(c)
. If at any time the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person that is prior to the claim of the Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the Borrower or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.
(c)
    
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this
subsection 2.18
,
subsection 2.3
,
5.1
or
2.19
or
Section 10
in respect of Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, Swingline Loans, obligations to fund
participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may be provided for herein.
(d)
    
Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with
subsection 13.6
)) or (ii) the Administrative Agents good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided, however, (x) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf the Borrower shall not be released during the continuance of an Event of Default (and following application as provided in this
subsection 2.18
may be otherwise applied in accordance with
Section 10
), and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, as applicable, may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support Fronting Exposure or other obligations with respect to requested but unfunded extensions of credit.
2.19.
    
Defaulting Lenders.
(a)
    
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:
(i)
    
That Defaulting Lenders right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in
subsection 13.1
.
(ii)
    
Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to
Section 10
or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender pursuant to
subsection 13.7
), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:
first
, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;
second
, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Lender or a Swingline Lender hereunder;
third
, if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by the Issuing Lender or a Swingline Lender, to be held as Cash Collateral for future funding obligations of that Defaulting Lender of any participation in any Swingline Loan or Letter of Credit;
fourth
, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this
Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;
fifth
, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in an interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement;
sixth
, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Lender or Swingline Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Lender or a Swingline Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
seventh
, so long as no Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lenders breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and
eighth
, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Obligations in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans or L/C Obligations were made at a time when the conditions set forth in
subsection 7.2
were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this
subsection 2.19(a)(ii)
shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents to the foregoing.
(iii)
    
That Defaulting Lender (x) shall be entitled to receive any facility fee pursuant to
subsection 2.5(a)
for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to extent allocable to the sum of (1) the Dollar Equivalent of the principal amount of the Loans funded by it and (2) its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to
subsection 2.3
,
2.14
,
2.19(a)(ii)
or
5.1
, as applicable (and the Borrower shall (A) be required to pay to each of the Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lenders, as applicable, the amount of such fee allocable to its Fronting Exposure arising from that Defaulting Lender and (B) not be required to pay the remaining amount of such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender) and (y) shall be limited in its right to receive Letter of Credit fees as provided in
subsection 5.3(a)
.
(iv)
    
During any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans pursuant to
subsections 2.3
,
2.4(b)
,
5.1
, and
5.4(a)
the Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of each non-Defaulting Lender shall
be computed without giving effect to the Revolving Credit Commitment of that Defaulting Lender; provided, that, (i) each such reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Event of Default exists; and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (1) the Revolving Credit Commitment of that non-Defaulting Lender minus (2) the Dollar Equivalent of the principal amount of the Loans of that Lender.
(b)
    
If the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, Swingline Lenders and the Issuing Lender agree in writing that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Revolving Credit Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Credit Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Revolving Lenders in accordance with their Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages (without giving effect to
subsection 2.19(a)(iv)
), whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lenders having been a Defaulting Lender.
(c)
    
If any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Defaulting Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Defaulting Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by,
subsection 13.6
), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:
(i)
    
the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in
subsection 13.6
;
(ii)
    
such Defaulting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to 100% of the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under
subsection 3.11
) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
(iii)
    
such assignment does not conflict with applicable laws; and
(iv)
    
such Defaulting Lender shall not be required to sign and deliver any assignment form in order for such assignment to become effective.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
2.20.
    
Extension of Termination Date
.
(a)
    
The Borrower may, by sending an Extension Request to the Administrative Agent (in which case the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders), at least one year in advance of the Termination Date in effect at such time (including at any time prior thereto on or after any anniversary of the Closing Date), request that the Lenders extend such Termination Date then in effect to the first anniversary of the Termination Date then in effect. Each Lender, acting in its sole discretion, shall, by notice to the Administrative Agent given not later than the date that is the 20
th
day after the date of the Extension Request, or if such day is not a Business Day, the immediately following Business Day (the 
Response Date
) advise the Administrative Agent in writing whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension (each Lender that so advises the Administrative Agent that it will not extend the Termination Date, being referred to herein as a 
Non-extending Lender
);
provided
that any Lender that does not advise the Administrative Agent by the Response Date and any Defaulting Lender shall be deemed to be a Non-extending Lender. The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to agree.
(b)
    
(i) If, on the Response Date, Lenders holding Revolving Credit Commitments that aggregate 50% or more of the total Revolving Credit Commitments shall not have agreed to extend the Termination Date, then such Termination Date shall not be so extended and the outstanding principal balance of all Loans and other amounts payable hereunder shall be payable on such Termination Date.
(ii)
    
If (and only if), on the Response Date, Lenders holding Revolving Credit Commitments that aggregate more than 50% of the total Revolving Credit Commitments shall have agreed to extend the Termination Date, then the Termination Date that shall so have agreed shall be the first anniversary of the current Termination Date (subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
subsection 2.20(d)
). In the event of such extension, the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Non-extending Lender shall terminate on the Termination Date in effect prior to such extension, all Loans and other amounts payable hereunder to such Non-extending Lenders shall become due and payable on such Termination Date and the total Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders hereunder shall be reduced by the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Non-
extending Lenders so terminated on such Termination Date.
(c)
    
In the event that the conditions of clause (ii) of paragraph (b) above have been satisfied, the Borrower shall have the right on or before the Termination Date in effect prior to the requested extension, at its own expense, to require any Non-extending Lender to transfer and assign without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
subsection 13.6
) all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more banks or other financial institutions identified to the Non-extending Lender, which may include any Lender (each an 
Additional Lender
),
provided
that (w) such Additional Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (such approvals not to be unreasonably withheld), (x) such assignment shall become effective as of a date specified by the Borrower (which shall not be later than the Termination Date in effect prior to the requested extension); (y) the Additional Lender shall pay to such Non-extending Lender in immediately available funds on the effective date of such assignment the principal of and interest accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made by it hereunder and all other amounts accrued for its account or owed to it hereunder and (z) such Non-extending Lender shall not be required to sign and deliver any assignment form in order for such assignment to become effective.
(d)
    
As a condition precedent to each such extension, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of the Borrower dated as of the Termination Date then in effect signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower certifying that, before and after giving effect to such extension, (A) the representations and warranties contained in
Section 6
(including
subsections 6.13 and 6.14
) and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Termination Date, and except that for purposes of this
subsection 2.20
, the representations and warranties contained in
subsection 6.1
shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b), respectively, of
subsection 8.1
, and (B) no Default or Event of Default exists. In addition, no such extension of the Revolving Credit Facility shall be effective if on the Termination Date then in effect, the Aggregate Total Outstandings would exceed the Revolving Credit Commitments then being extended.
SECTION 3
CERTAIN PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO THE LOANS
3.1.
    
Optional and Mandatory Prepayments.
(a)
    
The Borrower may at any time and from time to time prepay the Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (other than any amounts payable pursuant to

prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Eurodollar Loans, ABR Loans or a combination thereof, and, if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each;
provided
further
that such notice delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.

provided
further
that such notice delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.

(i)
    
If, at any time during the Commitment Period, for any reason either (1) the Aggregate Total Outstandings of all Multicurrency Lenders exceed the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments of the Multicurrency Lenders by 5% or more, (2) the Aggregate Multicurrency Outstandings exceed the aggregate Multicurrency Commitments by 5% or more, (3) the sum of the Aggregate Multicurrency Outstandings

(ii)
    
Each prepayment of Loans pursuant to this
subsection 3.1(c)
shall be accompanied by any amounts payable under
subsection 3.11
in connection with such prepayment.
(iii)
    
Notwithstanding the foregoing, mandatory prepayments of Revolving Credit Loans or Multicurrency Loans that would otherwise be required pursuant to this

Conversion and Continuation Options.
(a)
    
The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to ABR Loans by giving the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days prior irrevocable notice of such election. The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving the Administrative Agent at least three Business Days prior irrevocable notice of such election. Any such notice of conversion to Eurodollar Loans shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period therefor. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. All or any part of outstanding Eurodollar Loans and ABR Loans may be converted as
provided
herein
,
provided
that (i) no Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Majority Lenders have determined that such a conversion is not appropriate and (ii) no Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan after the date that is one month prior to the Termination Date. No Multicurrency Loan or CAF Advance may be converted into or continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in the other currency.
(b)
    
Any Eurodollar Loans may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower giving notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term Interest Period set forth in
subsection 1.1
, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans,
provided
that no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such (i) when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent
has or the Majority Lenders have determined that such a continuation is not appropriate or (ii) after the date that is one month prior to the Termination Date, and
provided
,
further
, that if the Borrower shall fail to give such notice or if such continuation is not permitted, such Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period.
(c)
    
Any Multicurrency Loans may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower giving a Notice of Multicurrency Loan Continuation,
provided
, that if the Borrower shall fail to give such Notice of Multicurrency Loan Continuation by the deadline specified therefor in
Schedule II
, such Multicurrency Loans shall automatically be continued for an Interest Period of one month.
3.3.
    
Minimum Amounts and Maximum Number of Tranches.
All borrowings, conversions and continuations of Revolving Credit Loans and Multicurrency Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar Loans comprising each Eurodollar Tranche shall be equal to $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the Multicurrency Loans comprising each Multicurrency Tranche shall be in an amount the Dollar Equivalent of which is at least $5,000,000. In no event shall there be more than seven Tranches outstanding at any time.
3.4.
    
Interest Rates and Payment Dates.

plus
the Applicable Margin in effect for such day.
(b)
    
Each ABR Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR
plus
the Applicable Margin.
(c)

otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this subsection
plus
2% or (y) in the case of any such overdue interest, facility fee or other amount, the rate described in paragraph (b) of this subsection
plus
2%, in each case from the date of such non-payment until such overdue principal, interest, facility fee or other amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment).
(f)
    
Interest pursuant to this subsection shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date or CAF Advance Interest Payment Date, as the case may be,
provided
that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (e) of this subsection shall be payable from time to time on demand.
3.5.
    
Computation of Interest and Fees.
(a)
    
All interest and fees hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (i) interest computed by reference to the ABR when it is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and (ii) interest computed with respect to Loans denominated in English Pounds Sterling shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days, and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable ABR or Eurocurrency Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each determination of a Eurocurrency Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.
(b)
    
Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of either of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to
subsections 3.4(a)
,
(b)
or
(d)
.
3.6.
    
Inability to Determine Interest Rate.
If prior to the first day of any Interest Period:
(a)
    
the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period, or
(b)
    
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Lenders or the Majority Multicurrency Lenders, as the case may be, that the Eurocurrency Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (w) any Eurodollar Loans or Multicurrency Loans, as the case may be, requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as ABR Loans,
provided
, that, notwithstanding the provisions of
subsection 2.2
or
2.14
, the Borrower may cancel the request for such Eurodollar Loan or Multicurrency Loan, as the case may be, by written notice to the Administrative Agent one Business Day prior to the first day of such Interest Period and the Borrower shall not be subject to any liability pursuant to
subsection 3.11
with respect to such cancelled request, (x) any Loans that were to have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as ABR Loans, (y) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the first day of such Interest Period, to ABR Loans and (z) any Multicurrency Loans to which such Interest Period relates shall be repaid on the first day of such Interest Period. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar Loans or Multicurrency Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the right to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans.
3.7.
    
Pro Rata Treatment and Payments.
(a)
    
Each payment of principal and interest in respect of any optional prepayment of Revolving Credit Loans or Multicurrency Loans shall be made
pro
rata
according to the amounts then due and owing to the respective Revolving Lender or Multicurrency Lender, as the case may be.
(b)
    
Except as provided in
subsection 2.16
, each borrowing by the Borrower of Revolving Credit Loans from the Revolving Lenders hereunder shall be made
pro
rata
according to the Funding Commitment Percentages of the Revolving Lenders in effect on the date of such borrowing. Each payment by the Borrower on account of any facility fee hereunder and any reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Revolving Lenders shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent among the Revolving Lenders
pro
rata
according to the Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages of the Lenders. Except as provided in
subsection 2.16
, each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal on the Revolving Credit Loans shall be made
pro
rata
according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Loans then due and owing to the Revolving Lenders. Each payment by the Borrower of interest in respect of the Revolving Credit Loans shall be applied to the amounts of such obligations owing to the Revolving Lenders
pro
rata
according to the respective amounts then due and owing to the Revolving Lenders. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder in respect of amounts denominated in Dollars,
whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without set off or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the relevant Lenders, at the Administrative Agents office specified in
subsection 13.2
, in Dollars and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the relevant Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans or Multicurrency Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan or a Multicurrency Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity of such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension) unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.
(c)
    
Each borrowing of Multicurrency Loans by the Borrower shall be made, and any reduction of the Multicurrency Commitments shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent,
pro
rata
according to the Multicurrency Commitment Percentages of the Multicurrency Lenders. Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal on Multicurrency Loans shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent
pro
rata
according to the respective principal amounts of the Multicurrency Loans then due and owing by the Borrower to each Multicurrency Lender. Each payment by the Borrower of interest in respect of the Multicurrency Loans shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent to the amounts of such obligations owing to the Multicurrency Lenders
pro
rata
according to the respective amounts then due and owing to the Multicurrency Lenders. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower on account of Multicurrency Loans hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and shall be made at or before the payment time for the currency of such Multicurrency Loan prior to 3:00 PM (in the local time of the Borrower), on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Multicurrency Lenders, at the payment office for the currency of such Multicurrency Loan from time to time specified by the Administrative Agent by notice to the Multicurrency Lenders and the Borrower, in the currency of such Multicurrency Loan and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Multicurrency Lenders entitled to receive the same promptly upon receipt in like funds as received;
provided
that the Administrative Agent will provide funds in the then applicable Dollar Equivalent thereof (including an exchange fee and other normal and customary fees for providing this service as determined by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) to those Multicurrency Lenders that had funded the Revolving Credit Loans with the Dollar Equivalent as provided in
subsection 2.14
.
(d)
    
Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments and Commitment reductions
may be made on a non
pro
rata
basis under this Agreement in order to give effect to
subsection 2.19 and 2.20
.
(e)
    
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to (i) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate (in the case of a borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans or CAF Advances denominated in Dollars) and (ii) the Administrative Agents reasonable estimate of its average daily cost of funds (in the case of a borrowing of Multicurrency Loans or CAF Advances denominated in a currency other than Dollars), in each case for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lenders share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon equal to (i) the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans hereunder (in the case of a borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans or CAF Advances or CAF Advances denominated in Dollars) and (ii) the Administrative Agents reasonable estimate of its average daily cost of funds
plus
the Applicable Margin applicable to Multicurrency Loans (in the case of a borrowing of Multicurrency Loans or CAF Advances denominated in a currency other than Dollars), on demand, from the Borrower.
3.8.
    
Illegality.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date hereof the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans or Multicurrency Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans or Multicurrency Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans or Multicurrency Loans as such and convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be cancelled, (b) such Lenders Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to ABR Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law and (c) such Lenders Multicurrency Loans shall be prepaid on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto. If any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to
subsection 3.11
.
3.9.
    
Requirements of Law.
(a)
    
If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation or administration of any law or regulation by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority that would be complied with generally by similarly situated banks or lenders acting reasonably (whether or not having the force of law and for the avoidance of doubt, including any changes resulting from requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy issued after the date hereof in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or promulgated after the date hereof by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Loans, Multicurrency Loans or LIBO Rate CAF Advances or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit (except any reserve or other requirement contemplated by Section 3.9(b) or (c) other than as set forth below) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material (except, for the avoidance of doubt, for Non-Excluded Taxes indemnified under Section 3.10 and Excluded Taxes), then the Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
(b)
    
If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in or interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental or regulatory authority which becomes effective after the date hereof (for the avoidance of doubt, including any changes resulting from requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy issued after the date hereof in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or promulgated after the date hereof by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III), there shall be any increase in the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lenders Loans or commitment to extend credit and other commitments of this type by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lenders Loans or commitment to extend
credit hereunder. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes as to the calculations therein, absent manifest error. Such certificate shall be in reasonable detail and shall certify that the claim for additional amounts referred to therein is generally consistent with such Lenders treatment of similarly situated customers of such Lender whose transactions with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information therein.
(c)
    
For purposes of the foregoing paragraphs (a) and (b), the amendments to 12 C.F.R. Part 327 set forth in the final rule attached to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Financial Institution Letter FIL-8-2011, dated February 9, 2011, shall be deemed to have been introduced and adopted after the date of this Agreement.
3.10.
    
Taxes.
(a)
    
All payments made by the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Taxes excluding (i) all net income Taxes, franchise Taxes or other Taxes, including branch profits Taxes, in each case imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between the Administrative Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such Tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, any Loan Document), (ii) in the case of a Lender other than an assignee pursuant to a request by a Borrower under
subsection 3.12
, any U.S. federal withholding Tax that is imposed under a law in effect at the time such Lender becomes a party hereto (or designates a new lending office), except to the extent that such Lender (or its assignor, if any) was entitled, immediately prior to the time of designation of a new lending office (or assignment), to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to such withholding Tax pursuant to this Section, (iii) any withholding Tax imposed as a result of a Lender failing to comply with
subsection 3.10(c)
and (iv) any U.S. federal Taxes that are imposed by reason of FATCA (Taxes in clauses (i) to (iv) being 
Excluded Taxes
). If any such non-excluded Taxes (
Non-Excluded Taxes
) are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any Loan Document as determined in good faith by the applicable withholding agent, (x) such amounts shall be paid to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and (y) the amounts so payable by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in such Loan Document as if such withholding or deduction had not been made. Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by the Borrower as promptly as possible thereafter
the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof or other evidence of such payment satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (in its reasonable discretion). If the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental Taxes that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure. The agreements in this subsection shall survive the termination of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder and thereunder.
(b)
    
The Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and each Lender within 20 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Non-Excluded Taxes (including Non-Excluded Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto;
provided
that the Borrower shall not be obligated to indemnify the Administrative Agent or any such Lender pursuant to this
subsection 3.10(b)
in respect of penalties, interest or reasonable expenses if such penalties, interest or reasonable expenses are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the person seeking indemnification.
(c)
    
Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.10(c)(A), (B) and (D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event the Borrower is a U.S. Person,
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax;
(B) any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
J-2 or Exhibit J-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Non-U.S. Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Non-U.S. Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Non-U.S. Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit J-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(C) any Non-U.S. Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (iii), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, a Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section that such Lender is not legally able to deliver.
(d)
    
If the Borrower pays any additional amounts or makes an indemnity payment under this
subsection 3.10
to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, and such Lender or the Administrative Agent determines in its sole discretion exercised in good faith that it has actually received in connection therewith any refund of the underlying Non-Excluded Taxes, such Lender or the Administrative Agent shall pay to the Borrower
an amount equal to such refund which was obtained by such Lender or Administrative Agent (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or Additional Amounts paid by the Borrower under this
subsection 3.10
with respect to the Non-Excluded Taxes giving rise to such refund) net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Lender or the Administrative Agent with respect to such refund, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant taxation authority);
provided
,
however
, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Lender or the Administrative Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower to any Lender or the Administrative Agent in the event any Lender or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such refund, plus interest and penalties (excluding interest and penalties attributable to the negligence or willful misconduct of such Lender or the Administrative Agent). This paragraph shall not be construed to require any Lender or the Administrative Agent to disclose any confidential information to the Borrower or any other Person (including its Tax returns).
(e)
    
Each Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent for the full amount of any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, withholdings or similar charges imposed by any Governmental Authority that are attributable to such Lender and that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, together with all interest, penalties, reasonable costs and expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto (but only to the extent not already paid by the Borrower), as determined by the Administrative Agent in good faith. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
3.11.
    
Indemnity.
The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold each such Lender harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans, Local Currency Loans, Multicurrency Loans or CAF Advances after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower in making any prepayment after the Borrower or such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans, Local Currency Loans, Multicurrency Loans or CAF Advances or the conversion of Eurodollar Loans to ABR Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) or, in the case of CAF Advances, the applicable CAF Advance Maturity Date (or proposed CAF Advance Maturity Date), in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin or any positive margin applicable to CAF Advances included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which would have accrued to such Lender on
such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder and thereunder.
3.12.
    
Change of Lending Office; Removal of Lender.
Each Lender agrees that if it makes any demand for payment under
subsection 3.9
or
3.10(a)
, or if any adoption or change of the type described in
subsection 3.8
shall occur with respect to it, (i) it will use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions and so long as such efforts would not be disadvantageous to it, as determined in its sole discretion) to designate a different lending office if the making of such a designation would reduce or obviate the need for the Borrower to make payments under
subsection 3.9
or
3.10(a)
, or would eliminate or reduce the effect of any adoption or change described in
subsection 3.8
or (ii) it will, upon at least five Business Days notice from the Borrower to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, assign, pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of
subsection 13.6(c)
and
13.19

SECTION 4
LOCAL CURRENCY FACILITIES
4.1.
    
Terms of Local Currency Facilities.
(a)
    
Subject to the provisions of this
Section 4
, the Borrower may in its discretion from time to time designate any Subsidiary of the Borrower organized under the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States as a 
Foreign Subsidiary Borrower
 and any Qualified Credit Facility to which such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and any one or more Lenders (or its Affiliates, agencies or branches) is a party as a 
Local Currency Facility
, with the consent of the Administrative Agent and each such Lender in its sole discretion, by delivering a Local Currency Facility Addendum to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (through the Administrative Agent) executed by the Borrower, each such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and each such Lender,
provided
, that on the effective date of such designation no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Concurrently with the delivery of a Local Currency Facility Addendum, the Borrower or the relevant Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent copies of all documentation executed and delivered by such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower in connection therewith, together with, if applicable, an English translation thereof. Except as otherwise provided in this
Section 4
or in the definition of 
Qualified Credit Facility
 in
subsection 1.1
, the terms and conditions of each Local Currency Facility shall be determined by mutual agreement of the relevant Foreign Subsidiary Borrower(s), Local Currency Lender(s) and the Administrative Agent. The documentation governing each Local Currency Facility shall (i) contain an express acknowledgement that such Local Currency Facility shall be subject to the provisions of this
Section 4
, (ii) if more than one Lender is a party thereto, designate a Local Currency Facility Agent for such Local Currency Facility and (iii) include an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent from the jurisdiction in which such Local Currency Facility is established that the documentation governing such Local Currency Facility is enforceable in accordance with its terms. Each of the Borrower and, by agreeing to any Local Currency Facility designation as contemplated hereby, each relevant Local Currency Lender (if any) party thereto which is an Affiliate, branch or agency of a Lender, acknowledges and agrees that each reference in this Agreement to any Lender shall, to the extent applicable, be deemed to be a reference to such Local Currency Lender. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Local Currency Facility, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.
(b)
    
The documentation governing each Local Currency Facility shall set forth (i) the maximum amount (expressed in Dollars) available to be borrowed from all Local Currency Lenders under such Local Currency Facility (as the same may be reduced from time to time, a 
Local Currency Facility Maximum Borrowing Amount
) and (ii) with respect to each Local Currency Lender party to such Local Currency Facility, the maximum amount (expressed in Dollars) available to be borrowed from such Local
Currency Lender thereunder (as the same may be reduced from time to time, a 
Local Currency Lender Maximum Borrowing Amount
).
(c)
    
Except as otherwise required by applicable law, in no event shall the Local Currency Lenders party to a Local Currency Facility have the right to accelerate the Local Currency Loans outstanding thereunder, or to terminate their commitments (if any) to make such Local Currency Loans prior to the earlier of the stated termination date in respect thereof or the Termination Date, except, in each case, in connection with an acceleration of the Loans or a termination of the Commitments pursuant to
Section 10
hereof,
provided
, that nothing in this paragraph (c) shall be deemed to require any Local Currency Lender to make a Local Currency Loan if the applicable conditions precedent to the making of such Local Currency Loan set forth in the documentation governing the relevant Local Currency Facility have not been satisfied. No Local Currency Loan may be made under a Local Currency Facility if (i) after giving effect thereto, the conditions precedent in
subsection 7.2
hereof would not be satisfied or (ii) after giving effect to the making of such Local Currency Loan and the simultaneous application of the proceeds thereof, (A) the Aggregate Total Outstandings of all Lenders at any time exceeds the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments or (B) the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Multicurrency Loans, Local Currency Loans and L/C Obligations attributable to Letters of Credit denominated in any currency other than Dollars would exceed the Multicurrency Sublimit.
(d)
    
The relevant Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent copies of any amendment, supplement or other modification (including any change in commitment amounts or in the Local Currency Lenders participating in any Local Currency Facility) to the terms of any Local Currency Facility promptly after the effectiveness thereof (together with, if applicable, an English translation thereof). If any such amendment, supplement or other modification to a Local Currency Facility shall (i) add a Local Currency Lender as a Local Currency Lender thereunder or (ii) change the Local Currency Facility Maximum Borrowing Amount or any Local Currency Lender Maximum Borrowing Amount with respect thereto, the Borrower shall promptly furnish an appropriately revised Local Currency Facility Addendum, executed by the Borrower, the relevant Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and the affected Local Currency Lenders (or any agent acting on their behalf), to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (through the Administrative Agent).
(e)
    
The Borrower may terminate its designation of a facility as a Local Currency Facility, with the consent of each Local Currency Lender party thereto in its sole discretion, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, which notice shall be executed by the Borrower, the relevant Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and each Local Currency Lender party to such Local Currency Facility (or any agent acting on their behalf). Once notice of such termination is received by the Administrative Agent, such Local Currency Facility and the loans and other obligations outstanding thereunder shall immediately cease to be subject to the terms of this Agreement.
4.2.
    
Reporting of Local Currency Outstandings.
(a)
    
On the date of the making of any Local Currency Loan having a maturity of 30 or more days to a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and on the last Business Day of each month on which a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower has any outstanding Local Currency Loans, the Local Currency Facility Agent for such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a Notice of Local Currency Outstandings and the Administrative Agent shall deliver a copy of such Notice of Local Currency Outstandings to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will, at the request of any Local Currency Facility Agent, advise such Local Currency Facility Agent of the Exchange Rate used by the Administrative Agent in calculating the Dollar Equivalent of Local Currency Loans under the related Local Currency Facility on any date.
(b)
    
For purposes of any calculation under this Agreement in which the amount of the Aggregate Local Currency Outstandings of any Lender is a component, the Administrative Agent shall make such calculation on the basis of the Notices of Local Currency Outstanding received by it at least two Business Days prior to the date of such calculation.
SECTION 5

L/C Commitment.
(a)
    
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Issuing Lender, in reliance on the agreements of the other Revolving Lenders set forth in
subsection 5.4(a)
, agrees to issue letters of credit (
Letters of Credit
) for the account of the Borrower on any Business Day during the Commitment Period in such form as may be approved from time to time by the Issuing Lender;
provided
that the Issuing Lender shall not issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment, (ii) the aggregate amount of the Available Revolving Credit Commitments would be less than zero, (iii) the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Multicurrency Loans, Local Currency Loans and L/C Obligations attributable to Letters of Credit denominated in any currency other than Dollars would exceed the Multicurrency Sublimit or (iv) any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the Issuing Lender has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, reasonably satisfactory to the Issuing Lender with the Borrower or such Lender to eliminate the Issuing Lenders actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to
subsection 2.19(a)(iv)
) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as to which the Issuing Lender has actual or potential Fronting Exposure. Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be denominated in Dollars or any Available Foreign Currency or any other currency acceptable to the Issuing Lender,
(ii) have a face amount of at least $1,000,000 (unless otherwise agreed by the Issuing Lender) and (iii) expire (or be subject to termination by notice from the Issuing Lender to the beneficiary thereof) no later than the date that is five Business Days prior to the Termination Date.
(b)
    
The Issuing Lender shall not at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit if such issuance would conflict with, or cause the Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law.
(c)
    
Letters of Credit issued under the Existing Credit Facilities and outstanding on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be issued under this Agreement on the Closing Date.
5.2.
    
Procedure for Issuance of Letter of Credit.
The Borrower may from time to time request that the Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of the Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as the Issuing Lender may request. Upon receipt of any Application, the Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event shall the Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by the Issuing Lender and the Borrower. The Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Borrower promptly following the issuance thereof. The Issuing Lender shall promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn promptly furnish to the Lenders, notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit (including the amount thereof).
5.3.
    
Fees and Other Charges.
(a)
    
The Borrower will pay a fee on the actual daily undrawn and unexpired amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans, shared ratably among the Revolving Lenders and payable quarterly in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the issuance date; such fee with respect to each Letter of Credit denominated in any currency other than Dollars shall be payable in Dollars, and for purposes of calculating the amount of such fee applicable to each Letter of Credit denominated in any currency other than Dollars, the actual daily undrawn and unexpired amount of such Letter of Credit shall be the Dollar Equivalent of such amount calculated at the Exchange Rate as of the relevant L/C Fee Payment Date; provided, however, that any such fees otherwise payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit as to
which such Defaulting Lender has not provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the Issuing Lender pursuant to
subsection 5.1
shall be payable, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, to the other Lenders in accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Revolving Credit Commitment Percentages allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to
subsection 2.19(a)(iv)
, with the balance of such fee, if any, payable to the Issuing Lender for its own account. In addition, the Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee in the amount separately agreed to by the Issuing Lender and the Borrower on the actual daily undrawn and unexpired amount of each Letter of Credit, payable quarterly in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the issuance date; such fee with respect to each Letter of Credit denominated in any currency other than Dollars shall be payable in Dollars, and for purposes of calculating the amount of such fee applicable to each Letter of Credit denominated in any currency other than Dollars, the actual daily undrawn and unexpired amount of such Letter of Credit shall be the Dollar Equivalent of such amount calculated at the Exchange Rate as of the relevant L/C Fee Payment Date.
(b)
    
In addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall pay or reimburse the Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and expenses as are incurred or charged by the Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of Credit.
5.4.
    
L/C Participations.
(a)
    
The Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce the Issuing Lender to issue Letters of Credit, each L/C Participant irrevocably agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from the Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions set forth below, for such L/C Participants own account and risk an undivided interest equal to such L/C Participants Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage in the Issuing Lenders obligations and rights under and in respect of each Letter of Credit and the amount of each draft paid by the Issuing Lender thereunder. Each L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with the Issuing Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit for which the Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender through the Administrative Agent (or the Administrative Agent shall apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) upon demand at the Administrative Agents address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participants Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so reimbursed.
(b)
    
If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to the Issuing Lender pursuant to
subsection 5.4(a)
in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to the Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender on demand an amount equal to the product of
(i) such amount, times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Lender, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to
subsection 5.4(a)
is not made available to the Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans. A certificate of the Issuing Lender submitted through the Administrative Agent to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
(c)
    
Whenever, at any time after the Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its
pro
rata
share of such payment in accordance with
subsection 5.4(a)
, the Administrative Agent receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by the Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, the Administrative Agent will distribute to such L/C Participant its
pro
rata
share thereof;
provided
,
however
, that in the event that any such payment received by the Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by the Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to the Issuing Lender through the Administrative Agent the portion thereof previously distributed by the Issuing Lender to it.
5.5.
    
Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower.
The Borrower agrees to reimburse the Issuing Lender through the Administrative Agent on the Business Day next succeeding the Business Day on which the Issuing Lender notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of the date and amount of a draft presented under any Letter of Credit and paid by the Issuing Lender for the amount of (a) such draft so paid and (b) any taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with such payment. Each such payment shall be made to the Issuing Lender in Dollars and in immediately available funds. Interest shall be payable on any such amounts from the date on which the relevant draft is paid until payment in full at the rate set forth in (i) until the Business Day next succeeding the date of the relevant notice,
subsection 3.4(b)
and (ii) thereafter,
subsection 3.4(e)
. Each drawing under any Letter of Credit shall (unless an event of the type described in clause (i) or (ii) of
subsection 10(g)
shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the Borrower, in which case the procedures specified in
subsection 5.4
for funding by L/C Participants shall apply) constitute a request by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for a borrowing pursuant to
subsection 2.2
of ABR Loans in the amount of such drawing (and the minimum borrowing amount in such subsection shall not apply to such borrowing). The Borrowing Date with respect to such borrowing shall be the first date on which a borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans could be made, pursuant to
subsection 2.2
, if the Administrative Agent had received a notice of such borrowing at the time the
Administrative Agent receives notice from the relevant Issuing Lender of such drawing under such Letter of Credit.
5.6.
    
Obligations Absolute.
The Borrowers obligations under this
Section 5
shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower may have or have had against the Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person. The Borrower also agrees with the Issuing Lender that the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for, and the Borrowers Reimbursement Obligations under
subsection 5.5
shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. The Issuing Lender shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Lender. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct and in accordance with the standards of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability of the Issuing Lender to the Borrower.
5.7.
    
Letter of Credit Payments.
If any draft shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of the date and amount thereof. The responsibility of the Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment are substantially in conformity with such Letter of Credit.
5.8.
    
Applications.
To the extent that any provision of any Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this
Section 5
, the provisions of this
Section 5
shall apply.
5.9.
    
Reimbursement Obligations for Certain Letters of Credit Denominated in Currencies Other Than Dollars.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 5
, in the event that any Letter of Credit is denominated in any currency other than Dollars, the amount of the Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower pursuant to
subsection 5.5
in respect of such Letter of Credit shall bear interest as
provided in
subsection 5.5
with respect to amounts owing in Dollars;
provided
, that (i) the interest rate on such amounts shall be the rate reasonably determined by the Issuing Lender to be the equivalent rate, in respect of the relevant non-Dollar currency, to the applicable rate provided in
subsection 5.5
with respect to amounts denominated in Dollars and (ii) if the Borrower fails to pay any such Reimbursement Obligation required by
subsection 5.5
on or prior to the third Business Day following the date of the drawing to which such Reimbursement Obligation relates, then, on the fourth Business Day following such date of drawing, the relevant Issuing Lender, in cooperation with the Administrative Agent, shall determine the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such Reimbursement Obligation, and the Borrowers obligation in respect of such Reimbursement Obligation shall be converted to such Dollar Equivalent, with interest thereon as provided in
subsection 5.5
(
provided
, that if the Application in respect of such Letter of Credit provides for conversion of such amount into Dollars on any earlier date or at any other conversion rate, the provisions hereunder shall control with respect to such conversion).
SECTION 6
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
To induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans and issue or participate in the Letters of Credit, the Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and each Lender that:
6.1.
    
Financial Condition.
The consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 and the related consolidated statements of operations and of cash flows for the fiscal years ended on such dates, reported on by Ernst & Young LLP, copies of which have heretofore been furnished to each Lender, are complete and correct and present fairly the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such dates, and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the fiscal years then ended. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the date of the Borrowers most recent publicly available Form 10-Q and the related unaudited consolidated statements of operations and of cash flows for the fiscal period ended on such date, certified by a Responsible Officer, copies of which have heretofore been furnished to each Lender, are complete and materially correct and present fairly (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments) the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the fiscal period then ended. All such annual financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, were, as of the date prepared, prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by such accountants or Responsible Officer, as the case may be, and as disclosed therein). The quarterly financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933. Accordingly, such quarterly financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the Borrower, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Neither the Borrower nor any of its consolidated Subsidiaries had, at the date of the most recent balance sheet referred to above, any of the following except as disclosed in the Borrowers Form 10-K and 10-Q filings: any material Guarantee Obligation, material contingent liability or material liability for taxes, or any material long-term lease or material unusual forward or long-term commitment, including, without limitation, any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange transaction, which is not reflected in the foregoing financial statements or in the notes thereto.
6.2.
    
Corporate Existence; Compliance with Law.
Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the corporate power and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law, except to the extent that the failure of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) (in each such case, only with respect to Subsidiaries of the Borrower), (c) and (d) to be true and correct could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
6.3.
    
Corporate Power; Consents and Authorization; Enforceable Obligations.
The Borrower has the corporate power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to borrow hereunder and has taken all necessary corporate action to (i) authorize the borrowings on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, any Notes and any Applications, (ii) to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and (iii) in the case of the Borrower, to guarantee all Obligations of any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower hereunder. No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority (including, without limitation, exchange control) or any other Person is required with respect to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the borrowings or guarantee hereunder or with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of the Loan Documents to which the Borrower is party. This Agreement and each other Loan Document to which the Borrower is, or is to become, a party has been or will be, duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower. This Agreement and each other Loan Document to which the Borrower is, or is to become, a party constitutes or will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, examination, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
6.4.
    
No Legal Bar.
The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents, the borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not violate any Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation of the Borrower or of any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of its or their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any such Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
6.5.
    
No Default.
Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under or with respect to any of its Contractual Obligations in any respect which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.
6.6.
    
Taxes.
Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has filed or caused to be filed all tax returns which, to the knowledge of the Borrower, are required to be filed and has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or on any assessments made against it (other than any the amount or validity of which are currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on the books of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be), except to the extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
6.7.
    
Federal Regulations.
No part of the proceeds of any Loans will be used in any manner that would violate Regulation U of the Board as now and from time to time hereafter in effect.
6.8.
    
ERISA.
Neither a Reportable Event nor a failure to meet the minimum funding standards (within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan other than a Multiemployer Plan, and each Plan has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code, where the liability could be reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;
provided
,
however
, that with respect to any Multiemployer Plan, such representation is made only to the knowledge of the Borrower. No termination of a Single Employer Plan pursuant to Section 4041(c) or 4042 of ERISA has occurred, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen, during such five-year period. There has been no determination that any Single Employer Plan is, or is expected to be, in at risk status (within the meaning of Section 430 of the Code or Section 303 of ERISA). Neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has had a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan and to the knowledge of the Borrower, neither
the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would become subject to any liability under ERISA if the Borrower or any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this representation is made or deemed made which liability could be reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Multiemployer Plan is in Reorganization, Insolvent or in endangered or critical status (within the meaning of Section 432 of the Code or Section 305 of ERISA).
6.9.
    
Investment Company Act; Other Regulations.
The Borrower is not required to be registered as an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Borrower is not subject to regulation under any Federal or State statute or regulation (other than Regulation X of the Board) which limits its ability to incur Indebtedness.

The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.
11.3.
    
Exculpatory Provisions.
Neither any Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document (except for its or such Persons own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Borrower
or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by such Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of the Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower.
11.4.
    
Reliance by Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel to the Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority Lenders as it deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Majority Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.
11.5.
    
Notice of Default.
The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a notice of default. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Majority Lenders;
provided
that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers, if any, and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.
11.7.
    
Indemnification.
The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent (or sub-agent), in its capacity, any Issuing Lender, in its capacity, and any Related Party acting for the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent) or any Issuing Lender in connection with such capacity (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers, if any, to do so), ratably according to their respective Aggregate Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent), any Issuing Lender or such Related Party in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent), any Issuing Lender or such Related Party under
or in connection with any of the foregoing;
provided
that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements which are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent (or sub-agent), any Issuing Lender or any Related Party acting for the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent) or any Issuing Lender in connection with such capacity. The agreements in this subsection shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
11.8.
    
Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity.
The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or the Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, if any, as though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. With respect to the Loans made by it and with respect to any Letter of Credit issued or participated in by it, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms Lender and Lenders shall include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.
11.9.
    
Successor Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 10 days notice to the Lenders. If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Majority Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent (provided that it shall have been approved by the Borrower), shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder. Upon the earlier of (i) the 10 day period following the Administrative Agents notice of resignation to the Lenders and (ii) the acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section). The term Administrative Agent shall mean such successor agent, and the former Administrative Agents rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. After any retiring Administrative Agents resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Section 11
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Any resignation by JPMorgan as Administrative Agent pursuant to this section shall also constitute its resignation as Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender. Upon the
acceptance of a successors appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender, (b) the retiring Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor Issuing Lender shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Lender to effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit.
11.10.
    
The Arrangers, the Bookrunners, the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agents.
None of the Arrangers, the Bookrunners, the Syndication Agent or the Documentation Agents shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Arrangers, the Bookrunners, the Syndication Agent or the Documentation Agents shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on the Arrangers, the Bookrunners, the Syndication Agent or the Documentation Agents in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking any action hereunder.

12.1.
    
Guarantee.

The Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors, endorsees, transferees and assigns, the prompt and complete payment and performance by the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations.
(b)
    
No payment or payments made by the Borrower or any other Person or received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from the Borrower or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or appropriation or application, at any time or from time to time, in reduction of or in payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of the Borrower hereunder which shall, notwithstanding any such payment or payments, remain liable hereunder for the Obligations until the Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated.
(c)
    
The Borrower agrees that whenever, at any time, or from time to time, it shall make any payment to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of its liability hereunder, it will notify the Administrative Agent and such Lender in writing that such payment is made under this Section for such purpose.
12.2.
    
No Subrogation.
Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by the Borrower hereunder, or any set-off or application of funds of the Borrower by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Borrower shall not be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers or against any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Obligations, nor shall the Borrower seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers in respect of payments made by the Borrower hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and the Local Currency Lenders by the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers on account of the Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated. If any amount shall be paid to the Borrower on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by the Borrower in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, segregated from other funds of the Borrower, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by the Borrower, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by the Borrower (duly indorsed by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as Administrative Agent may determine.

None of the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations or for this Agreement or any property subject thereto. When making any demand hereunder against the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers or any other guarantor, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make any such demand or to collect any payments from a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower or any such other guarantor or any release of a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower or such other guarantor shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligations or liabilities hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, express or implied, or as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.

Section 12
shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity,
regularity or enforceability of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any of the Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers against the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (c) any law, regulation, decree or order of any jurisdiction, or any other event, affecting the Obligations or any Lenders rights with respect thereto, including, without limitation: (i) the application of any such law, regulation, decree or order, including any prior approval, that would prevent the exchange of a non-Dollar currency for Dollars or the remittance of funds outside of such jurisdiction or the unavailability of Dollars in any legal exchange market in such jurisdiction in accordance with normal commercial practice; or (ii) a declaration of banking moratorium or any suspension of payments by banks in such jurisdiction or the imposition by such jurisdiction or any governmental authority thereof of any moratorium on the required rescheduling or restructuring of, or required approval of payments on, any indebtedness in such jurisdiction; or (iii) any expropriation, confiscation, nationalization or requisition by such country or any governmental authority that directly or indirectly deprives the companies in such jurisdiction of any payment obligation under the Obligations; or (iv) any war (whether or not declared), insurrection, revolution, hostile act, civil strife or similar events occurring in such jurisdiction that has the same effect as the events described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above (in each of the cases contemplated in clauses (i) through (iv) above, to the extent occurring or existing on or at any time after the date of this Agreement), or (d) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers or the Borrower) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers for the Obligations, or of the Borrower under this
Section 12
, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers or any such other Person or of any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve the Borrower of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower. This
Section 12
shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon the Borrower and its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and their respective successors, endorsees, transferees and assigns, until all the Obligations and the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement shall have been satisfied by payment in full and the Commitments shall be terminated, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of this Agreement the Foreign Subsidiary
Borrowers may be free from any Obligations.
12.5.

Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments.
(a)
    
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each Lender.
(b)
    
Any Lender, other than a Conduit Lender, may, in the ordinary course of
its commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities (other than a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any natural Person) (
Participants
) participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, such Lenders obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Loan for all purposes under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. No Lender shall be entitled to create in favor of any Participant, in the participation agreement pursuant to which such Participants participating interest shall be created or otherwise, any right to vote on, consent to or approve any matter relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document except for those specified in clauses (i) and (ii) of the proviso to
subsection 13.1(a)
. The Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due or unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement,
provided
that, in purchasing such participating interest, such Participant shall be deemed to have agreed to share with the Lenders the proceeds thereof as provided in
subsection 13.7(a)
as fully as if it were a Lender hereunder. The Borrower also agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
subsections 3.9
,
3.10
and
3.11
with respect to its participation in the Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to time as if it was a Lender;
provided
that, in the case of
subsection 3.10
, such Participant shall have complied with the requirements of said subsection, and
provided
,
further
, that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to any such subsection than the transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender to such Participant had no such transfer occurred. Each Lender that sells a participation, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the 
Participant Register
). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive, and such Lender, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register pursuant to the terms hereof as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(c)
    
Any Lender, other than a Conduit Lender, may, in the ordinary course of
its commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time and from time to time, assign (i) to any Lender or any Lender Affiliate with the consent (in each case, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender (in the case of assignments of Revolving Commitments) or (ii) with the consent of the Borrower (unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing), the Administrative Agent and Issuing Lender (which consent in each case shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), to an additional bank, financial institution, or other entity (an 
Assignee
) all or any part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption, substantially in the form of
Exhibit H
, executed by such Assignee, such assigning Lender (and, in the case of an Assignee that is not a Lender or a Lender Affiliate, by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender) and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance and recording in the Register,
provided
that, except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lenders Commitments or Loans, the amount of the Commitments or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 (or such lesser amount as may be agreed to by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent), and
provided
further
that no such assignment shall be made to (A) any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (C) any natural person. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date determined pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption, (x) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder with Commitments as set forth therein, and (y) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lenders rights and obligations under this Agreement, such assigning Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the indemnity and expense reimbursement provisions in the Loan Documents arising out of the period prior to the assignment). Each assignment by a Lender of any portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment shall be accompanied by assignment by such Lender to the same Assignee of the same percentage of such Lenders Multicurrency Commitment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign at any time to its designating Lender hereunder without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent any or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder and pursuant to its designation agreement and without regard to the limitations set forth in the first sentence of this
subsection 13.6(c)
.
(d)
    
The Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Borrower, shall maintain at the address of the Administrative Agent referred to in
subsection 13.2
a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register (the 
Register
) for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitments of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to
time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Loan or other obligation hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. Any assignment of any Loan or other obligation hereunder not evidenced by a Note shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the Register.
In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender.
The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(e)
    
Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an Assignee (and, in the case of an Assignee that is not then a Lender or a Lender Affiliate, by the Borrower (if required) and the Administrative Agent) together with payment to the Administrative Agent of a registration and processing fee of $4,000, the Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Assignment and Asssumption and (ii) on the effective date determined pursuant thereto record the information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance and recordation to the Lenders and the Borrower;
provided
that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such registration and processing fee in the case of any assignment.
(f)
    
The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Assignee (each, a 
Transferee
) and any prospective Transferee, subject to the provisions of
subsection 13.14
, any and all financial information in such Lenders possession concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower in connection with such Lenders credit evaluation of such Borrower and its Affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Agreement.
(g)
    
For avoidance of doubt, the parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the provisions of this subsection concerning assignments of Loans and Notes relate only to absolute assignments and that such provisions do not prohibit assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation, any pledge or assignment by a Lender of any Loan or Note to any Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender in accordance with applicable law.
(h)
    
In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall (unless otherwise agreed by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon
distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all applicable Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
13.7.
    
Adjustments; Set-off.
(a)
    
If any Lender (a 
benefited Lender
) shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans or the Reimbursement Obligations owing to it (or any participation therein arising pursuant to
subsection 13.15
) then due and owing, or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in
subsection 10(g)
, or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender (other than to the extent expressly provided herein or by court order), if any, in respect of such other Lenders Loans or the Reimbursement Obligations owing to it (or any participation therein arising pursuant to
subsection 13.15
) then due and owing, or interest thereon, such benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other Lenders Loans or the Reimbursement Obligations owing to it, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefited Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders;
provided
,
however
, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefited Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest; and
provided
further
that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of
subsection 2.19
and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff
.
(b)
    
In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any Affiliate, branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
13.8.
    
Counterparts.
This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including by facsimile transmission or in electronic (i.e., pdf or tif) format), and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
13.9.
    
Severability.
Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.
Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this
subsection 13.9
, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lenders, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.
13.10.
    
Integration.
This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the agreement of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or warranties by the Administrative Agent or any Lender relative to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the other Loan Documents.

Each such Lender will immediately transfer to the appropriate Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, the amount(s) of its participation(s), and the proceeds of such participation(s) shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent to each relevant Lender in the amount(s) provided for in the preceding sentence.
(c)
    
To the extent any Non-Excluded Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable by a Lender to another Lender in connection with its participating interest in any Converted Loan, the Borrower shall be required to pay increased amounts to the Lender receiving such payments to the same extent they would be required under
subsection 3.10
if the Borrower were making payments directly to such Lender.
(d)
    
Any time when the actions contemplated by paragraph (a) or (b) of this
subsection 13.15
have been taken, upon the notice of any Lender to the Borrower the following shall occur (which notice shall not be required to be declared at any time an Event of Default under
subsection 10(g)
has occurred): (i) the Borrower (through the guarantee contained in
Section 12
) shall automatically be deemed to have assumed the Local Currency Loans which are Converted Loans in which such Lender holds a
participation, and (ii) such Local Currency Loans shall be assigned by the relevant Lender holding such Local Currency Loans or obligations to the Lender who gave the notice requesting such assumption by the Borrower.
(e)
    
If a Defaulting Lender exists on the Conversion Date, the Administrative Agent may, in consultation with one or more other Revolving Lenders which are not Defaulting Lenders, revise this
subsection 13.15
and related definitions in order to allocate payments for the benefit of such Defaulting Lender in a manner consistent with
subsection 2.19
.
13.16.
    
Judgment.
(a)
    
If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in one currency into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency in the city in which it normally conducts its foreign exchange operation for the first currency on the Business Day preceding the day on which final judgment is given.
(b)
    
The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any sum due from it to any Lender hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the 
Judgment Currency
) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the 
Agreement Currency
), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency such Lender may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees notwithstanding any such judgment to indemnify such Lender against such loss, and if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to any Lender, such Lender agrees to remit to the Borrower such excess.
13.17.
    
WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.
13.18.
    
USA Patriot Act Notice.
Each Lender and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the 
Patriot Act
), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that
identifies the Borrower and each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower and each Foreign Subsidiary Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act.
13.19.
    
No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility
. In connection with all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates understanding, that: (a) (i) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers are arms-length commercial transactions between the Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers, on the other hand, (ii) the Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (iii) the Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (b) (i) the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers each is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Borrower or any of its respective Affiliates, or any other Person and (ii) neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arrangers has any obligation to the Borrower or any of its respective Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (c) the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent nor the Arrangers has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates.

FORM OF GUARANTEE
FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and in consideration of credit and/or financial accommodation heretofore or hereafter from time to time made or granted to Boston Scientific Corporation and its subsidiaries pursuant to that Credit Agreement, dated as of April 18, 2012 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the 
Credit Agreement
; capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meaning set forth in the Credit Agreement), among Boston Scientific Corporation, the other banks and financial institutions from time to time parties thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, by the Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement), the undersigned Guarantor (whether one or more the 
Guarantor
, and if more than one jointly and severally) hereby furnishes its guarantee of the Obligations and agrees with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the 
Administrative Agent
) for the Lenders, as follows:
1.1    Guarantee.
(a)    The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors, endorsees, transferees and assigns, the prompt and complete payment and performance by the Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder at any time shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code) or any comparable provisions of any similar federal or state law.
(b)    No payment or payments made by the Guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from the Guarantor or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or appropriation or application, at any time or from time to time, in reduction of or in payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of the Guarantor hereunder which shall, notwithstanding any such payment or payments, remain liable hereunder for the Obligations until the Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated.
(c)    The Guarantor agrees that whenever, at any time, or from time to time, it shall make any payment to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of its liability hereunder, it will notify the Administrative Agent and such Lender in writing that such payment is made under this Guarantee for such purpose.
1.2    No Subrogation
. Notwithstanding any payment or payments made by the Guarantor hereunder, or any set-off or application of funds of the Guarantor by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, the Guarantor shall not be entitled to be subrogated to any of the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower or the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers or against any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Obligations, nor shall the Guarantor seek or be entitled to seek any contribution or reimbursement from the Borrower or the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers in respect of payments made by the Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to the Administrative Agent and the Local Currency Lenders by the Borrower and the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers on account of the Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all of the Obligations shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall be held by the Guarantor in trust for the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, segregated from other funds of the Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by the Guarantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by the Guarantor (duly indorsed by the Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as Administrative Agent may determine. The provisions of this paragraph shall continue to be effective after the termination of the Credit Agreement, the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of the Commitments.
1.3    Amendments, etc. with respect to the Obligations; Waiver of Rights
. The Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against the Guarantor, and without notice to or further assent by the Guarantor, any demand for payment of any of the Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and any of the Obligations continued, and the Obligations, or the liability of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, and any Loan Documents and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, in accordance with the provisions thereof as the Administrative Agent (or the requisite Lenders, as the case may be) may deem advisable from time to time, and any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. None of the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security for the Obligations or for the Credit Agreement or any property subject thereto. When making any demand hereunder against the Guarantor, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar demand on the Borrower, the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers or any other guarantor, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make any such demand or to collect any payments from the Borrower, a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower or any such other guarantor or any release of the Borrower, a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower or such other guarantor shall not relieve the Guarantor of its obligations or liabilities hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, express
or implied, or as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Guarantor. For the purposes hereof demand shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.
1.4    Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional
. The Guarantor waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the Credit Agreement or acceptance of the Credit Agreement or this Guarantee; the Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon the Credit Agreement and this Guarantee; and all dealings between the Borrower or the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon the Credit Agreement and this Guarantee. The Guarantor waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or nonpayment to or upon the Borrower or the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers and the Guarantor with respect to the Obligations. This Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity, regularity or enforceability of this Guarantee, any other Loan Document, any of the Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be asserted by the Borrower or the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers against the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (c) any law, regulation, decree or order of any jurisdiction, or any other event, affecting the Obligations or any Lenders rights with respect thereto, including, without limitation: (i) the application of any such law, regulation, decree or order, including any prior approval, that would prevent the exchange of a non-Dollar currency for Dollars or the remittance of funds outside of such jurisdiction or the unavailability of Dollars in any legal exchange market in such jurisdiction in accordance with normal commercial practice; or (ii) a declaration of banking moratorium or any suspension of payments by banks in such jurisdiction or the imposition by such jurisdiction or any governmental authority thereof of any moratorium on the required rescheduling or restructuring of, or required approval of payments on, any indebtedness in such jurisdiction; or (iii) any expropriation, confiscation, nationalization or requisition by such country or any governmental authority that directly or indirectly deprives the companies in such jurisdiction of any payment obligation under the Obligations; or (iv) any war (whether or not declared), insurrection, revolution, hostile act, civil strife or similar events occurring in such jurisdiction that has the same effect as the events described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above (in each of the cases contemplated in clauses (i) through (iv) above, to the extent occurring or existing on or at any time after the date of this Guarantee), or (d) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of the Borrower or the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers or the Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower or the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers for the Obligations, or of the Guarantor under this Guarantee, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against the Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrower or the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers or any other Person or
against any collateral security or guarantee for the Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from the Guarantor or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of the Borrower or the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers or any such other Person or of any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve the Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Guarantor. This Guarantee shall remain in full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its terms upon the Guarantor and its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and their respective successors, endorsees, transferees and assigns, until all the Obligations and the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guarantee shall have been satisfied by payment in full and the Commitments shall be terminated, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of the Credit Agreement the Borrower or the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers may be free from any Obligations.
1.5    Reinstatement
. This Guarantee shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Guarantor or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.
1.6    Payments
. The Guarantor hereby agrees that all payments required to be made by it hereunder will be made to the Administrative Agent without set-off or counterclaim in accordance with the terms of the Obligations, including, without limitation, in the currency in which payment is due and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Guarantor will comply with the provisions of
subsection 3.10
of the Credit Agreement to the same extent as the Borrower, provided that if a payment is due in a currency other than Dollars and/or at a place other than the United States, and such payment is not made as and when agreed, the Guarantor will, upon the Administrative Agents request, either (i) make payment in such non- Dollar currency and at the place where such payment is payable or (ii) pay the Administrative Agent in Dollars at the Administrative Agents office referred in
Subsection 13.2
of the Credit Agreement. In the event of a payment pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Guarantor will pay the Administrative Agent the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such payment on the date the Guarantor makes such payment.
1.7    Lenders
. For all purposes of this Guarantee, the term Lenders shall be deemed to include Local Currency Lenders.
1.8    Representations and Warranties

Without limitation on any other obligations of the Guarantor or remedies of the Agents or the Lenders under this Guarantee, the Guarantor shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify, defend and save and hold harmless the Agents and the Lenders from and against, and shall pay on demand, any and all damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses and the allocated cost and disbursements of internal legal counsel) that may be suffered or incurred by the Lenders and Agents in connection with or as a result of any failure of any Obligations to be the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their terms. The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and termination of this Guarantee.
