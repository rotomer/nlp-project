The consolidated financial statements of Buyer included in all Public Documents, including any amendments thereto, (a) were prepared from the books and records of Buyer in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby (except as otherwise noted therein), (b) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (c) fairly present in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of the Buyer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the periods covered thereby. To Buyer's knowledge, since the date of the most recent filing by or with respect to Buyer or its Affiliates with the SEC, there has not occurred any event that (singly or together with other such events) would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Buyer other than those resulting from general changes in coal prices; general changes in industry, economic or political conditions; civil unrest, insurrection, outbreaks of hostilities, acts of terrorism or similar events; or changes in Laws and Regulations. 20
Section 4.7 No Undisclosed Liabilities Except to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto of Buyer in the Public Documents or otherwise disclosed in the Public Documents, none of Buyer or its subsidiaries has any material liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a balance sheet or in the notes thereto, other than those incurred in the normal course of business since September 30, 2002, in each case subject to year-end adjustments. Section 4.8 Litigation Except as set forth on Schedule 4.8 or in the Public Documents, there is no action, proceeding, arbitration, investigation or claim pending or, to Buyer's knowledge, threatened, and no basis is known to Buyer for any action, proceeding, arbitration, investigation or claim to which Buyer or its Affiliates is a party and which could reasonably have a material adverse effect on Buyer's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, its results of operations or its financial condition. Section 4.9 Tax Matters (a) (i) All material Tax Returns required to be filed by Buyer have been, or will be, filed in a timely manner and all such Tax Returns are complete and correct; (ii) all material Taxes required to be paid or withheld by Buyer have been, or will be, timely paid or withheld in full by Buyer; (iii) no deficiencies for any Taxes have been asserted or assessed against Buyer which remain unpaid; (iv) no claim has been made by any taxing authority in any jurisdiction where Buyer does not file Tax Returns that may subject Buyer to taxation or the requirement to file a Tax Return in that jurisdiction; and (v) there is no pending dispute over any Taxes imposed with respect to Buyer or any Tax Return filed by Buyer. (b) Since their formation, each of Buyer and each Operating Partnership (as defined below) (i) has been treated as a partnership or has been disregarded as an entity for federal income tax purposes, (ii) will at, and immediately after, the Closing be a partnership or be disregarded as an entity for federal income tax purposes and (iii) would immediately after the Closing not be treated as an investment company (within the meaning of section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) if it were a corporation for federal income tax purposes. As used herein, "Operating Partnerships" means each of the following: Penn Virginia Operating Co., LLC and all other limited liability company operating subsidiaries of Buyer. (c) The Section 2.3 Borrowing will be a nonrecourse liability of Buyer within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-1(a)(2). Buyer does not anticipate that PNRC's share, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5(a)(2)), of the Section 2.3 Borrowing will be reduced after the Closing as part of a plan, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5(a)(3), that has as one of its purposes minimizing the extent to which PNRC recognizes income on MLP's assumption of the PNRC Notes; provided, however, Buyer's intent to amortize the Section 2.3 Borrowing or any refinancing of that borrowing in accordance with its terms or the issuance of equity to the public shall not be a breach of this representation. 21
Section 4.10 Employees Buyer has no employees. Section 4.11 Financing Buyer has sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds (in United States dollars) to enable it to pay the Cash Portion at the Closing and to effect the transaction that is described in Section 2.3.

Section 4.13 Reliance of Seller Group Any due diligence or other investigation by or on behalf of Seller Group shall not affect its reliance or right to rely on any representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement. ARTICLE V COVENANTS Section 5.1 Access to Information All information relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement provided by any Party or its Affiliates to any other Party, its Affiliates or its or their authorized representatives (whether furnished before or after the date of this Agreement) shall be held subject to the confidentiality agreement between Buyer and Parent, dated as of April 29, 2002 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Seller Group hereby agrees to provide Buyer and its accountants (i) on or before February 1, 2003, with the tax basis of the PNRC Contributed Assets as of the date of the Closing Date and (ii) all information reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the preparation of its tax returns or the payment of its taxes that relate to the PNRC Contributed Assets and that is in the possession of the Seller Parties. Section 5.2 Financial Statements Buyer and Seller Group acknowledge that Seller Group is conveying to Buyer certain specified assets, and Seller Group has advised Buyer that Seller Group does not prepare financial statements relating to such assets. Nevertheless, if Buyer is advised by the SEC that audited financial statements of all or part of the Assets are required by Regulation S-X, Seller Group, if requested by Buyer, shall, at Buyer's sole expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its auditors to audit and perform interim procedures in accordance with GAAP and in accordance 22
with Regulation S-X for such Assets for the years ending December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 (the "Audited Financial Statements") and the period ending on the Closing Date. Section 5.3 Public Announcements It is contemplated that immediately following the Closing, each of Buyer and Seller Group will consult with each other regarding the language of and issue a press release or press releases disclosing such action. Section 5.4 Consents (a) Seller Group shall make or cause to be made all filings and obtain all licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities and other third Persons necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Buyer shall cooperate with Seller Group when necessary or applicable. (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller Group shall make or cause to be made all filings with the relevant agency or agencies in the State of New Mexico necessary to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to, obtain the State Lease Consents as soon as possible after the Closing. Section 5.5 Closing Costs; Expenses (a) Seller Group shall pay all Taxes associated with the transfer of the Assets into the Acquisition LLCs. Seller and Buyer shall bear equally any Transfer Taxes (other than Income Taxes) due and payable, if any, in connection with the sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer, and delivery of the Membership Interests from Seller to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. (b) Each of the Parties shall pay its own expenses and the fees and expenses of its counsel, accountants, consultants and other experts and representatives associated with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein. Section 5.6 Taxes (a) Any and all ad valorem taxes, personal property taxes, fees or assessments for the calendar year 2002 due with respect to the Assets, or payable by any of the Seller Parties pursuant to the terms of any leases, subleases, licenses, rights-of-way, instruments, or other agreements by which any of the Seller Parties hold the Reserves or any other of the Assets shall be prorated between the Seller Parties on the one hand and Buyer on the other hand, as of the Closing on a calendar year basis, using the most recent actual or proposed tax rates and assessments by the appropriate Governmental Authority. If any Party shall pay such taxes for which it is entitled to be reimbursed because of such proration, the other party responsible therefor shall promptly reimburse the party so paying upon notice of the amount paid by such Party. Regardless of which Party is responsible, the Seller Parties shall handle the payment to the appropriate Governmental Authority of all Taxes with respect to the Assets which are required to be paid prior to the Closing (and shall file all returns with respect to such Taxes). 23
(b) Buyer shall allocate to PNRC with respect to the Units reverse section 704(c) allocations (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(a)(6)) in accordance with the remedial allocation method of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d) in respect of the difference between the fair market value of the assets held by Buyer and its operating subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (the "Existing Buyer Assets") and Buyer's carrying value in the Existing Buyer Assets immediately prior to the Closing. For such purposes, the fair market value of the assets of Buyer shall be the amount that Buyer uses to calculate adjustments under Section 743 of the Code. (c) Each Seller agrees that it and its Affiliates will not take any action that would cause either of the Acquisition LLCs to be classified as a corporation for any federal, state or local income tax purpose. Buyer agrees that it and its Affiliates will not take any action that would cause either of the Acquisition LLCs to be classified as a corporation for any federal, state or local income tax purpose before or on the Closing Date. (d) Except as may be required by a change in applicable law, the parties hereto agree to report the transactions for which provision is made in this Agreement for federal income tax purposes as follows: (i) Acquisition No. 1 LLC and Acquisition No. 2 LLC are disregarded for federal income tax purposes. (ii) The sale by EACC and the purchase by Buyer of the membership interests in Acquisition No 1 LLC that is to occur pursuant to Section 2.2(a) hereof is the sale by EACC and the purchase by Buyer of the assets of Acquisition No 1 LLC in exchange for $40,000,000 cash. (iii) The transfer by PNRC to Buyer of the membership interests in Acquisition No 2 LLC that is to occur pursuant to Section 2.2(b) hereof is the transfer by PNRC to Buyer of the assets (the "No 2 LLC Assets") of Acquisition No 2 LLC in exchange for 1,522,325 Common Units, 1,240,833 Class B Common Units and the assumption by Buyer of the PNRC Notes. Such transfer is divided into two transactions that are as follows: (A) A sale by PNRC and a purchase by Buyer of a Taxable Fraction undivided interest in the No. 2 LLC Assets in exchange for the assumption by Buyer of debt in an amount equal to the product of (1) 1.0 minus the PNRC Debt Share and (2) the aggregate stated principal amount of the PNRC Notes. (B) The contribution by PNRC of a Non Taxable Fraction undivided interest in the No. 2 Assets (the "PNRC Contributed Assets") to Buyer in exchange for (1) the assumption by Buyer of debt in an amount equal to the product of (x) the PNRC Debt Share and (y) the aggregate stated principal amount of the PNRC Notes and (2) the Units. Such contribution is a non taxable transaction that is described in Section 721(a) of the Code and to which Section 707(a)(2) of the Code does not apply. For purposes hereof, 24
"FMV PNRC Units" means the product of (a) the number of Units that PNRC is to receive pursuant to the provisions hereof and (b) the average of the high and low price of the Common Units on the New York Stock Exchange on the Closing Date as shown in The Wall Street Journal (Northeast edition). "Non Taxable Fraction" means (a) the sum of (1) the PNRC Debt Share multiplied by the aggregate stated principal amount of the PNRC Notes and (2) FMV PNRC Units divided by (b) the sum of the aggregate stated principal amount of the PNRC Notes and FMV PNRC Units. "PNRC Debt Share" means (a) 98% multiplied by (b) (1) the sum of 1,522,325 and 1,240,833 divided by (2) the sum of 1,240,833 and the number of MLP Common Units that are outstanding immediately after the Closing. "Taxable Fraction" means 1.0 less the Non Taxable Fraction. (iv) The payment of the PNRC Notes that is to occur pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof is a refinancing, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5(c), of the PNRC Notes with the proceeds of an obligation of Buyer that is a nonrecourse obligation, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.752-1(a)(2), of Buyer. Any party hereto that determines that a change in applicable law has occurred that prevents it from so reporting the transactions for which provision is made in this Agreement shall, prior to reporting the transactions in a different manner, obtain a written opinion of tax counsel at its expense to the effect that one or more of the provisions of the foregoing may not be included on its federal income tax return by reason of such change in applicable law, shall provide a copy of such written opinion to the other parties hereto, and shall discuss in good faith with the other parties the positions that such opinion concludes cannot be taken under applicable law. Thereafter, the party that has so obtained the written opinion and any other party hereto may file its federal income tax return with the variations from the foregoing agreement that are described in such written opinion as not permitted by reason of such change in applicable law. Moreover, each of the parties hereto agrees to report the transactions for which provision is made in this Agreement in the manner that is set out above for all state and local income tax purposes unless it obtains a written opinion of tax counsel at its expense that one or more of the provisions of the foregoing may not be included on its return under then applicable law, shall provide a copy of such written opinion to the other parties hereto, and shall discuss in good faith with the other parties the positions that such opinion concludes cannot be taken under applicable law. Thereafter, the party that has so obtained the written opinion and any other party hereto may file its state and local income tax returns with the variations from the foregoing agreement that are described in such written opinion as not being permitted under then applicable law (e) Buyer agrees that PNRC shall be allocated income in accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code utilizing the remedial allocation method of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-3(d) in respect of the difference between the fair market value and PNRC's adjusted tax basis in the PNRC Contributed Assets on the Closing Date and that such income allocation shall be 25
calculated as though (i) the IRC Section 704(b) book value of the PNRC Contributed Assets immediately after the Closing were the sum of (A) FMV PNRC Units and (B) the Non Taxable Fraction of the aggregate stated principal amount of the PNRC Notes and (ii) the PNRC Contributed Assets contained a total number of tons that is equal to the product of the Non Taxable Fraction multiplied by the total estimated recoverable tons of the No. 2 LLC Assets (which is 80,000,000 at the time of the Closing). Buyer agrees to adjust its estimate of the remaining total reserves recoverable from the PNRC Contributed Assets for purposes of this Section 5.6(e) by reason of actual production therefrom and otherwise only in accordance with prudent coal mining practices. (f) Buyer agrees that PNRC shall not be allocated income by reason of Section 704(c) of the Code in respect of any PNRC Contributed Asset other than as described in Section 5.6(e) hereof as portions of the Reserves are mined from the PNRC Contributed Assets or from any Reserves that are transferred in exchange for any PNRC Contributed Assets (also, in this Section 5.6(f) "PNRC Contributed Assets"), and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as provided in Section 5.6(g) below, Buyer agrees that there will be no sale, exchange or transfer of any PNRC Contributed Asset or any portion thereof after which income is allocated to PNRC by reason of Section 704(c) of the Code in excess of the amount of income that would be allocated to PNRC if Buyer held each PNRC Contributed Asset as such asset was mined to exhaustion; provided, however, this Section 5.6(f) shall not apply to any sale, exchange, or transfer of any PNRC Contributed Asset or portion thereof (i) to any of the Seller Parties pursuant to Article IX of this Agreement or (ii) pursuant to the Reserve Substitution Agreement, provided that, Buyer has not placed the property to be substituted up for sale; provided further, however, neither the existence of the Reserve Substitution Agreement nor the exercise of any of the rights thereunder shall be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the property has been put up for sale. (g) Buyer further agrees that if it sells, exchanges, or transfers any of the PNRC Contributed Assets (other than pursuant to the proviso in Section 5.6(f)), then Buyer shall pay to PNRC an amount that is equal to the Clause (ii) Present Value (as defined below) reduced by the Clause (i) Present Value (as defined below) on the 60th day after the sale, exchange or transfer that caused such breach. (i) The amount of taxable income that would be allocated to PNRC by reason of Section 704(c) of the Code in respect of the PNRC Contributed Assets if such breach had not occurred shall be determined based on the mining plan for the Lee Ranch Mine that is attached hereto as Schedule 3.13(c) for each calendar year (the "Closing Date Mining Plan") that is not ended at the time at which the sale, exchange or transfer occurs and the income taxes that would be payable by reason of such taxable income shall be determined as 38 percent of such taxable income and shall be assumed to be payable by PNRC on the March 15 following the end of each such calendar year. The "Clause (i) Present Value" is the sum of the present values of such assumed tax payments on the 60th day after such breach using a discount rate of six percent per annum with annual compounding. As an illustration of the calculation of "present value" at an interest rate of six percent per annum with annual compounding, the present value of a payment that is to be made 2 years and 150 days after such 60th day is the product of (a) the amount of such 26
payment divided by (b) the product of (x) 1.0 + (150/365) x .06, (y) 1.06 and (z) 1.06. It is assumed for the purposes of this Agreement that each year has 365 days. (ii) The taxable income that is allocable to PNRC by reason of IRC Section 704(c) after such breach in respect of the PNRC Contributed Assets that are retained by Buyer shall then be determined based on the Closing Date Mining Plan and the income taxes that would be payable by reason of such taxable income shall be determined as 38 percent of such taxable income and shall be assumed to be payable by PNRC on the March 15 following the end of each such calendar year. The "Clause (ii) Present Value" is the sum of the present values of such assumed tax payments on the 60th day after such breach using a discount rate of six percent per annum with annual compounding. The Closing Date Mining Plan shall not be changed for any reason for purposes of this Section 5.6(g). (h) Buyer agrees to give PNRC notice promptly of any adjustment in the Section 2.3 Borrowing that will reduce PNRC's share for purposes of Section 752 of the Code, except in the case of an amortization of the Section 2.3 Borrowing or any refinancing thereof in accordance with its terms or any issuance of its equity securities and the application of the proceeds. PNRC agrees to provide Buyer after inquiry from Buyer with PNRC's adjusted basis in Buyer from time to time. Buyer shall be under no obligation to determine PNRC's adjusted basis in Buyer. Section 5.7 Preparation of Proxy As promptly as possible (but no later than one hundred twenty (120) days) following the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement soliciting the approval of the holders of the Common Units of Buyer (the "Unitholders") in favor of conversion of the Class B Common Units to Common Units (the "Conversion"). If the Conversion is not approved at the special meeting called to approve the Conversion, upon the expiration of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the Special Meeting in which the Conversion was not approved, Seller may, by written notice, require Buyer to prepare and file with the SEC an additional proxy statement soliciting the approval of the Unitholders in favor of the Conversion; provided, however, that Seller shall in no event exercise this right prior to December 19, 2003. Buyer agrees to engage a proxy solicitor, at Buyer's expense, in connection with each proxy statement to solicit the affirmative votes of the Unitholders in favor of the Conversion, and to take all other necessary and appropriate action to support the Conversion. Section 5.8 Option Agreement; Other Oil and Gas Operations (a) Santa Fe Energy Company ("SFR") and Santa Fe Pacific Mining, Inc. ("Pacific"), were the original parties to that certain Lease Option Agreement (the "Option Agreement") dated October 8, 1987 whereunder SFR has an option, exercisable by written notice (the "Option Notice") to Pacific until October 8, 2007, to acquire for itself or third parties (a "Third Party") oil and gas leases on lands subject to the Option Agreement and certain rights to explore for hydrocarbons on the lands subject to the Option Agreement. PNRC has succeeded to the rights 27
of Pacific in the Option Agreement. PNRC agrees that (i) in the event it receives an Option Notice, it will promptly forward a copy of the Option Notice to Buyer and (ii) it will exercise and enforce its rights under the Option Agreement to restrict SFR or any Third Party from obtaining any lease on lands located over the Reserves owned by Buyer or its Affiliates unless otherwise consented to in writing by Buyer. (b) Seller Group agrees that it will not, and it will not permit its existing lessees, licensees and assignees or agents to conduct exploration, development, drilling or mining operations for oil, gas, coal bed methane or any reserved minerals (collectively, the "Other Minerals") in a manner that will adversely affect any active coal mining operations on Lee Ranch Reserves (as the same may be substituted from time to time) in any material respect. Seller Group agrees that Buyer's rights to have the coal mined, removed and developed from the Lee Ranch Reserves shall be superior to the rights reserved by Seller Group with respect to Other Minerals. Seller Group agrees that it will not enter into any leases or other agreements in the future granting any other Third Party the right to, explore, develop, drill or mine for Other Minerals in a manner that will adversely affect any active coal mining operations on Lee Ranch Reserves (as the same may be substituted from time to time) in any material respect. Section 5.9 Further Assurances At or after the Closing, each Party, at the request of any other Party, will execute and deliver to the requesting Party all such further assignments, deeds, agreements, contracts, instruments and other documents as the requesting Party may reasonably request in order to perform, accomplish, perfect or record, if reasonably necessary, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to otherwise carry out the intention of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Seller Group's obtaining the releases of any Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances) on the Assets existing as of the Closing Date without regard to any limitations contained in Section 7.2(b) for a period of two years from the Closing Date.

Buyer agrees that the indemnification provided in this Section 7.2 is the exclusive remedy for a breach by Seller Group of the items listed in (i), (ii) and (iii) above of this paragraph; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall affect Buyer's right to recover under the Special Warranty Deeds.

Seller agrees that the indemnification provided in this Section 7.3 is the exclusive remedy for a breach by Buyer of the items listed in (i) and (ii) above of this paragraph. (b) Buyer's obligations to indemnify Seller Indemnitees pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i) hereof are subject to the following limitations: (i) No indemnification shall be made by Buyer with respect to any claim (other than the right to indemnification for a breach of the representations under Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.12, which shall not be limited as to the amount of the claim or the time at which any claim may be brought under this Agreement) unless the aggregate amount of Seller Damages under all claims under this Article VII exceeds an amount equal to $500,000 and then only to the extent of such Seller Damages exceed $500,000. (ii) Buyer shall be obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees only for those claims giving rise to Seller Damages for which the Seller Indemnitees have given Buyer written notice thereof prior to the end of the applicable Indemnity Period in the event that an Indemnity Period applies to such Seller Damages. Any written notice delivered by a Seller Indemnitee to Buyer with respect to Seller Damages shall set forth 32
with as much specificity as is reasonably practicable the basis of the claim for Seller Damages and, to the extent reasonably practicable, a reasonable estimate of the amount thereof. Section 7.4 Third Party Indemnification The obligations of any indemnifying Person to indemnify any indemnified Person under this Article VII with respect to Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, as the case may be, resulting from the assertion of liability by third Persons (a "Claim"), will be subject to the following terms and conditions: (a) Any Persons against whom any Claim is asserted will give the indemnifying Person written notice of any such Claim (which notice shall include reasonably specified details regarding such Claim, an estimate of the Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, as applicable, and the specific basis under this Agreement for such Claim) promptly after learning of such Claim, and the indemnifying Person may at its option undertake the defense thereof by counsel of its own choosing (which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Person being indemnified); provided, however, the indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in any matter through counsel of its own choosing at its own expense; provided further, however, that the indemnifying Person shall pay the fees and expenses of separate counsel for the indemnified Person if (i) the indemnifying Person has agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (ii) the named parties to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified Person and the indemnifying Person, and such indemnified Person shall have been advised by counsel that the representation of both parties would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them (in which case, if such indemnified Person notifies the indemnifying Person in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying Person, the indemnifying Person shall not have the right to assume the defense of such Claim on behalf of such indemnified Person; it being understood, however, that the indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for such indemnified Person, which firm shall be designated in writing by such indemnified Person). Failure to give prompt notice of a Claim hereunder shall not affect the indemnifying Person's obligations under this Article VII, except to the extent that the indemnifying Person is materially prejudiced by such failure to give prompt notice. If the indemnifying Person elects to assume the defense of the Claim, the indemnified Person shall provide the indemnifying Person with reasonable access to its records and personnel relating to such Claim and shall otherwise cooperate with the indemnifying Person in the defense or settlement of the Claim. If the indemnifying Person, within thirty (30) days after notice of any such Claim, fails to assume the defense of such Claim, or thereafter fails to diligently defend such Claim, the indemnified Person against whom such Claim has been made will (upon further written notice to the indemnifying Person) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk, and at the expense, of the indemnifying Person. (b) Anything in this Section 7.4 to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the indemnified Person shall not settle, compromise or pay a claim for which it is indemnified without the prior 33
written consent of the indemnifying Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (ii) the indemnifying Person shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of any action, suit or proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment for other than monetary damages to be borne by the indemnifying Person, without the prior written consent of the indemnified Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. ARTICLE VIII AMENDMENT AND WAIVER The Parties may (a) amend this Agreement, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the Parties, (c) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (d) waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions contained herein, in each case only by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each Party. ARTICLE IX CHANGE OF CONTROL; RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER Section 9.1 Change of Control (a) For so long as any of the Leases (or any amendments thereof or substitutes therefor) are in force, promptly, but in no event more than ten days after the earlier of (X) the execution of a definitive agreement contemplating a Change of Control (as defined below) or (Y) the occurrence of a Change of Control, Buyer shall give Seller Group written notice of such event (a "Change of Control Notice"). Seller Group shall have the right, unless waived by Seller Group, exercisable by written notice to Buyer (an "Acceptance Notice") within 30 days after receipt of the Change of Control Notice, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Assets subject to a Lease with Affiliates of Seller Group and that are then owned by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, as such Assets then exist, free and clear of Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances (the "Then-Existing Assets"), in its own name or through one or more designated Affiliates by payment of immediately available funds of the Change of Control Price (as defined below) as of the date of closing of the transaction constituting a Change of Control (the "Change of Control Date") on the later of (x) the Change of Control Date or (y) ten days after the determination of the Change of Control Price (the later of (x) or (y), the "Purchase Date"). (b) If Seller Group exercises its rights as provided in Section 9.1(a), Seller Group shall be obligated to purchase the then-Existing Assets on the Purchase Date at the Change of Control Price and on otherwise substantially the same terms provided in this Agreement for the purchase of the Assets by Buyer at the Closing by payment of immediately available funds and the Reserve Substitution Agreement and the Leases shall terminate as provided therein. (c) If Seller Group exercises its rights under Section 9.1(a), Buyer and Seller Group shall cooperate in good faith and enter into the appropriate agreements and make required deliveries to effect the transfer of title to the Then-Existing Assets to Seller Group as 34
contemplated by Section 9.1(a) and to otherwise cooperate to effect such transfer in a tax-efficient manner for Buyer and Seller Group. (d) If prior to the expiration of the Negotiation Period, Buyer and Seller Group are unable to agree on the Change of Control Price or either Buyer or Seller Group desires not to negotiate with the other, each Party shall appoint an Eligible Investment Bank of its choice within five days after the Negotiation Period (as defined below). The two Eligible Investment Banks appointed by the respective Parties shall appoint a third Eligible Investment Bank not later than five days after such two Eligible Investment Banks have been so appointed. Within 20 days from the appointment of the third Eligible Investment Bank, each Eligible Investment Bank appointed as aforesaid shall provide the Parties with a written valuation, with appropriate documentation, setting forth its valuation of the Fair Market Value in U.S. dollars, of the then expected remaining royalty income stream attributable to the Then-Existing Assets at the per ton royalty amounts set forth in the Leases (or any amendments thereof or substitutes therefor) to be paid to Buyer thereunder. The Change of Control Price shall be the average of the two highest valuations; provided, however, that for purposes of calculating the average, the highest valuation shall in no event be deemed to be more than 10% above the second highest valuation. The determination of the Change of Control Price pursuant to this Section 9.3(d) shall be final and binding on the Parties, and shall not be appealable. Each Party shall be responsible for the costs and expenses of its Eligible Investment Bank appointee, and the costs of the third Eligible Investment Bank shall be shared equally by the Parties. (e) For the purposes of this Agreement, "Change of Control" shall occur if: (i) any "person" or "group" (within the meaning of Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act), other than Seller Group or any of their Affiliates, becomes the "beneficial owner(s)" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) of equity securities of (A) Penn Virginia Corporation, a Virginia corporation ("PVA") (other than a wholly-owned Subsidiary of PVA), which entitle the holder thereof to control more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of PVA, (B) the General Partner (other than a Subsidiary of PVA) which entitles the holder thereof to control more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of the General Partner, or (C) the Buyer (other than a Subsidiary of PVA) which entitle the holder thereof to control more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of Common Units and Parity Units (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) of Buyer; (ii) the equity security holders of PVA or Buyer approve a merger, reorganization, consolidation, exchange of equity interests, recapitalization, restructuring or other business combination which results in beneficial ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of PVA or Buyer being transferred to a Person or Persons other than PVA or any of its Subsidiaries or Seller Group or any of their Affiliates, unless the equity securityholders of PVA or Buyer, as applicable, immediately before such transaction beneficially own, directly or indirectly, immediately following such transaction, at least a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the Person resulting from such transaction or the Person acquiring such properties and assets, entitled to vote generally on the election of such resulting or acquiring Person's directors, in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of such equity securities immediately before such transaction; (iii) there occurs a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of PVA or Buyer to a Person other than Seller Group 35

"Change of Control Price" shall mean the price agreed upon between Buyer and Seller Group prior to the expiration of Negotiation Period; provided, however, that if Buyer and Seller Group are unable to agree within the Negotiation Period or either Buyer or Seller Group desires not to negotiate with the other, the Change of Control Price shall mean the Fair Market Value, as determined in accordance with Section 9.1(d). "Continuing Directors" shall mean, with respect to a Person, (x) all individuals constituting the board of directors of such Person as of the date of this Agreement, (y) all individuals hereafter designated as nominees for election to the board of directors of such Person by a majority of the Continuing Directors who were members of such board of directors at the time of such nomination or election and (z) all individuals hereinafter designated as nominees to the board of directors of such Person by Seller or any of its Affiliates.
