SECTION 2. Representations, Warranties and Agreements of the Selling Stockholders. Each Selling Stockholder severally represents, warrants and agrees that: (a) The Selling Stockholder has, and immediately prior to the First Delivery Date (as defined in Section 5 hereof) the Selling Stockholder will have full right, power and authority to sell, assign, transfer and deliver the shares of Stock to be sold by the Selling Stockholder hereunder on such date; and upon delivery of such shares and payment therefor pursuant hereto the several Underwriters will acquire a security entitlement with respect to such shares on the Closing Date and no action based on an adverse claim may be asserted against the Underwriters with respect to such shares. 8
(b) The Selling Stockholder has full right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement; the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Selling Stockholder and the consummation by the Selling Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Selling Stockholder is a party or by which the Selling Stockholder is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Selling Stockholder is subject, nor will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of any partnership agreement, certificate of incorporation or deed of trust of the Selling Stockholder or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Selling Stockholder or the property or assets of the Selling Stockholder; and, except for the registration of the Stock under the Securities Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under the Exchange Act and applicable state securities laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Stock by the Underwriters, no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing or registration with, any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Selling Stockholder and the consummation by the Selling Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby. (c) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus and any further amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, when they become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, do not and will not, as of the applicable effective date (as to the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto) and as of the applicable filing date (as to the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto in light of the circumstances in which they were made) contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; provided that this representation and warranty is made only as to information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus under the caption "Selling Stockholders" relating to such Selling Stockholder. (d) The Selling Stockholder has no reason to believe that the representations and warranties of the Company contained in Section 1 hereof are not materially true and correct, is familiar with the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (as amended or supplemented) and has no knowledge of any material fact, condition or information not disclosed in the Registration Statement, as of the effective date, or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in light of the circumstances in which they were made, as of the applicable filing date, which has adversely affected or may adversely affect the business of the Company and is not prompted to sell shares of Common Stock by any information concerning the Company that is not set forth in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. (e) The Selling Stockholder has reviewed the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and, although the Selling Stockholder has not independently verified and is not passing upon and assumes no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or 9
fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, the Selling Stockholder has no reason to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the effective date thereof, contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, on the date thereof or on the date hereof, contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact or necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. (f) The Selling Stockholder has not taken and will not take, directly or indirectly, any action which is designed to or which has constituted or which might reasonably be expected to cause or result in the stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the shares of the Stock. SECTION 3. Purchase of the Stock by the Underwriters. On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, this Agreement, the Selling Stockholders hereby agree to sell 5,400,000 shares of the Firm Stock to the several Underwriters and each of the Underwriters, severally and not jointly, agrees to purchase the number of shares of the Firm Stock set forth opposite that Underwriter's name in Schedule 1 hereto. Each Underwriter shall be obligated to purchase from each Selling Stockholder that number of shares of the Firm Stock that represents the same proportion of the number of shares of Firm Stock to be sold, as the number of shares of the Firm Stock set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto represents of the total number of shares of the Firm Stock to be purchased by all of the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement. The respective purchase obligations of the Underwriters with respect to the Firm Stock shall be rounded among the Underwriters to avoid fractional shares, as the Representatives may determine. In addition, on the basis of the representations and warranties contained in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, this Agreement, the Selling Stockholders grant to the Underwriters an option to purchase up to 810,000 shares of Option Stock. Such option is granted solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments in the sale of Firm Stock and is exercisable as provided in Section 5 hereof. Shares of Option Stock shall be purchased severally for the account of the Underwriters in proportion to the number of shares of Firm Stock set forth opposite the name of such Underwriters in Schedule 1 hereto. The respective purchase obligations of each Underwriter with respect to the Option Stock shall be adjusted by the Representatives so that no Underwriter shall be obligated to purchase Option Stock other than in 100 share amounts. The price of both the Firm Stock and any Option Stock shall be $30.267 per share. The Selling Stockholders shall not be obligated to deliver any of the Stock to be delivered on any Delivery Date (as hereinafter defined), except upon payment for all the Stock to be purchased on such Delivery Date as provided herein. 10
SECTION 4. Offering of Stock by the Underwriters. Upon authorization by the Representatives of the release of the Firm Stock, the several Underwriters propose to offer the Firm Stock for sale upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus. SECTION 5. Delivery of and Payment for the Stock. Delivery of and payment for the Firm Stock shall be made at the offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10153, at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the fourth full business day following the date of this Agreement or at such other date or place as shall be determined by agreement between the Representatives and the Company. This date and time are sometimes referred to as the "FIRST DELIVERY DATE." On the First Delivery Date, the Selling Stockholders shall deliver or cause to be delivered security entitlements with respect to the Firm Stock to the Representatives for the account of each Underwriter against payment to or upon the order of the Selling Stockholders of the purchase price by wire transfer in immediately available funds. Time shall be of the essence, and delivery at the time and place specified pursuant to this Agreement is a further condition of the obligation of each Underwriter hereunder. Upon delivery, the Firm Stock shall be registered in such names and in such denominations as the Representatives shall request in writing not less than two full business days prior to the First Delivery Date. The option granted in Section 3 will expire 30 days after the date of this Agreement and may be exercised in whole or in part from time to time but in no event more than twice, by written notice being given to the Company and the Selling Stockholders by the Representatives. Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of shares of Option Stock as to which the option is being exercised, the names in which the shares of Option Stock are to be registered, the denominations in which the shares of Option Stock are to be issued and the date and time, as determined by the Representatives, when the shares of Option Stock are to be delivered; provided, however, that this date and time shall not be earlier than the First Delivery Date nor earlier than the second business day after the date on which the option shall have been exercised nor later than the fifth business day after the date on which the option shall have been exercised. The date and time the shares of Option Stock are delivered are sometimes referred to as a "SECOND DELIVERY DATE" and the First Delivery Date and any Second Delivery Date are sometimes each referred to as a "DELIVERY DATE." Delivery of security entitlements with respect to and payment for the Option Stock shall be made at the place specified in the first sentence of the first paragraph of this Section 5 (or at such other place as shall be determined by agreement between the Representatives and the Company) at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Second Delivery Date. On such Second Delivery Date, the Selling Stockholders who are selling the Option Stock shall deliver or cause to be delivered the security entitlements with respect to the certificates representing the Option Stock to the Representatives for the account of each Underwriter against payment to or upon the order of such Selling Stockholders of the purchase price by wire transfer in immediately available funds. Time shall be of the essence, and delivery at the time and place specified pursuant to this Agreement is a further condition of the obligation of each Underwriter 11

registration of the Stock under the Securities Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under the Exchange Act and applicable state securities laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Stock by the Underwriters, no consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing or registration with, any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by such Selling Stockholder and the consummation by such Selling Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of each Selling Stockholder; (iii) Immediately prior to the First Delivery Date, each Selling Stockholder had a security entitlement with respect to the shares of Stock to be sold by the Selling Stockholder under this Agreement free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims and full right, power and authority to sell, assign, transfer and deliver such shares to be sold by the Selling Stockholder hereunder; and (iv) A security entitlement with respect to the shares of Stock to be sold by each Selling Stockholder under this Agreement, has been transferred to each of the several Underwriters and no action based on an adverse claim may be asserted against the Underwriters with respect to such offered securities.

Such counsel shall also have furnished to the Representatives a written statement, addressed to the Underwriters and dated the First Delivery Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to the effect that (x) such counsel has acted as counsel to such Selling Stockholder in connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and (y) based on the foregoing, no facts have come to the attention of such counsel that lead it to believe that the Registration Statement, as of the Effective Date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact relating to such Selling Stockholder or omitted to state such a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading, or that the Prospectus contains any untrue statement of a material fact relating to such Selling Stockholder or omits to state such a material fact necessary in 17
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The foregoing opinion and statement may be qualified by a statement to the effect that such counsel does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus. (e) The Representatives shall have received from Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated such Delivery Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Stock, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.

(h) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate, dated such Delivery Date, of its Chairman of the Board, its President or a Vice President and its Chief Financial Officer stating that: 18
(i) The representations, warranties and agreements of the Company in Section 1 are true and correct as of such Delivery Date; the Company has complied in all material respects with all its agreements contained herein; and the conditions set forth in Sections 9(a), 9(j) and 9(k) have been fulfilled; and (ii) They have carefully examined the Registration Statement and the Prospectus and, in their opinion (A) as of the Effective Date, the Registration Statement and Prospectus did not include any untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (with respect to the Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made), and (B) since the Effective Date no event has occurred that should have been set forth in a supplement or amendment to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus. (i) The Selling Stockholders (or one or more attorneys-in-fact on behalf of the Selling Stockholders) shall have furnished to the Representatives on the First Delivery Date a certificate, dated the First Delivery Date, signed by, or on behalf of, the Selling Stockholders (or one or more attorneys-in-fact) stating that the representations, warranties and agreements of the Selling Stockholders contained herein are true and correct as of the First Delivery Date and that the Selling Stockholders have complied with all agreements contained herein to be performed by the Selling Stockholders at or prior to the First Delivery Date.

(k) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) of the Rules and Regulations and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities. 19

All opinions, letters, evidence and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters. SECTION 10. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, its officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage, liability or action relating to purchases and sales of Stock), to which that Underwriter, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained (A) in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (B) in any materials or information provided to investors by, or with the approval of, the Company in connection with the marketing of the offering of the Stock ("MARKETING MATERIALS"), including any road show or investor presentations made to investors by the Company (whether in person or electronically), (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Marketing Materials, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any act or failure to act or any alleged act or failure to act by any Underwriter in connection with, or relating in any manner to, the Stock or the offering contemplated hereby, and that is 20
included as part of or referred to in any loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising out of or based upon matters covered by clause (i) or (ii) above (provided that the Company shall not be liable under this clause (iii) to the extent that it is determined in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such loss, claim, damage, liability or action resulted directly from any such acts or failures to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by such Underwriter through its gross negligence or willful misconduct), and shall reimburse each Underwriter and each such officer, employee or controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by that Underwriter, officer, employee or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action (i) arises out of, or is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of any Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein which information consists solely of the information specified in Section 10(f); or (ii) results solely from an untrue statement of material fact contained in, or the omission of a material fact from, such preliminary prospectus, which untrue statement or omission was corrected in the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) if the Company shall sustain the burden of proving that the Underwriters sold Shares to the person alleging such loss, claim, damage, liability or action without sending or giving, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to the Underwriters within a reasonable amount of time prior to such sale or such confirmation, and the Underwriters failed to deliver the corrected Prospectus, if required by law to have so delivered it and if delivered would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability that the Company may otherwise have to any Underwriter or to any officer, employee or controlling person of that Underwriter. (b) Each Selling Stockholder, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Company and each Underwriter, its officers and employees and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim), or any action in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any loss, claim, damage or liability or action relating to purchases and sales of Stock), to which the Company or that Underwriter, officer, employee or controlling person may become subject, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus, the 21
Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or the omission or alleged omission: (x) relates to information under the caption "Selling Stockholders" relating to such Selling Stockholder; or (y) was made in conformity with written information concerning such Selling Stockholder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of that Selling Stockholder specifically for inclusion therein; provided, however, that the indemnification contained in this paragraph (b) with respect to the Preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of the Company or any Underwriter (or to the benefit of any officers or employees of the Company or any Underwriter or of any person controlling the Company or such Underwriter) on account of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising from the sale of Stock by such Underwriter to any person if the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus and the Underwriter sold Stock to that person without sending or giving at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) if the Company has previously furnished sufficient copies thereof to the Underwriter on a timely basis to permit such sending or giving. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Selling Stockholders may otherwise have to the Company or any Underwriter or any officer, employee or controlling person of the Company or that Underwriter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the liability of each Selling Stockholder under this Section 10(b) to all such indemnified parties and under Section 2(d) shall not exceed the net amount received by each such Selling Stockholder (after deducting any underwriting discount) from the sale of the Stock pursuant to this Agreement. (c) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Selling Stockholders, the Company's officers and employees, each of its directors, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of that Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling 22
person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person. (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 10 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 10, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 10 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 10. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 10 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that the Representatives shall have the right to employ counsel to represent jointly the Representatives and those other Underwriters and their respective officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company or any Selling Stockholder under this Section 10 if, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, it is advisable for the Representatives and those Underwriters, officers, employees and controlling persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company or any Selling Stockholder. No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. 23
(e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 10(a), 10(b) or 10(c) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Stock or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Stock purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the shares of the Stock purchased under this Agreement, on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the Stock under this Agreement, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Selling Stockholders or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 10 were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 10 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 10(e), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10(e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Stock underwritten by it and distributed to the public was offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to 24
contribute as provided in this Section 10(e) are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. (f) The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company acknowledges that the statements with respect to the public offering of the Stock by the Underwriters set forth on the cover page of, the fourth and nineteenth paragraphs appearing under the caption "Underwriting" in, the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. SECTION 11. Defaulting Underwriters. If, on either Delivery Date, any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Stock that the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such Delivery Date in the respective proportions that the number of shares of the Firm Stock set opposite the name of each remaining non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto bears to the total number of shares of the Firm Stock set opposite the names of all the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters in Schedule 1 hereto; provided, however, that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any of the Stock on such Delivery Date if the total number of shares of the Stock that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date exceeds 9.09% of the total number of shares of the Stock to be purchased on such Delivery Date, and any remaining non-defaulting Underwriter shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the number of shares of the Stock that it agreed to purchase on such Delivery Date pursuant to the terms of Section 4. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, in such proportion as may be agreed upon among them, all the Stock to be purchased on such Delivery Date. If the remaining Underwriters or other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives do not elect to purchase the shares that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such Delivery Date, this Agreement (or, with respect to the Second Delivery Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase, and of the Selling Stockholders to sell, the Option Stock) shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Selling Stockholders, except that the Company and the Selling Stockholders will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses to the extent set forth in Sections 8 and 13. As used in this Agreement, the term "UNDERWRITER" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context requires otherwise, any party not listed in Schedule 1 hereto who, pursuant to this Section 11, purchases Stock that a defaulting Underwriter agreed to, but failed to, purchase. Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Selling Stockholders for damages caused by its default. If other underwriters are obligated or agree to purchase the Stock of a defaulting or withdrawing Underwriter, either the Representatives or the Company may postpone the 25
Delivery Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement. SECTION 12. Termination. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to and received by the Selling Stockholders prior to delivery of and payment for the Firm Stock if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 9(j), 9(k) or 9(l), shall have occurred or if the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Stock for any reason permitted under this Agreement. SECTION 13. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expense. If the Selling Stockholders shall fail to tender the Stock for delivery to the Underwriters by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Selling Stockholders to perform any agreement on its part to be performed, or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Selling Stockholders (including, without limitation, with respect to the transactions) is not fulfilled, the Selling Stockholders will reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Stock, and upon demand the Selling Stockholders shall pay the full amount thereof to the Representatives. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11 by reason of the default of one or more Underwriters, the Selling Stockholders shall not be obligated to reimburse any defaulting Underwriter on account of those expenses. SECTION 14. Notices, Etc. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and: (a) if to the Underwriters, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Lehman Brothers Inc., 745 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, Attention: Syndicate Department (Fax: 212-526-6588), with a copy, in the case of any notice pursuant to Section 10(d), to the Director of Litigation, Office of the General Counsel, Lehman Brothers Inc., 745 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10019; (b) if to the Company, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Chief Financial Officer (Fax: 314-342-7597); (c) if to a Selling Stockholder, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of such Selling Stockholder set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Chief Investment Officer (Fax: 212-526-2991). provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 10(d) shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its acceptance telex to the Representatives, which address will be supplied to any other party hereto by the Representatives upon request. Any such 26
statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect at the time of receipt thereof. The Company and the Selling Stockholders shall be entitled to act and rely upon any request, consent, notice or agreement given or made on behalf of the Underwriters by Lehman Brothers Inc. on behalf of the Representatives. SECTION 15. Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Underwriters, the Company, the Selling Stockholders, and their respective successors. This Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof are for the sole benefit of only those persons, except that (A) the representations, warranties, indemnities and agreements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall also be deemed to be for the benefit of the person or persons, if any, who control any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and (B) the indemnity agreement of the Underwriters contained in Section 10(c) of this Agreement shall be deemed to be for the benefit of directors of the Company, its officers and employees and any person controlling the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, other than the persons referred to in this Section 15, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. SECTION 16. Survival. The respective indemnities, representations, warranties and agreements of the Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf on them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Stock and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any of them or any person controlling any of them. SECTION 17. Definition of the Terms "BUSINESS DAY" and "SUBSIDIARY." For purposes of this Agreement, (a) "BUSINESS DAY" means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday that is not a day on which banking institutions in New York are generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close and (b) "SUBSIDIARY" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 of the Rules and Regulations. SECTION 18. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York. SECTION 19. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and, if executed in more than one counterpart, the executed counterparts shall each be deemed to be an original but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. SECTION 20. Headings. The headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of, or to affect the meaning or interpretation of, this Agreement. 27
