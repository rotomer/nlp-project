Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
Structure and Price of the Transactions
     On February 29, 2004, Peabody Energy Corporation ("the Company") signed two definitive agreements to purchase three coal operations from RAG Coal International AG. Closing on the transactions is expected within the next three months and requires no additional U.S. or Australian regulatory approvals. The combined purchase price is $441 million in cash, subject to certain price adjustments.
     Under the Australia purchase agreement, the Company will acquire, through one of its subsidiaries, all of the outstanding ordinary shares and redeemable preference shares of RAG Australia Coal Pty Limited ("RAG Australia"). In exchange for the shares, the Company agreed to pay $250 million, subject to adjustment for certain changes in shareholder's equity between December 31, 2003 and the closing.
     Under the Colorado purchase agreement, the Company will acquire, through one of its subsidiaries, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Twentymile Coal Company, Colorado Yampa Coal Company, RAG Empire Corporation and RAG Shoshone Coal Corporation (collectively, "RAG Colorado"). In exchange for the shares of capital stock, the Company agreed to pay $191 million, subject to adjustment for certain changes in stockholder's equity of the four companies and changes in liabilities and assets relating to employee benefits of former employees of RAG Shoshone Coal Corporation, between December 31, 2003 and the closing.
     The Company plans to finance the $441 million purchase price with the issuance of $200 million aggregate principal amount of new senior notes and the remainder from the sale of shares of Company common stock.
Transaction Closing and Closing Conditions
     Each party's obligation to consummate the transactions is subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions as specified in the purchase agreement for the transaction. The RAG Australia and RAG Colorado transactions will close the later of April 15, 2004 and five business days after the satisfaction or waiver of these conditions.
     In the case of RAG International (the seller), each acquisition is contingent upon the approval of the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of North Rhineland-Westphalia. Also, the RAG Colorado transaction is contingent upon the receipt of approval from the institutional lenders under RAG American Coal Company's credit facility. In addition to customary closing conditions, the closing of each of the RAG Australia transaction and the RAG Colorado transaction is contingent upon the simultaneous closing of the other transaction.
     In the case of the Company, each transaction is contingent upon the absence of a material adverse change in the business of the companies being acquired under the purchase agreement for such transaction since December 31,2003 and the receipt of third-party approvals identified by us in the purchase agreements. The Australia transaction is contingent upon RAG Australia Coal's underground mine at North Goonyella being in operation in all material respects at the closing and having produced at least 187,393 tons of run-of-mine coal during March 2004.
     We expect both closings to occur in the second quarter of 2004.

The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 is presented as if the acquisitions had occurred on that date.

     The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with (i) the historical audited financial statements of the Company and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, (ii) the historical audited financial statements of RAG Colorado included in this Form 8-K and (iii) the historical audited financial statements of RAG Australia included in this Form 8-K.

If notice is given to an indemnifying person of the assertion of any Tax Claim and the indemnifying person, if entitled to control the defense of such Tax Claim under this Section 5.3, does not, within thirty (30) Business Days after the indemnified person's notice is given, assume the defense of such Tax Claim, then the indemnified person may, unless and until such indemnifying person assumes control of such Tax Claim, in good faith, pay any Tax asserted against such indemnified person under such Tax Claim, in which case, such indemnifying person shall advance (together with any advance under Section 5.3(b)(v) hereto, an "Advance") the amount of such Tax payment (or if lesser, the portion of such amount indemnifiable by it in respect of such Tax Claim under Section 5.3 hereto) to the indemnified person on an interest free basis within 5 Business Days after a written demand for such amount and proof of payment of such amount is provided to the indemnifying person by such indemnified person; provided, however, that under no circumstances shall an Advance be repayable in an amount in excess of the amount of refund (including any interest thereon) received from the relevant Taxing Authority or 41
credited against or offset against any Tax liability of any indemnified person or any Affiliate thereof to which the Advance relates. (ii) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller Parent shall control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Taxing Authority with respect thereto and settle or comprise any such Tax Claim, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; provided, however, that (i) Seller Parent shall provide Buyer with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each stage of the proceedings related to such Tax Claim, and that (ii) Seller Parent shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Claim in a manner that would adversely affect Buyer and its Affiliates after the Closing Date without obtaining the prior written consent of Peabody and Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (iii) Peabody and Buyer shall have the right to retain separate counsel at their sole cost and expense and to reasonably participate in the aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim that have material relevance to the Tax liabilities of Buyer and its Affiliates for any Post-Closing Tax Period. (iii) Seller Parent and Seller, on the one hand, and Peabody and Buyer, on the other hand, shall jointly control and participate in all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of any Company for a Straddle Period.

Advance in the amount of such requested payment (or if lesser, the portion of such amount indemnifiable by it in respect of such Tax Claim under Section 5.3 hereto) to the indemnified person on an interest free basis; provided, however, that under no circumstances shall an Advance be repayable in an amount in excess of the amount of refund (including any interest thereon) received from the relevant Taxing Authority or credited against or offset against any Tax liability of any indemnified person or any Affiliate thereof to which the Advance relates. (vi) Peabody, Buyer, each Company, and each of their respective Affiliates on the one hand, and Seller Parent, Seller and their respective Affiliates on the other, shall (and Peabody and Buyer shall cause each Company to) reasonably cooperate in contesting any Tax Claim, which cooperation shall include the retention and, upon request, the provision to the requesting person of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

For all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, Seller Parent and Buyer, as applicable, shall cause each Company to join in the Common Parent's consolidated federal Income Tax Return. Seller Parent and Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for each Company with respect to all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with prior practice, except as required by a change in applicable law. Buyer shall have the right to review and comment on the portion of any such Tax Return (other than Income Tax Returns) relating to any of the Companies. (ii) For any Straddle Period of any Company, Buyer shall (and Peabody shall cause Buyer to) timely prepare and file in a manner consistent with the Companies' prior practice with the appropriate Taxing Authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns, provided, however, that Seller Parent and Seller shall pay to Buyer, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date on which such Tax payment is due to the relevant Taxing Authority, the portion of such Tax allocated to a Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to Section 5.3(a)(iii) and which would be owed by Seller Parent pursuant to Section 5.3(a) with respect to the taxable periods covered by such Tax Returns reduced by any amount recovered by Buyer or Peabody (or any Affiliate thereof) in respect of such Taxes and amounts from third parties who are not Affiliates of Buyer or Peabody, to the extent such Taxes are in excess of the amount, if any, reserved for such Taxes or reflected as an accrued Tax liability on the Final Closing 43
Balance Sheet (other than an accrued Tax liability with respect to deferred Income Taxes); provided, further, that no such Tax Return shall be filed without the prior written consent of Seller Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Peabody, Buyer, Seller Parent and Seller agree to cause each Company to file all Tax Returns for any Straddle Period, to the extent permissible under applicable law, on the basis that the relevant taxable period ended as of the Closing Date, unless the relevant Taxing Authority will not accept a Tax Return filed on that basis. (iii) Seller Parent and Seller shall file to the extent required under applicable law, and may file to the extent they determine, upon their sole discretion, advisable or beneficial, any amended, consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns for taxable years ending on or prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that Buyer shall have the right to review and comment on the portion of any such Tax Return (other than Income Tax Returns) relating to any of the Companies. For those jurisdictions in which separate Tax Returns are filed by any Company, any such amended Tax Returns shall be prepared by Seller Parent and Seller and furnished to such Company for signature at least 30 days prior to the due date (taking into account any applicable extension) for filing such Tax Returns and, without Buyer's written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), no such Tax Return shall be filed if such Tax Return would have an adverse effect on Peabody, Buyer, or any of the Companies for any Post-Closing Tax Period. (iv) At Seller Parent's request, Peabody and Buyer shall cause each of the Companies (or any successor thereof) to make or join with Seller (or any other member of the Affiliated Group) in making any election if the making of such election does not have an adverse effect on Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) for any Post-Closing Tax Period or the portion of Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date. (v) Any failure by a party seeking indemnification to meet the requirements of this Section 5.3(c) shall not affect any indemnity obligation of the indemnifying person in favor of such party seeking indemnification under this Section 5.3 except to the extent that the indemnifying person demonstrates that the amounts (or any portion thereof) for which the indemnified person is seeking indemnification under this Section 5.3 resulted by reason of the indemnified person's failure to meet the requirements of this Section 5.3. (d) Survival. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the representations and warranties provided in Section 3.13 , the covenants provided in Section 5.1(b)(ix) and all the obligations and claims under this Section 5.3 shall expire ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. (e) Cooperation. Seller Parent, Seller, Peabody and Buyer shall (and Peabody and Buyer shall cause each Company to) reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and other representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes, which cooperation shall include the retention and, upon request, the provision to the requesting person of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Taxes and Tax Returns, and making employees available on a 44
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Taxes and Tax Returns. (f) Refunds. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes received by any Company (or any of its respective Affiliates before or after the Closing, including Peabody and Buyer), or with respect to which the Company (or any of its respective Affiliates before or after the Closing, including Peabody and Buyer) realizes a benefit that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Company shall be for the account of Seller Parent except to the extent the amount of such refund, offset or credit has been accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet as an asset. To the extent a refund for a Pre-Closing Tax Period has been accrued as an asset on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, such refund shall be for the account of Buyer. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes received by any Company (or any of its respective Affiliates before or after the Closing, including Peabody and Buyer), or with respect to which the Company (or any of its respective Affiliates before or after the Closing, including Peabody and Buyer) realizes a benefit that relates to any Post-Closing Tax Period of any Company shall be for the account of Buyer. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes received by any Company (or any of its respective Affiliates before or after the Closing, including Peabody and Buyer), or with respect to which the Company (or any of its respective Affiliates before or after the Closing, including Peabody and Buyer) realizes a benefit that relates to any Straddle Period of any Company shall be equitably apportioned between Seller Parent and Buyer in a manner similar to the method described in Section 5.3(a)(iii); provided, that, with respect to refunds allocated to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period, such refunds shall not be for the account of the Seller Parent to the extent such refunds have been accrued as an asset on the Final Closing Balance Sheet. Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, to the extent any such refund, credit or offset of Taxes is (A) (i) allocated to Seller Parent, (ii) payable to a customer of any Company pursuant to an agreement between the customer and such Company entered into on or prior to Closing and (iii) in respect of an obligation for which no liability was accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet or (B)(i) allocated to Buyer, (ii) payable to a customer of any Company pursuant to an agreement between the customer and such Company entered into on or prior to Closing and (iii) in respect of an obligation for which a liability was accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, then such refund instead shall be paid to such customer. Each party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the party (or to the customer, as the case may be) entitled to receive the amount or economic benefit of a refund, credit or offset to Tax the amount of such refund, or the economic benefit of such credit or offset to Tax, within 30 days after such refund is received or after such credit or offset is allowed or applied against another Tax liability, as the case may be. Upon reasonable request by, and at the expense of, Seller Parent, Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all claims for refunds that are for the account of Seller Parent, to the extent that such claims for refund would not have an adverse effect on Buyer or any Affiliate thereof for any Tax period (or a portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, and the provisions of Sections 5.3(b)(ii) and (vi) shall apply, with the necessary modifications, with respect to any proceedings relating to such tax claims; provided, however, that Buyer shall have no such obligation to prepare and file a claim for refund that is for the account of Seller Parent unless, upon Buyer's request and Seller 45
Parent's expense, Seller Parent delivers to Buyer an opinion of counsel from a nationally recognized law firm that there is a reasonable basis for the position taken with respect to claim for refund. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in respect of each refund, credit, or offset of Taxes accrued as an asset on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, Buyer shall be entitled to receive from Seller Parent (within five (5) Business Days after Seller Parent's receipt of notice from Buyer regarding the occurrence of any of the following events) the amount by which such refund, credit, or offset of Taxes is, after the Closing Date, (i) reduced or denied by an applicable Taxing Authority (x) by a "final determination" (within the meaning of Section 5.3(l) hereto, with the necessary modifications) of such denial or reduction or (y) by Seller Parent's failure, within thirty (30) Business Days after the indemnified person's notice is given, to assume the defense of such Tax Claim, if notice is given to the Seller Parent of the assertion of any Tax Claim with respect to such refund, credit or offset and if Seller Parent is entitled to control the defense of such Tax Claim under Section 5.3, (ii) reduced by application of such refund to actually offset and reduce a liability for Taxes of any Company for the Pre-Closing Tax Period or for the portion of the Straddle Period beginning prior to the Closing Date and ending on the Closing Date, as allocated to Seller Parent in accordance with Section 5.3(a)(iii) hereto, to the extent that such liability for Taxes was not accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, or (iii) not realized by the Companies, Buyer or Peabody (or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing) due to a determination that it is payable to a customer of any Company pursuant to an agreement between the customer and such Company entered into on or prior to Closing or owed to a Person pursuant to a Tax sharing or reimbursement agreement between such Person and such Company entered into on or prior to Closing, to the extent that such liability to the customer or such Person was not accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, upon the payment of such amount to the customer or such Person. For purposes of this Section 5.3(f), a refund shall include any interest thereon. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent Seller Parent has reimbursed (pursuant to this paragraph) Buyer for a refund that has been accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet and Buyer, Peabody, or any Affiliate of the foregoing (including the Companies) subsequently receives such refund (or any portion thereof) from the relevant Taxing Authority, Buyer shall promptly pay over to Seller Parent such refund (or portion thereof) to the extent Seller Parent has reimbursed or indemnified Buyer under this Section 5.3(f). If Buyer receives a refund from a Taxing Authority and pays such amount to Seller Parent pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.3(f) and Seller was under an obligation to pay such refund over to a third party under a Tax sharing or reimbursement agreement, Seller Parent shall indemnify Buyer against any loss (reduced by the amount of any liability accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet in connection with such obligation) suffered as a result of a claim by such third party to be paid such refund under such Tax sharing or reimbursement agreement against Buyer. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in respect of any amount reserved for Taxes or accrued as a liability for Taxes (other than accruals for deferred Income Taxes) on the Final Closing Balance Sheet ("tax reserve"), Seller Parent shall be entitled to receive from Buyer or Peabody the amount by which any such tax reserve is in excess of the Tax liability (if any) for which such tax reserve was reserved or accrued, upon a "final determination" (within the meaning of Section 5.3(l) hereto, with the necessary modifications) of such Tax 46
liability or upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations relating to such Tax liability (or potential Tax liability), and Buyer or Peabody shall pay such excess amount to Seller Parent within five (5) Business Days after Buyer and Peabody's receipt of notice from Seller Parent regarding the occurrence of such "final determination" or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. (g) Tax Sharing Agreements. (i) Seller Parent and Seller shall cause the provisions of any agreement, arrangement or practice with respect to Taxes (including any Tax sharing agreements) between Seller Parent, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (other than any of the Companies), on the one hand, and any of the Companies, on the other hand, to be terminated on or before the Closing Date and to have no further effect. (ii) It is understood that the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement between Cyprus Amax Mineral Company, Amax Energy, Inc., Cyprus Amax Coal Company and Seller, dated June 30, 1999 (the "CA Tax Sharing Agreement") will not terminate upon the Closing, and after the Closing, upon Seller Parent's request, the Companies shall, and Buyer and Peabody shall cause the Companies (and any Affiliate thereof) to, cooperate with Seller Parent and Seller and take (or refrain from taking) any action (including the preparation or filing of a Tax Return) reasonably necessary to satisfy Seller's, Seller's Affiliates', Buyer's, Buyer's Affiliates', or any of the Companies' obligations and responsibilities (including the obligations and responsibilities of Cyprus Amax Coal Company assumed by Seller) with respect to or in connection with any Company under the CA Tax Sharing Agreement (including the transfer of Tax refunds to other persons under such agreement); provided however, that Buyer shall not be required to take (or refrain from taking) any action (or cause any of the Companies to take (or refrain from taking) any action) unless Buyer is reimbursed by Seller Parent for any expense Peabody, Buyer, the Companies or any of their respective Affiliates incurs by taking (or refraining from taking) such action. (h) Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and other such Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes, but excluding any Taxes based on or attributable to income or gains) and related fees (including any penalties, interest and additions to Tax) ("Transfer Taxes") arising out of or incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be borne equally by Peabody and Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller Parent and Seller, on the other hand. The party that is legally required to file a Tax Return relating to Transfer Taxes shall be responsible for preparing and timely filing such Tax Return. Buyer and Seller Parent shall have the right to review and comment on each such Tax Return and no such Tax Return will be filed without the prior written consents of both Buyer and Seller Parent (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). (i) Section 338(h)(10) Election. Seller and Buyer shall (and Seller Parent and Peabody, as applicable, shall cause Seller and Buyer to) join in timely making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable election under state, local or foreign Tax law) (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect to the sale of all of the Shares of the Companies, and Seller and Buyer shall (and Seller Parent and Peabody, as applicable, shall cause Seller and Buyer to) cooperate in the completion and timely filing of such elections in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (or any comparable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law) or any successor provision. For the purpose of making the Section 338(h)(10) Election, on or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer and the Seller each shall execute five copies of Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 (or successor 47
form) for each Section 338(h)(10) Election with respect to each Company. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller Parent for its review and consent, the allocation of the Purchase Price and the Liabilities of the Companies (plus other relevant items) among the Shares and the assets of the Companies in a manner consistent with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "Section 338 Allocation"). Seller Parent and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputed items within 30 days of receipt by Seller Parent. If Seller Parent and Buyer are unable to agree on the Section 338 Allocation within 30 days, Seller Parent and Buyer shall request the Neutral Auditor to decide the allocation of any disputed items. The cost of any such firm shall be borne equally by the Buyer and Seller Parent. Neither Seller nor Buyer (nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall take any position on any Tax Return with any Taxing Authority that is inconsistent with such allocation. (j) FIRPTA. Seller shall (and Seller Parent shall cause Seller to) deliver to Buyer at the Closing a duly executed and acknowledged certificate of non-foreign status described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2) (a "FIRPTA Certificate"). (k) Exclusivity. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any matter related to Taxes shall be governed solely by Sections 3.15, 5.1(b)(ix) and 5.3. (l) Timing of Payment. Any amount due and payable to any party pursuant to this Section 5.3, shall be paid within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written demand therefor from the person seeking indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.3 accompanied by a written statement describing in reasonable detail the basis for such indemnity and the computation of the amount so payable; provided, however, that if such indemnified amount relates to Taxes or any other amount payable by the indemnified person to a third party, such indemnified amount need not be paid by the indemnifying person prior to the date on which such Tax or other amount is actually paid to the appropriate Taxing Authority or other person and a proof of payment of such amount is provided to the indemnifying person. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (other than Section 5.3(b)(i) and Section 5.3(b)(v)) in this Agreement, any indemnification liability of the indemnifying person under this Section 5.3 with respect to Taxes shall become due and payable only upon a final determination of the liability of the indemnified person for such Taxes and any amounts owed to the indemnified person under this Section 5.3 with respect to Taxes shall be paid after such final determination as set forth above. A "final determination" shall be deemed to occur with respect to any liability for Taxes when (i) there is a decision, judgment, decree or other order by any court of competent jurisdiction, which decision, judgment, decree or other order has become final with respect to the indemnified person (i.e., all allowable appeals have been exhausted or the time period within which such appeals may be filed has expired), (ii) there is a closing agreement made under Section 7121 of the Code (or any analogous provision under the laws of any other jurisdiction) binding in respect of the indemnified person or other administrative settlement with the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental authority, (iii) the time for instituting a claim for refund in respect of the indemnified Taxes has expired, or, if a claim was filed, the time for instituting suit with respect thereto has expired, or (iv) the Taxes are paid, and, pursuant to a written agreement between the Seller Parent and the Buyer, no claim for refund is filed, and no other contest of such Taxes is made. Upon a final determination of a Tax Claim as 48
to which an Advance has been made by an indemnifying person, such Advance shall be offset against the full indemnified amount then due by such indemnifying person to the indemnified person pursuant to Section 5.3 hereto by reason of such Tax Claim, if any, and the remainder of such Advance, if any, shall be paid by the indemnified person to such indemnifying person within five (5) Business Days of such final determination, provided, however, that under no circumstances shall an Advance be repayable in an amount in excess of the amount of refund (including any interest thereon) received from the relevant Taxing Authority or credited against or offset against any Tax liability of any indemnified person or any Affiliate thereof to which the Advance relates. 5.4 Employees; Benefit Plans. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.4, during the period from the Closing Date through December 31, 2004 (the "Benefit Continuation Period"), Buyer, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, shall (and Peabody shall cause Buyer to), or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each Transferred Employee (as defined below) with employee benefits and other compensation arrangements that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits provided by Seller and its affiliates under the Company Plans to their similarly situated employees (excluding retiree welfare benefits); provided, however, that, during the Benefit Continuation Period, Buyer shall (and Peabody shall cause Buyer to) provide the Transferred Employees who become eligible or who are already eligible with retiree medical benefits that are no less favorable than those retiree medical benefits provided by Seller under the Company Plans immediately prior to the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, "Transferred Employee" shall mean an active employee (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any employee on leave due to long-term disability) of any of the Companies immediately prior to the Closing who becomes an employee of the Buyer as of the Closing. (b) Buyer shall (and Peabody shall cause Buyer to) give each Transferred Employee full credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Buyer in which the Transferred Employee participates on or after Closing for such years of service of the Transferred Employee with Seller or any Affiliate, to the same extent recognized by Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date, except to the extent such credit would result in an unintended duplication of benefits. (c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Buyer shall (and Peabody shall cause Buyer to), or shall cause its Affiliate to (A) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred Employees under any welfare benefit plans of the Buyer in which such Transferred Employees may be eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date, but only to the extent such condition, exclusion or period was satisfied or otherwise inapplicable to each such Transferred Employee under the applicable Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing and (B) provide each Transferred Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to and during the calendar year of the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare benefit plans of Buyer that any such Transferred Employee may be eligible to participate in on or after the Closing Date. (d) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall (and Peabody shall cause Buyer to) designate or establish a qualified defined benefit plan (the "Buyer Pension Plan") for 49
the benefit of the current and former employees of the Companies who participate in the Retirement Plan for Certain Hourly Employees of RAG American Coal Company and the Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees of RAG American Coal Company (the "Seller Pension Plans") (the "Participants"). The Buyer Pension Plan shall, with respect to the each Participant, at least until December 31, 2004, have terms and conditions that are substantially identical to the terms and conditions under the Seller Pension Plans, as applicable, as of the Closing Date. The Participants shall be listed on a statement referencing this Section 5.4(d), which Seller shall deliver to Buyer as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in no event later than the Closing Date). On or as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event more than 40 days after the Closing Date ("Transfer Date"), Seller shall (and Seller Parent shall cause Seller to) cause the trustee of the trust holding the assets of the Seller Pension Plans (the "Seller Pension Trust") to transfer assets in cash or, to the extent agreed by Buyer, marketable securities, equal to the Transfer Amount (as hereinafter defined) to the Peabody Holding Company, Inc. Master Trust (the "Buyer Pension Trust") in respect of the Buyer Pension Plan. In addition, prior to the Transfer Date, Seller and Buyer shall (and Seller Parent and Peabody, as applicable, shall cause Seller and Buyer to) provide each other with evidence reasonably satisfactory to the other that each of the Seller Pension Plans or the Buyer Pension Plan, as applicable, is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that the Seller Pension Trust or the Buyer Pension Trust, as applicable, is qualified under Section 501 of the Code. For purposes of this Section 5.4(d), the "Transfer Amount" shall be the assets allocable to the Participants as of the Closing Date, determined as provided in Section 414(l) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder, using the assumptions set forth in the report from Towers Perrin (the "Towers Perrin Report") to Mr. Frank J. Wood with the title "Allocation of Plan Liabilities on an ERISA 4044 Basis for Twentymile Sale", dated February 17, 2004, after application of the allocation rules of Section 4044 of ERISA (such Transfer Amount shall be as agreed upon by the Seller's actuary and the Buyer's actuary), plus (B) interest accruing from the Closing Date through the Transfer Date on the Transfer Amount using the rate paid on a 90-day Treasury Bill on the auction date coincident with or immediately preceding the Closing Date, minus (C) any payments made to or in respect of the Participants pursuant to the Seller Pension Plan. Subject to the transfer of the Transfer Amount to the Buyer Pension Trust on the Transfer Date, in consideration for the Transfer Amount, Buyer shall, effective as of the Transfer Date, assume all of the obligations of Seller in respect of benefits accrued by the Participants under the Seller Pension Plans (exclusive of amounts paid prior to the Transfer Date). Buyer shall not assume any other obligations or liabilities arising under or attributable to the Seller Pension Plans and Seller Pension Trust. For purposes of this paragraph, "evidence reasonably satisfactory" to a party of a plan's qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code and a corresponding trust's qualification under Section 501(a) of the Code shall include a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service as to such status, as the plan and trust are currently in effect (including any required changes thereto), or (if no such letter has been requested or received), an opinion of counsel, which states that such plan and trust in form comply with the applicable requirements of the Code and a commitment that the party will make any changes required by the Internal Revenue Service to receive a favorable determination letter. Buyer shall preserve for the Participants under the Buyer Pension Plan protected benefits, including the lump sum benefit option, to the extent required by Section 411(d)(6) of the Code with respect to benefits of the Participants accrued under the Seller Pension Plans on or prior to the Closing Date, which accrued benefits are transferred to the Buyer Pension Plan. Seller and Buyer, as applicable, shall timely file any forms required by the 50
Internal Revenue Service (e.g., Form 5310) or other governmental agency as a result of the foregoing transfer provisions. (e) As of or as soon as practicable following the Closing, Buyer shall (and Peabody shall cause Buyer to) establish or designate a defined contribution plan to which the Transferred Employees may roll over their full account balances under the Seller's qualified contribution plan, including outstanding plan loans thereunder, subject to the terms and conditions of the plan established or designated by Buyer. (f) As soon as practicable following the date hereof (but in no event later than the Closing), Seller shall (and Seller Parent shall cause Seller to) deliver to Buyer a statement referencing this Section 5.4(f) setting forth (i) a list of all of the Former Shoshone Employees and identifying which Former Shoshone Employees are entitled to receive benefits under the Seller Pension Plans, retiree healthcare benefits, black lung benefits, long-term disability benefits and workers compensation benefits and (ii) to the extent not included in clause (i), a list of all current and former employees of each Company who participate in any Seller Pension Plan as of the date of such statement (which date shall be a date prior to the Closing Date). (g) Peabody and Buyer shall bear their own expenses and the expenses of their respective Affiliates in connection with the administration of pension benefits, retiree healthcare benefits, black lung benefits, workers compensation benefits and long-term disability benefits of the Former Shoshone Employees. 5.5 Further Actions. (a) Peabody, Buyer, Seller Parent, and Seller shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, and cooperate with each other to do so, including, without limitation, obtaining as promptly as practicable all Consents necessary in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (b) Seller Parent, Seller, Peabody and Buyer shall (i) take all actions necessary to file as soon as practicable all notifications, filings and other documents required to obtain all governmental authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers, including, without limitation, under the Competition Laws, (ii) respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from any other Governmental Authority for additional information or documentation under the Competition Laws and (iii) respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries and requests received from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the transactions contemplated hereby (or any part thereof) in connection therewith. Seller Parent, Seller, Peabody and Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as maybe asserted with respect to the sale and purchase of the Shares contemplated hereby under any Competition Laws by any Governmental Authorities with regulatory jurisdiction over the enforcement of such Competition Laws; provided that in no event shall Peabody, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates have any obligation to dispose of, hold separate or otherwise restrict its enjoyment of any of their respective assets or properties (including any Company following the Closing). 51
(c) Seller Parent and Seller shall give prompt written notice to Peabody and Buyer of the occurrence of any Companies Material Adverse Effect. At all times prior to the Closing, (i) Seller Parent and Seller will promptly notify Peabody and Buyer in writing of any fact, condition, event or occurrence that will result in the failure of any of the conditions contained in ARTICLE VII to be satisfied, promptly upon any of them becoming aware of the same and (ii) Peabody and Buyer will promptly notify Seller Parent and Seller in writing of any fact, condition, event or occurrence that will result in the failure of any of the conditions contained in ARTICLE VI to be satisfied, promptly upon any of them becoming aware of the same. 5.6 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, Seller Parent, Seller, Peabody and Buyer will from time to time, execute and deliver such additional instruments, documents, conveyances or assurances and take such other actions as shall be necessary, or otherwise reasonably requested by Seller Parent and Seller, on the one hand, or Peabody and Buyer, on the other hand, as applicable, to confirm and assure the rights and obligations provided for in this Agreement and render effective the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. 5.7 Closing Balance Sheet. The Closing Balance Sheet to be delivered by Seller shall reflect, reserve or disclose all Liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries required by GAAP to be so reflected, reserved or disclosed. 5.8 Nonsolicitation. (a) Seller Parent and Seller agree that for a period of one (1) year after the Closing Date, they will not, and they will cause each of their Affiliates not to, (a) entice, induce or attempt to cause (other than pursuant to general advertising not directed to such employees), any executive, officer or other key employee of any Company to terminate his or her employment with any Company or (b) employ any such executive officer or other key employee; provided, however, that the foregoing restrictions shall not be applicable with respect to any Person whose employment with Peabody or Buyer or their subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, any Company) has been terminated by Peabody or Buyer or their subsidiaries (including after the Closing, any Company) prior to such solicitation or employment. (b) Except as may otherwise be agreed to by the parties, Peabody and Buyer agree that for a period of one (1) year after the Closing Date, they will not, and they will cause each of their Affiliates not to, (a) entice, induce or attempt to cause (other than pursuant to general advertising not directed to such employees), any executive, officer or other key employee of RAG American Coal Holding, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries (other than the Companies) or (b) employ any such executive officer or other key employee; provided, however, that the foregoing restrictions shall not be applicable with respect to any such Person whose employment with RAG Coal Holding, Inc. or its subsidiaries has been terminated by RAG American Coal Holding, Inc. or its subsidiaries prior to such solicitation or employment. (c) Each of Seller Parent and Seller, on the one hand, and Peabody and Buyer, on the other hand, hereby agrees that any remedy at law for any breach by it or its Affiliates of this Section 5.8 would be inadequate, that the non-breaching party or parties shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief in such case in addition to any other right such non-breaching party or parties may have, whether at law or in equity. If it is ever held that any part of any of 52
the covenants of this Section 5.8 is too broad to permit enforcement of such covenants to their fullest extent, each of Seller Parent and Seller, on the one hand, and Peabody and Buyer, on the other hand, hereby agrees that a court of competent jurisdiction is hereby authorized and directed to enforce such covenants to the maximum extent permitted by law, and each such party hereby consents and agrees that such scope may be judicially modified accordingly in any proceeding brought to enforce such covenants. Seller Parent, Seller, Peabody and Buyer each acknowledge that in relation to this Agreement and in particular this clause it has received legal advice or has had the opportunity of obtaining legal advice. 5.9 Competing Transaction; Return of Confidential Information. (a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, none of Seller Parent, Seller or any of their Affiliates or their respective representatives shall, directly or indirectly (i) solicit or encourage the submission of any inquiries, indications of interest, proposals or offers from any Person other than Peabody and Buyer (collectively, "Third Parties"), concerning the sale of any equity securities or all or any substantial part of the assets of any Company to, or any merger or other business combination transaction involving any Company with, any such Third Party (a "Competing Transaction") or (ii) participate with any Third Party in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or enter into any agreements with any Third Party relating to, a Competing Transaction with such Third Party, or provide any information concerning any Company to any Third Party with respect to a Competing Transaction with such Third Party, including any Third Parties that Seller Parent, Seller, or any of their Affiliates or representatives had conducted negotiations with prior to the date of this Agreement. Seller Parent and Seller will promptly notify Peabody and Buyer, after the receipt by Seller Parent or Seller or any of their Affiliates, from a third party other than Peabody and Buyer, of any bona fide written proposal for a Competing Transaction, of the principal terms of such proposal, excluding the identity of any party thereto, any party on whose behalf such proposal is delivered or the identity of any of their respective representatives. (b) Seller Parent and Seller shall instruct each Third Party to whom either delivered confidential information in connection with a Competing Transaction or other possible sale of any Company to (i) return to Seller or destroy such information (and copies thereof) and (ii) certify in writing any such destruction, in each case, to the extent such Third Parties shall be required to do so pursuant to applicable confidentiality agreements. 5.10 Confidentiality. (a) Seller and Seller Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, consultants, advisors, agents, employees and representatives (together, the "Seller Representatives") to, keep confidential and not disclose to any Person, any Confidential Information with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than disclosure to Seller Representatives responsible for matters relating to this Agreement); provided that, subject to the requirements of all applicable Laws, Seller, Seller Parent and the Seller Representatives may disclose any such information to the extent that: (i) such information is or becomes generally available to the public through no act or omission of such Person; (ii) such information otherwise is or becomes known to such Person other than by disclosure by another Person to such agreement or an Affiliate thereof, provided that the source of such information is not known by such Person to be bound by a confidentiality agreement or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality; or (iii) such Person is required by law or legal process to disclose such information. "Confidential Information" means all technical, financial and other 53

In addition, Seller Parent and Seller shall agree to use their reasonable best efforts to enforce all confidentiality agreements, if any, entered into by Seller Parent or Seller, on the one hand, and any Seller Representative, on the other, in each case to the extent such provisions pertain to the business or assets of any Company. (b) Buyer and Peabody shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, consultants, advisors, agents, employees and representatives (together the "Buyer Representatives") to, keep confidential and shall not disclose to any Person, any Seller Confidential Information with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than disclosure to Buyer Representatives responsible for matters relating to this Agreement); provided that subject to the requirements of all applicable laws, Buyer, Peabody and the Buyer Representatives may disclose any such information to the extent that (i) such information is or becomes generally available to the public through no act or omission of such Person; (ii) such information otherwise is or becomes known to such Person other than by disclosure by another Person to such agreement or an Affiliate thereof, provided that the source of such information is not known by such Person to be bound by a confidentiality agreement or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality; or (iii) such Person is required by law or legal process to disclose such information. "Seller Confidential Information" means all technical, financial and other information (including but not limited to information relating to customers of Seller Parent and Seller (other than customers of the Companies) and information of any regulatory nature) whatsoever, in whatever form it may be held, relating to the business and operations of Seller Parent or Seller (other than any such information relating to the Companies), or so furnished under this Agreement and made available to Peabody, Buyer and the Buyer Representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (other than any such information relating to the Companies).

5.15 Seller Guarantees; Seller Bonds. (a) Seller Guarantees. Following the date of this Agreement and prior to Closing, Buyer, Peabody, Seller and Seller's Affiliates shall (i) cooperate with one another in order to, and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts in order to, replace all of the Seller Guarantees with guarantees given by Peabody or its Affiliates (which commercially reasonable efforts shall include preparing and submitting documents and providing information and responses to requests from the beneficiaries of such Seller Guarantees) and (ii) use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause Seller and all Affiliates of Seller who are parties to the Seller Guarantees to be fully released and discharged with respect thereto, in each case, as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Buyer nor Peabody will contact any party to any Seller Guaranty (other than the Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries, and other Affiliates of the Seller) prior to the Closing without the prior consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. With respect to any Seller Guarantees that are not fully released and discharged as of the Closing Date, Buyer and Peabody shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to replace such Seller Guarantees and/or to cause Seller and all Affiliates of Seller to be fully released and discharged therefrom. Following the date of this Agreement and prior to Closing, Seller shall not enter into any Seller Guarantees without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Any such Seller Guarantees with respect to which Buyer consents shall be deemed to be included on Schedule 1.1(F) for all purposes of this Agreement. (b) Seller Bonds. At or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the replacement of each Seller Bond by posting a new bond in form and substance satisfactory to the applicable beneficiary of such Seller Bond or, if such beneficiary is a federal government agency of the United States, in accordance with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 9304-9308. At the Closing, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller such other documents as may reasonably be requested by Seller in order to permit Seller to effect the full release and discharge of Seller and all Affiliates of Seller of the Seller Bonds as provided in this Section 5.15(b). Following the date of this Agreement and prior to Closing, Seller shall not enter into any Seller Bonds without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Any such Seller Bonds with respect to which Buyer consents shall be deemed to be included on Schedule 1.1(E) for all purposes of this Agreement. (c) Indemnification After Closing. Until all of the Seller Guarantees and Seller Bonds are fully released and discharged, Buyer and Peabody shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold Seller and all Affiliates of Seller harmless from and against, and pay and reimburse Seller and all Affiliates of Seller for, any and all out-of-pocket: (i) Losses that Seller or any of its Affiliates suffer as a result of being required to make any payment under the Seller Guarantees or Seller Bonds after the Closing Date as a result of either (x) the failure of any Company to meet its obligations underlying the Seller Guarantees or Seller Bonds or (y) the failure of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) to be fully released from the Seller Guarantees or Seller Bonds, and (ii) reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including, without limitation, premium payments, bank fees or similar costs) after the Closing Date relating to extension or renewal of Seller Bonds or Seller Guarantees that have not been fully released and discharged. The indemnification 57
obligation of Buyer and Peabody pursuant to this Section 5.15(c) shall not be subject to any limitation under Section 9.1 of this Agreement. (d) Required Efforts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any party hereto be required to file any lawsuit or to take other legal action, make any amendment to any Seller Guarantee or waive any rights thereunder or pay any amount, in order to cause the replacement and/or release and discharge of any Seller Guarantee (provided, however, nothing in this sentence shall prohibit any party from taking such actions). After the Closing, Buyer will not, and will not permit any Company to, renew, extend, amend or supplement any loan, contract, lease or other obligation underlying any Seller Bond with respect to which Seller and its Affiliates are not fully released and discharged as of the Closing Date in any manner that would materially extend or materially increase the Liability of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller under such Seller Bond without providing Seller with evidence satisfactory to Seller that Seller and its Affiliates have been fully released and discharged from such Seller Bond. 5.16 Cooperation in Financing. (a) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause the Companies to, reasonably cooperate, and request the auditors of the Companies to, reasonably cooperate, with Peabody's and Buyer's auditors in connection with the financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The cooperation requested of the auditors of the Companies shall include providing consent to Peabody and Buyer to prepare and use Seller's audit reports relating to the Companies and to provide any necessary "comfort letters". (b) Without limitation of Section 5.16(a), prior to the Closing, the Seller shall, and shall cause the Companies to, provide, and request their respective accountants, advisors, counsel and other representatives to provide, reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of financing by Peabody and Buyer in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such cooperation shall include, to the extent reasonable and customary, arranging for officers of the Companies to meet with prospective lenders and investors in presentations, meetings, road shows and due diligence sessions, reasonable assistance with preparation of registration statements, offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents and the execution and delivery of any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates, legal opinions or documents as may be reasonably be requested by Buyer. 5.17 Mexico Agency Agreement. (a) Buyer acknowledges its understanding that the sale to Mexican customers of coal produced at the Twentymile mine is subject to the payment of a commission to Coraza International S.A. de C.V. ("Coraza") pursuant to the terms of an Agency Agreement between RAG energy sales, Inc. ("RAG Energy"), as successor in interest to Cyprus Amax Coal Sales Corporation, and Coraza dated November 1, 1994, as most recently amended by a Third Amendment dated March 24, 1999 (such agreement, as so amended, the "Mexico Agency Agreement"). Seller and Seller Parent, on the one hand, and Buyer and Peabody, on the other hand, will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other and with Coraza, with a view toward either (a) the assignment to Twentymile Company, with the consent of Coraza, of the rights and obligations of RAG Energy under the Mexico Agency Agreement to the extent (and only to the extent) the same relate to coal produced from the Twentymile mine, or (b) the execution by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer of a new agency agreement with Coraza substantially similar to the Mexico Agency Agreement but 58
relating only to coal produced from the Twentymile mine. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer will indemnify Seller, Seller Parent and their respective Affiliates from and against any and all liability to Coraza incurred after the Closing Date under the Mexico Agency Agreement in respect of coal produced from the Twentymile mine and sold to Mexican customers.

Claims made pursuant to the representations and warranties contained in or made pursuant to Section 3.13 (Taxes) will not be subject to the limitations for this Section 9.1(c). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (v) Seller shall have no liability or obligation to Peabody or Buyer for any Loss to the extent the liability attributable to such Loss is reflected or reserved against (other than reserved for deferred Taxes) (but only to the extent so reflected or reserved) in the Final Closing Balance Sheet, and the amount of any such Loss, to the extent so reflected or reserved, shall not count toward any threshold referred to above; (x) any amount payable by an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Loss shall be reduced by any related insurance recovery received by the Indemnified Party (net of any costs incurred in order to obtain such recovery and the effect of any retrospective rate increase) and by any payments received by such Indemnified Party from third parties who are not Affiliates of such Indemnified Party; (y) the calculation of the amount of any Losses arising out of the breach of more than one representation or warranty shall be determined without duplication or double-counting of the same Loss; and (z) upon payment of any amount pursuant to a claim for indemnification hereunder, the Indemnifying Party (as defined in Section 9.1(d)) shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnified Party (as defined in Section 9.1(d)) against any third party with respect to the matters to which such claim relates. (d) Notice and Opportunity to Defend. (i) If there occurs an event which a party (an "Indemnified Party") asserts is an indemnifiable event pursuant to Section 9.1(a) or 9.1(b), respectively, the Indemnified Party shall provide the other party obligated to provide indemnification (an "Indemnifying Party") promptly with written notice thereof, which notice 64
shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification. If such event involves (i) any claim or (ii) the commencement of any action or proceeding by a third Person (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party will give such Indemnifying Party prompt written notice of such claim or the commencement of such action or proceeding, which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for such claim or action to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party, but the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such indemnifiable event is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to give such notice. (ii) If any Third-Party Claim is against an Indemnified Party and it gives notice to the Indemnifying Party of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the Indemnifying Party is also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of its financial capacity to defend such Third-Party Claim and provide indemnification with respect to such Third-Party Claim), to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Article IX for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) such assumption will conclusively establish for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Third-Party Claim are within the scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Party's Consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims effected without its Consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party does not, within ten days after the Indemnified Party's notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be bound by any determination made in such Third-Party Claim or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Party. (iii) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing in this Section 9.1(d), if an Indemnified Party determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the 65
exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any determination of any Third-Party Claim so defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any compromise or settlement effected without its Consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld). (iv) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this Article IX: (i) both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, shall keep the other Person fully informed of the status of such Third-Party Claims and any related Proceedings at all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel, and (ii) the parties agree (each at its own expense) to render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim. (e) Other Damages. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no Indemnifying Party shall be liable to an Indemnified Party for any consequential or punitive damages. For purposes of this paragraph, consequential and punitive damages do not include out-of-pocket Losses incurred by an Indemnified Party and resulting from a Third Party Claim. 9.2 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by Buyer and Seller as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS 10.1 Fees and Expenses.

Seller shall cause each of the Company and its Subsidiaries to afford Peabody's and Buyer's officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other authorized representatives, including representatives of any Persons providing financing to Peabody or Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, access during normal business hours throughout the period from the date hereof to the Closing or the date of termination of this Agreement, (A) to it and its properties, contracts, commitments, books and records (including but not limited to Tax Returns) and to 44
cause its representatives to furnish promptly to Buyer such additional financial and operating data and other existing information as to its business and properties as Buyer or its duly authorized representatives may from time to time reasonably request and (B) to meet with any party to a Joint Venture Agreement on reasonable notice and to the extent that it is within the control of Seller. Between the date hereof and the Closing, Peabody and Buyer shall be permitted to maintain, at Peabody's expense, a representative on site at the North Goonyella mine site, which Person shall be permitted access to the properties and offices at such mine site, including, without limitation, for purposes of monitoring the performance of Longwall 4-North and the geological and operational conditions at such mine site. Between the date hereof and the Closing, Peabody and Buyer shall be permitted to arrange for an independent geologist mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller to review, at Peabody's expense, the geological conditions at the North Goonyella mine site and to assess the expected geological conditions over the next twelve (12) months at the North Goonyella mine site. Between the date hereof and the Closing, Seller shall provide to the Buyer daily production reports for the North Goonyella mine (by email or fax) with commentary on any unusual material items that may have occurred or affected production during the relevant day. In the event that Seller determines that disclosure of any such information would be in violation of applicable Laws or the provisions of any confidentiality agreement to which either Seller or the Company is a party, Seller, Peabody and Buyer will use their best efforts to institute appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements that do not violate any such Laws or confidentiality obligations, to the extent reasonable under the circumstances. Unless otherwise required by Law and until the Closing Date, Peabody and Buyer will hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. 5.3 Tax Matters. (a) Cooperation. Peabody, Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance (including, at the expense of the requesting party, reasonable access to the other party's Tax Return preparer, provided that such other party may limit such access as is it deems necessary to protect confidential or privileged information) relating to the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (including access to books and records, employees, contractors and representatives) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election related to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax Return or Assessment. Seller agrees that it shall (i) consult with Peabody and Buyer prior to taking any position or settling any claim with respect to Taxes and obtain the prior written consent of Peabody or Buyer and (ii) not take any action with respect to Taxes that would legally bind Peabody, Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Peabody or Buyer if such position, settlement or action could have a material adverse effect to Peabody, Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. If Peabody or Buyer do not provide the relevant consent under this Section 5.3(a), no claim under this Agreement can be made by Peabody or Buyer against Seller in respect of any Taxes or Losses arising directly in respect of Seller failing to take the proposed position or settlement of claim with respect to such Taxes unless consenting to such action or settlement of the claim could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Peabody, Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of a period ending after Closing. Peabody, Buyer and Seller shall retain all books and records with respect to Taxes which are indemnifiable under this Section 5.3 and pertain to the Company until the expiration of the relevant Tax Amendment Periods (and, to the extent notified by Peabody, 45
Buyer and Seller, any extensions thereof). At the end of such period, each party shall provide the other with at least ten (10) Business Days' prior written notice before destroying any such books and records, during which period the party receiving such notice can elect to take possession, at its own expense, of such books and records. (b) Preparation of Pre-Closing Tax Returns. (i) Except as set forth in Section 5.3(b)(ii), Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period and Seller, in respect of a Tax payment due prior to Closing Date, shall procure that the relevant company or companies pay all Taxes due on such Tax Returns or any applicable Assessment. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the last previous similar Tax Return and in accordance with Tax Law. (ii) In respect of a Tax Return due after the Closing Date for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a "Post-Closing Filing Return"), Seller shall provide Buyer with a copy of each Post-Closing Filing Return for Buyer's review and filing at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the filing of the relevant Post-Closing Filing Return and all such Post-Closing Filing Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the last previous similar Tax Return and in accordance with Tax Law. (c) GST Tax Returns. In respect of a Tax Return that is a return relating to GST, Section 5.3(b) shall apply as if any references to "thirty (30) days" shall be read as if the references were to "ten (10) days". (d) Duties. The Buyer shall (and Peabody shall cause Buyer to) pay all Duty arising in connection with this Agreement and any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, other than Duty arising in connection with the Company Restructuring. The Seller shall pay all Duty and prepare all filings arising in connection with the Company Restructuring. (e) Straddle Period Taxes. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), for the purposes of determining the liability of Seller under Section 5.3(f) for Taxes of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries in respect of the portion of the Straddle Period beginning prior to the Closing Date and ending on the Closing Date (the "Straddle Indemnification Period"), the Taxes of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (other than Duties imposed in connection with the sale of the Shares or otherwise in connection with this Agreement with the exception of any Duties arising in connection with or as a consequence of the Company Restructuring) shall be computed as if the period ended as of the Closing Date and, for this purpose, the Taxes referable to such a period will include any Tax referable to that period pursuant to a Tax Law that arises in respect of or by virtue of an act, transaction or event that occurred on or prior to Closing even though the Tax may not become due or payable until after Closing. For any Straddle Period of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall (and Peabody shall cause Buyer to) timely prepare and file with the appropriate Taxing Authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed and shall pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns; provided, that no such Tax Return shall be filed without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Buyer and Seller agree to cause each Company to file all Tax Returns for any Straddle Period, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, on the basis that the relevant taxable period ended as of the 46
Closing Date, unless the relevant Taxing Authority will not accept a Tax Return filed on that basis. If Peabody, Buyer and Seller cannot agree on a position taken in respect of a Straddle Period Tax Return within 30 days of the Buyer providing a copy of the relevant Tax Return to the Seller, or within such further time as may be agreed between them, then Buyer may refer the matter to an Expert to request that the Expert make a decision on the disagreement as soon as practicable after receiving any submission from the Buyer and Seller. The decision of Expert is to be conclusive and binding on the parties in the absence of manifest error. The Expert is appointed as an expert and not arbitrator. The procedures for determination are to be decided by the Expert in its absolute discretion. Unless the Expert makes a determination regarding costs, the Buyer and Seller each agree to pay one half of the Expert's costs and expenses in connection with the reference. (f) Tax Indemnity. (A) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement and any disclosures made in the Schedules, Seller shall indemnify Peabody and Buyer and their respective Affiliates (including the Company and each of its Subsidiaries) and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and other representatives and hold them harmless from (i) all liability for Taxes of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and Taxes referable to the Straddle Indemnification Period, as allocated to Seller in accordance with Section 5.3(e), (ii) all liability for Taxes of Seller or any other Person (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) which is or has ever been affiliated with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for which the Company or any Subsidiary becomes liable for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and Taxes referable to the Straddle Indemnification Period, as allocated to Seller in accordance with Section 5.3(e), (iii) all liability for Taxes of any Person (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and Taxes referable to the Straddle Indemnification Period, as allocated to Seller in accordance with Section 5.3(e), (iv) any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense attributable to any breach of any warranty or representation contained in Section 3.15 (relating to Taxes), without regard to any materiality qualifiers, or any breach by Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (other than, after the Closing, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) of any covenant contained in Section 5.1(b)(ix) of this Agreement (relating to Taxes), (v) subject to section 5.3(d) all liability for Taxes arising (directly or indirectly) as a result of the sale of the Shares or the other transactions contemplated herein (including the Company Restructuring), (vi) all liability for reasonable legal, accounting, appraisal, consulting or similar fees and expenses attributable to any item in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above (each a "Tax Loss"); provided, however, that in the case of clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) above, Seller shall be liable only to the extent that such Taxes (and other related amounts), are in excess of the amount, if any, reserved for such Taxes or reflected as an accrued Tax liability on the Final Closing Balance Sheet (other than an accrued Tax liability with respect to deferred taxes); provided, further, that if, in the Tax year the Tax Loss occurred (or within the two subsequent Tax years), a Tax Benefit (as defined in Section 9.1(c)) is actually realized by Buyer or Peabody or any Affiliate thereof as a result of such Tax Loss, then after the Indemnified Party files a Tax Return claiming such Tax Loss and realizes that Tax Benefit, Buyer will pay to Seller the Tax Benefit; provided, however, that such payment will not be made prior to the payment in full for such Tax Loss by Seller; provided, further, that to the extent that such Tax 47
Benefit is denied by a Taxing Authority, Seller shall pay over to Buyer the amount of such Tax Benefit previously made to Seller under this Section 5.3(f). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this indemnity shall not extend to any Tax or other amount to the extent that it arises as a direct result of one or more of the following: (i) any representation or warranty by any of Buyer or Peabody under this Agreement being incorrect in any material respect, (ii) the failure by any of Peabody or Buyer (or any Affiliate thereof) to perform or observe in any material respect its obligations under, or any covenant or condition in, this Agreement, or (iii) the willful gross misconduct or the gross negligence of any of Peabody, Buyer or any Affiliate thereof. (B) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Peabody and Buyer, jointly and severally, shall, and after the Closing shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and other representatives and hold them harmless from all liability for Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any tax period ending after the Closing Date (except that in the case of a Straddle Period, Peabody's and Buyer's indemnity will cover only such Taxes that are allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date pursuant to Section 5.3(e) above) and all liability for reasonable legal, accounting, appraisal, consulting or similar fees and expenses) attributable to such Taxes. (g) Refunds. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective Affiliates before or after the Closing, including Peabody and Buyer), or with respect to which the Company (or any of their respective Affiliates before or after the Closing, including Peabody and Buyer) realizes a benefit that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be for the account of Seller to the extent the amount of such refund, offset or credit has not been accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet; provided, however, that to the extent any such refund is payable to a customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and such refund is not booked as a liability on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, then such refund instead shall be paid to such customer. To the extent a refund that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period has been accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, such refund shall be for the account of Buyer. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective Affiliates before or after the Closing, including Peabody and Buyer), or with respect to which the Company (or any of their respective Affiliates before or after the Closing, including Peabody and Buyer) realizes a benefit that relates to any Post-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be for the account of Buyer. The amount or economic benefit of any refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective Affiliates before or after the Closing, including Peabody and Buyer), or with respect to which the Company (or any of their respective Affiliates before or after the Closing, including Peabody and Buyer) realizes a benefit that relates to any Straddle Period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be equitably apportioned between Seller and Buyer in a manner similar to the method described in Section 5.3(e); provided, that, with respect to refunds allocated to a Pre-Closing Period, such refunds shall be for the account of the Seller only to the extent such refunds have not been accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet; provided, however, that to the extent any such refund is (i) allocated to Seller, (ii) payable to a customer of the Company or any of its 48
Subsidiaries and (iii) is not booked as a liability on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, then such refund instead shall be paid to such customer. Each party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to the party (or to the customer, as the case may be) entitled to receive the amount or economic benefit of a refund, credit or offset to Tax the amount of such refund, or the economic benefit of such credit or offset to Tax, within 30 days after such refund is received or after such credit or offset is allowed or applied against another Tax liability, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in respect of each refund, credit, or offset of Taxes accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, Buyer shall be entitled to receive from Seller (promptly upon notice to Seller by Buyers) the amount by which such refund, credit, or offset of Taxes is, after the Closing Date, (i) reduced or denied by an applicable Taxing Authority (x) by way of an Assessment or (y) by Seller's failure, within thirty (30) Business Days after the indemnified person's notice is given, to assume the defense of such Tax Claim, if notice is given to the Seller of the assertion of any Tax Claim with respect to such refund, credit or offset and if Seller is entitled to control the defense of such Tax Claim under Section 5.3(h)(ii), (ii) reduced by application of such refund to actually offset and reduce a liability for Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period or for the portion of the Straddle Period beginning prior to the Closing Date and ending on the Closing Date, as allocated to Seller in accordance with Section 5.3(e) hereto, to the extent that such liability for Taxes was not accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, or (iii) not realized by the Company, and of its Subsidiaries, Buyer or Peabody (or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing) due to the amount being payable to a customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or owed to a Person pursuant to a Tax sharing or reimbursement agreement between such Person and such Company entered into on or prior to Closing, to the extent that such liability to the customer or such Person was not accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet, upon the payment of such amount to the customer or such Person. For purposes of this Section 5.3(g), a refund shall include any interest thereon. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent Seller has reimbursed (pursuant to the second preceding sentence) Buyer for a refund that has been accrued on the Final Closing Balance Sheet and Buyer subsequently receives such refund (or any portion thereof) from the relevant Taxing Authority, Buyer shall pay over to Seller such refund (or portion thereof) to the extent Seller has reimbursed or indemnified Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.3(g). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in respect of any amount reserved for Taxes or accrued as a liability for Taxes (other than any accruals for deferred income Taxes) on the Final Closing Balance Sheet ("tax reserve"), Seller shall be entitled to receive from Buyer or Peabody the amount by which any such tax reserve is in excess of the Tax liability (if any) for which such tax reserve was recognized or accrued, upon lodgement of the applicable Tax Return and payment of the related Tax liability. Buyer or Peabody shall pay such excess amount to Seller upon obtaining notice from Seller claiming an entitlement to such an amount but in no case will such a payment of the excess be required to be made within 30 days after the date of lodgement of the applicable Tax Return and payment of the related Tax. (h) Tax Claims. (i) If a claim shall be made by any Taxing Authority, which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment to an indemnified party, one of its Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents or representatives pursuant to Section 5.3 (a "Tax Claim"), then such indemnified party shall promptly give 49
notice to the indemnifying party in writing of such claim and of any counterclaim the indemnified party proposes to assert, provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party has been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. (ii) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Taxing Authority with respect thereto and settle or compromise any such Tax Claim, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; provided, however, that Seller shall provide Buyer with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each stage of the proceedings related to such Tax Claim, and provided further that Seller shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Claim in a manner that would adversely affect Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing Date without obtaining the prior written consent of Peabody and Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and Peabody and Buyer, and counsel of their choosing, shall have the right to participate fully in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim. (iii) Seller, on the one hand, and Peabody and Buyer, on the other hand, shall jointly control and participate in all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period. None of Seller, Peabody or Buyer shall settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. (iv) Peabody and Buyer shall control all proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Tax Period ending after the Closing Date, and shall (a) defend against such Tax Claim diligently and in good faith, (b) provide the Seller with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each stage of the proceedings related to such Tax Claim, (c) provide Seller with the right to reasonably participate in the defense of such Tax Claim at its expense, and (d) not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Claim that would adversely affect Seller or any of its Affiliates without obtaining the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. (v) Peabody, Buyer, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, and each of their respective Affiliates on the one hand, and Seller and its respective Affiliates on the other hand, shall (and Peabody and Buyer shall cause each Company to) reasonably cooperate in contesting any Tax Claim, which cooperation shall include the retention and, upon request, the provision to the requesting person of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim. 50
(i) Exclusivity. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any matter relating to Taxes shall be governed solely by Sections 3.15, 5.1(b)(ix) and 5.3. (j) Timing of Payment. Any payment by Seller pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall be made not later than 30 days after receipt by Seller of written notice from Buyer stating that any Tax has been paid by Buyer, or effective upon the Closing, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the amount of Tax thereof and of the amount of indemnity payment requested. (k) Survival. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the representations and warranties provided in Section 3.15, the covenants provided in Section 5.1(b)(ix) and all claims under this Section 5.3 shall not expire until ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable Tax Amendment Period. 5.4 Employees; Benefit Plans.

The several representations, warranties, covenants, undertakings and agreements of the parties contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant hereto, and the rights of the parties to seek indemnification with respect thereto, shall survive the Closing; provided, however, that, except in respect of any claims for indemnification as to which written notice shall have been duly given to the Indemnifying Party (as hereinafter defined) pursuant to Section 9.1(d) hereof prior to the relevant expiration date set forth below, and subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 9.1(c), such representations, warranties, covenants, undertakings and agreements, and the rights of the parties to seek indemnification with respect thereto, shall expire on the following dates (each an "Indemnity Termination Date"): (i) in the case of claims arising out of any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.4, such representations and warranties shall not expire; (ii) in the case of claims arising out of the breach of any covenants required to be performed after the Closing Date, on the thirtieth (30th) day after the obligations under such covenant shall cease to exist; and (iii) in the case of all other claims for indemnification arising under this Agreement or under any instrument delivered pursuant hereto, on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date. Any claim for indemnification under this Agreement which is made in good faith and in writing prior to the expiration of such claim on the Indemnity Termination Date shall survive such expiration until mutually resolved or otherwise determined hereunder, as applicable, and the Indemnity Termination Date for all purposes hereunder shall automatically be extended with respect to such claim (but not any other claims) until such claim is so mutually resolved or otherwise determined hereunder. Any such claim not so made in writing prior to the expiration of such claim on the relevant Indemnity Termination Date shall be deemed to have been waived. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.1, no party hereunder shall be entitled to recover under this ARTICLE IX with respect to claims for any inaccuracy or breach of any representations or warranties under Sections 9.1(a)(i) or (b)(i) (but excluding claims for any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.4 and 3.15) or any breach of the covenants set forth in Section 5.8 unless and until the total of all claims brought by such party for indemnity or damages with respect to any inaccuracy or breach of any such representations or warranties under Sections 9.1(a)(i) or (b)(i) (but excluding claims for any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.4 and 3.15) and any breach of the covenants set forth in Section 5.8, exceeds Six Million U.S. Dollars (US$6,000,000) and then only for the amount by which such claims for indemnity or damages exceed Six Million U.S. Dollars (US$6,000,000); provided, however, that no party hereunder 63
shall be entitled to recover under this ARTICLE IX with respect to claims for any inaccuracy or breach of any such representations or warranties under Sections 9.1(a)(i) or (b)(i) (but excluding claims for any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.4 and 3.15) or any breach of the covenants set forth in Sections 5.1 (but excluding claims for any breach of the covenants set forth in Section 5.1(b)(ix)), 5.2, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.11, 5.12, 5.13, 5.15, 5.16 or 5.17 more than Forty Million U.S. Dollars (US$40,000,000), in the aggregate, pursuant to this Section 9.1 or otherwise; provided further, that no amount shall be payable with respect to claims for any inaccuracy or breach of any such representations or warranties under Sections 9.1(a)(i) or (b)(i) (but excluding claims for any inaccuracy or breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.4 and 3.15) or any breach of the covenants set forth in Section 5.8 by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Sections 9.1(a)(i) or (b)(i) or Section 5.8 for any inaccuracy or breach of any such representation or warranty or covenant resulting in aggregate Losses of less than Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (US$500,000) with respect to any matter or series of related matters and such Losses shall not be included in calculating the threshold of US$6,000,000 referred to above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (v) Seller shall have no liability or obligation to Peabody or Buyer for any Loss to the extent the liability attributable to such Loss is reflected or reserved against (other than reserved for deferred Taxes) (but only to the extent so reflected or reserved) in the Final Closing Balance Sheet, and the amount of any such Loss, to the extent so reflected or reserved, shall not count toward any threshold referred to above; (w) any amount payable by an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Loss shall be reduced by any related insurance recovery received by the Indemnified Party (net of any costs incurred in order to obtain such recovery and the effect of any retrospective rate increase) and by any payments received by such Indemnified Party from third parties who are not Affiliates of such Indemnified Party; (x) if, in the Tax year the Loss occurred (or within the two subsequent Tax years (the "Benefit Period"), a Tax Benefit is actually realized by the Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof) as a result of such Loss, then promptly after the Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof) files a Tax Return claiming such Loss and realizes that Tax Benefit, the Indemnified Party will pay to the Indemnifying Party the Tax Benefit; provided, however, that such payment will not be made prior to the payment in full for such Loss by the Indemnifying Party; provided, further, that to the extent that such Tax Benefit is denied by a Taxing Authority, the Indemnifying Party shall refund to the Indemnified Party the amount of any payments previously made to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 9.1(c)(x) in respect of such Tax Benefit. Each of Peabody and Buyer shall (and shall cause each of its Affiliates controlled by it to) file all Tax Returns, use its reasonable best efforts which, for the avoidance of any doubt, shall not obligate Peabody, Buyer or any of its Affiliates to commence a legal proceeding or breach a written agreement to which it is a party, and take any action as reasonably necessary to realize all Tax Benefits that may be available during each Benefit Period; (y) the calculation of the amount of any Losses arising out of the breach of more than one representation or warranty shall be determined without duplication or double-counting of the same Loss; and (z) upon payment of any amount pursuant to a claim for indemnification hereunder, the Indemnifying Party (as defined in Section 9.1(d)) shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnified Party (as defined in Section 9.1(d)) against any third party with respect to the matters to which such claim relates. 64
"Tax Benefit" shall mean any amount by which the Tax liability of the Indemnified Party is reduced by reason of claiming a loss, deduction or credit for Tax purposes arising from the Loss in respect of which the indemnity payment was made, after giving effect to any Tax detriment to the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of the indemnification payment with respect to such Loss. For the purposes of this Agreement, where the Indemnified Party has other losses, deductions, credits or items available to it, the determination of any Tax Benefit shall be calculated by comparing the current Tax liability of the Indemnified Party, computed without regard to any losses, deductions, credits or items relating to the Loss, to the current Tax liability of the Indemnified Party after taking into account the losses, deductions, credits or items relating to the Loss. For the avoidance of doubt, no Tax Benefit will be taken to arise if the Indemnified Party does not have a liability for Tax in respect of the Benefit Period in which the Loss was incurred. (d) Notice and Opportunity to Defend. (i) If there occurs an event which a party (an "Indemnified Party") asserts is an indemnifiable event pursuant to Section 9.1(a) or 9.1(b), respectively, the Indemnified Party shall provide the other party obligated to provide indemnification (an "Indemnifying Party") promptly with written notice thereof, which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification. If such event involves (i) any claim or (ii) the commencement of any action or proceeding by a third Person (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party will give such Indemnifying Party prompt written notice of such claim or the commencement of such action or proceeding, which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for such claim or action to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party, but the failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such indemnifiable event is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to give such notice. (ii) If any Third-Party Claim is against an Indemnified Party and it gives notice to the Indemnifying Party of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the Indemnifying Party is also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of its financial capacity to defend such Third-Party Claim and provide indemnification with respect to such Third-Party Claim), to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Article IX for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) such assumption will conclusively establish for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Third-Party Claim are within the scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the 65
Indemnified Party's Consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims effected without its Consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party does not, within ten days after the Indemnified Party's notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be bound by any determination made in such Third-Party Claim or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Party. (iii) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing in this Section 9.1(d), if an Indemnified Party determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any determination of any Third-Party Claim so defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any compromise or settlement effected without its Consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld). (iv) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this Article IX: (i) both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, as the case may be, shall keep the other Person fully informed of the status of such Third-Party Claims and any related Proceedings at all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel, and (ii) the parties agree (each at its own expense) to render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim. (e) Other Damages. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no Indemnifying Party shall be liable to an Indemnified Party for any consequential or punitive damages. For purposes of this paragraph, consequential and punitive damages do not include out-of-pocket Losses incurred by an Indemnified Party and resulting from a Third Party Claim. 9.2 Specific Indemnification. (a) Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Peabody, Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries harmless from any and all Permitted Restructuring Tax Costs that are incurred. (b) Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Peabody, Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including the head company of any tax consolidated group of which the Company and its Subsidiaries are members) harmless from any liability for franking deficit tax (including any related interest and penalties) that becomes due and payable after Closing by Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including the head company of any tax consolidated group of which the Company and its Subsidiaries are members) to the extent that (i) 66
such an amount arises in respect of the next succeeding tax period ending after the Closing, and (ii) only to the extent that such amount relates to a refund, overpayment or overprovision of tax recognized in the Final Closing Balance Sheet or if the amount is not so recognized only to the extent that such amount becomes payable to Seller under Section 5.3(g) and (iii) only to the extent that such amount does not arise because of any payment or declaration of a dividend by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including the head company of any tax consolidated group of which the Company and its Subsidiaries are members) after Closing. (c) For the avoidance of doubt, any claim under this Section 9.2 shall not be reduced or otherwise mitigated because Peabody or the Buyer has consented to the Company Restructuring. 9.3 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments made under this Agreement (including for this purpose, all payments made under any provision of Section 5.3), whether pursuant to this Article IX or otherwise, shall be treated by Buyer and Seller as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. ARTICLE X GOODS & SERVICES TAX 10.1 Imposition of GST. The parties acknowledge that any amounts referred to in this Agreement do not include GST. If GST is or becomes payable on a supply made under or in connection with this Agreement, an additional amount ("Additional Amount") is payable by the recipient ("Recipient") equal to the amount of GST payable on that supply as calculated by the party making the supply ("Supplier") in accordance with the GST Law. The Additional Amount includes any penalties or interest imposed by the Australian Taxation Office ("ATO") on the Supplier due to late remittance of GST to the ATO. 10.2 Payment. The Additional Amount payable under Section 10.1 is payable at the same time and in the same manner as the consideration for the supply, and the Supplier shall provide the Recipient with a Tax Invoice within fourteen (14) days after the time of payment of the Additional Amount. 10.3 Reimbursements and Indemnities. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if an amount payable under or in connection with this Agreement (whether by way of reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise) is calculated by reference to an amount incurred by a party, whether by way of cost, expense, outlay, disbursement or otherwise ("Amount Incurred"), the amount payable shall be reduced by the amount of any Input Tax Credit to which that party is entitled in respect of that Amount Incurred. 10.4 Interpretation. Any reference in this Article 10 to: (a) an Input Tax Credit to which a party is entitled includes, without limitation, an Input Tax Credit arising from a Creditable Acquisition by that party but to which the Representative Member of a GST Group of which the party is a member is entitled; and 67
(b) a term that is not defined in this Agreement has the same meaning as in the A New Tax System (Goods & Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth). ARTICLE XI MISCELLANEOUS 11.1 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Seller, on the one hand, and Peabody and Buyer, on the other hand, shall bear their own expenses and the expenses of their respective Affiliates (including, in the case of Seller, the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, the Associated Companies and the Joint Ventures) in connection with the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller, on the one hand, and Peabody and Buyer, on the other hand, shall bear the fees and expenses of any broker or finder retained by such party and their respective Affiliates (including, in the case of Seller, the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, the Associated Companies and the Joint Ventures) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall bear responsibility for, and prior to the Closing shall pay, all fees and penalties associated with the termination, prepayment, refinancing or replacement of (and obtaining any Consents related to) the Debt of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the fees and penalties associated with obtaining any Consents related to interest rate swap agreements. 11.2 Governing Law.

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties; provided that either Seller or Buyer may assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more of their respective Affiliates and cause such Affiliate to perform such party's obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no assignment by either of Seller or Buyer to any of their respective Affiliates shall in any way affect such party's rights or relieve such party of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns any rights or remedies hereunder. 11.5 Waiver. Any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement which may be lawfully waived may be waived in writing at any time by each party which is entitled to the benefits thereof. Any waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement by any party hereto shall be binding only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. No failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of such provision and no waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to or 68
shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver. 11.6 Notices.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Business Unit's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial position of the RAG Colorado Business Unit at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the combined results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

RAG Colorado Business Unit (A Wholly Owned Business Unit of RAG American Coal Company as defined in Note 1 to the Combined Financial Statements) Notes to Combined Financial Statements (In thousands) December 31, 2003 1. BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION Twentymile Coal Company, RAG Empire Corporation, RAG Shoshone Coal Corporation and Colorado Yampa Coal Company (combined as RAG Colorado Business Unit) are wholly owned subsidiaries of RAG American Coal Company (RAG Coal) and were incorporated in Delaware on February 15, 1983, November 23, 1987, January 18, 1978 and August 23, 1982, respectively. On June 30, 1999, RAG Coal acquired the stock of Cyprus Amax Coal Company (Cyprus Coal), whose subsidiaries included RAG Colorado Business Unit, from Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (Cyprus Minerals) under the terms of a stock purchase and sale agreement dated May 12, 1999 (the Stock Purchase Agreement). Immediately thereafter, Cyprus Coal was merged into RAG Coal to form RAG American Coal Company and subsidiaries. RAG American Coal Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of RAG American Coal Holding, Inc. (RAG Holding). Collectively, RAG Coal and RAG Holding are referred to as the Parent. Initial capitalization of RAG Colorado was $238,171 of intercompany equity resulting from the net of the fair value of assets acquired less the fair value of liabilities assumed. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the acquisition cost has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Accompanying financial statements include the combined balance sheets of the RAG Colorado Business Unit (RAG Colorado) as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the related combined statements of operations, stockholder's equity, cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. RAG Colorado operates one underground longwall mine, Twentymile, located in Northwest Colorado. RAG Empire is an idled underground longwall operation also in Northwest Colorado while the other locations, Shoshone and Colorado Yampa, are closed, mined-out operations located in Southern Wyoming and Northwest Colorado, respectively. RAG Colorado is engaged in the extraction, cleaning and selling of coal to electric utilities and industrial users in the United States and Mexico. Significant interunit balances and transactions are eliminated in combination. 6

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and in banks. Cash balances in excess of amounts required for small operational requirements (petty cash) are administered and maintained by the Parent. INVENTORIES Coal inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with market defined as the estimated selling price, less estimated preparation and selling costs. The cost of coal inventories is determined based on average cost of product, which approximates first-in first-out (FIFO). Material and supplies inventories are valued at average cost, which approximates FIFO, less an allowance for obsolete and surplus items. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS As more fully discussed in Note 17, the combined financial statements of RAG Colorado for all periods presented include allocations of corporate expense from the Parent. In addition, all cash receipts and disbursements are conducted under the Parent's centralized cash management program and recorded in the intercompany accounts. PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT Costs for mineral rights and mine development costs incurred to expand capacity of operating mines or to develop new coal reserves are capitalized and charged to operations on the units-of-production method. Mobile mining equipment and most other assets are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives ranging from one to 20 years or on a units-of-production basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Major repairs and betterments, that significantly extend original useful lives or improve productivity, are capitalized and depreciated over the period benefited. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. 7

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered impaired; the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. INCOME TAXES Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. RAG Colorado is included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return of RAG Holding. Income tax expense has been calculated and is shared with RAG Holding as if RAG Colorado was filing a separate tax return. The business unit does not have a written tax sharing agreement with its Parent. ADVANCE MINING ROYALTIES Rights to leased coal lands are often acquired through royalty payments. Advance mining royalties are advance payments made to lessors under terms of mineral lease agreements that are recoverable from future production. These advance payments are deferred and charged to operations as the coal reserves are mined. In instances where advance payments are not expected to be recoverable from future production, no asset is recognized and the scheduled payments are expenses as incurred. Advance mining royalties deferred are recorded in Other Current and Noncurrent Assets. 8

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses have carrying values which approximate fair value due to the short maturity or the financial nature of these instruments. RAG Colorado has no other financial instruments. REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognized on coal sales when title passes to the customer, in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement, which generally occurs when the coal is loaded into transport carriers at the mine for shipment to the customer. FREIGHT REVENUE AND COSTS Shipping and handling costs paid to third-party carriers and invoiced to coal customers are recorded as freight expense, included in cost of sales, and coal sales, respectively. INTEREST INCOME Interest income represents interest received from related parties on certain receivable balances that are netted in Due to Parent. The remaining components of the Due to Parent are non-interest bearing. WORKERS COMPENSATION AND PNEUMOCONIOSIS (BLACK LUNG) BENEFITS RAG Colorado is self-insured for workers compensation claims in Colorado and a subscriber to the mandatory state fund in Wyoming. The liability for workers compensation claims is an actuarially determined estimate of the ultimate losses incurred on known claims plus a provision for incurred but not reported claims. This probable ultimate liability is re-determined annually and resultant adjustments are expensed. These obligations are included in the combined balance sheets as other current and noncurrent liabilities. 9
RAG Colorado Business Unit (A Wholly Owned Business Unit of RAG American Coal Company as defined in Note 1 to the Combined Financial Statements) Notes to Combined Financial Statements (continued) (In thousands) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) WORKERS COMPENSATION AND PNEUMOCONIOSIS (BLACK LUNG) BENEFITS (CONTINUED) RAG Colorado is required by federal and state statutes to provide benefits to employees for awards related to black lung. RAG Colorado is self-insured for these benefits and funds benefit payments through a Section 501 (c) (21) tax-exempt trust fund maintained by the Parent for all of its subsidiaries. Provisions are made for estimated benefits based on annual evaluations prepared by outside actuaries. RAG Colorado accounts for its participation in the Section 501 (c) (21) trust as a participant in the Parent sponsored benefit plan. Accordingly, assets and liabilities for the trust are not allocated to the participants and are not presented in the accompanying combined balance sheets. RAG Colorado's participation in the trust requires that it fund the net periodic benefit costs allocated to its employees by the Parent. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS Pensions and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits are provided to retirees of RAG Colorado through defined benefit plans maintained by the Parent. RAG Colorado accounts for these plans as a participant in the Parent sponsored plan; therefore, assets and liabilities are not allocated to the participants and are not presented in the accompanying combined balance sheets. RAG Colorado's participation in these Parent sponsored plans requires that they currently fund the net periodic benefit costs attributable to their employees. These net periodic benefits costs are calculated annually by outside actuaries in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, respectively. Long-term disability benefits are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 112, Employers Accounting for Post Employment Benefits, and actuarially determined obligations for these benefits are included in the combined balance sheets. 10
RAG Colorado Business Unit (A Wholly Owned Business Unit of RAG American Coal Company as defined in Note 1 to the Combined Financial Statements) Notes to Combined Financial Statements (continued) (In thousands) 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of the combined financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the combined financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates relate to quantity and quality of mineral reserves; asset retirement obligations; employee and retiree benefit liabilities; future cash flows associated with assets; useful lives for depreciation, depletion, and amortization; and fair value of financial instruments. Due to the prospective nature of these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimated. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS Effective January 1, 2003, RAG Colorado initially adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (Statement 143) and accordingly changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations. RAG Colorado's asset retirement obligations consist principally of costs to reclaim support acreage and perform other related functions at underground mine operations. Statement 143 requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which the legal obligation associated with the retirement of the tangible long-lived asset is incurred. When the liability is initially recorded, the offset is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. To settle the liability, the obligation is paid, and to the extent there is a difference between the liability and the amount of cash paid, a gain or loss upon settlement is incurred. The Company periodically reviews its estimated future cash flows for its asset retirement obligations. Under its previous accounting method, the Company accrued the estimated future costs to reclaim the support acreage and to perform other related functions at underground mines ratably over the lives of the mines. 11

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (CONTINUED) As a result of adoption of Statement 143, the Company recognized an increase in the total reclamation liability of $415, a decrease in mining properties and mineral rights, net of accumulated depletion, of $2,951 related to amounts recorded in previous asset purchase transactions from assumption of pre-acquisition reclamation liabilities, a decrease in net deferred tax liability of $1,279 and a cumulative effect of a change in accounting, net of tax of $2,087. The following table describes all changes to the Company's reclamation liability from January 1, 2003, the date of adoption, through December 31, 2003: On a pro-forma basis, assuming the application of Statement 143 to all periods presented, the asset retirement obligation at January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2002 would have been $8,151 and $7,375, respectively. 3.

PROPERTY, PLANT, EQUIPMENT AND COAL RESERVES (CONTINUED) Leaseholds in coal reserves and coal reserves in owned surface lands (collectively referred to as coal reserves) are a result of additional costs being allocated to the underlying purchased assets at the time of acquisition. These costs are charged to operations on a units-of-production basis over the life of the coal reserves acquired. These coal reserves are a combination of leased coal mineral rights and mineral rights held through fee ownership. The amounts recognized in connection with the purchase price allocation in many cases would vary if the assets had been recognized at fair value. Amortization expense related to leaseholds in coal reserves amounted to $6,049, $10,906 and, $11,095 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Amortization expense related to owned surface lands amounted to $5,359 for the year ended December 31, 2003. No owned surface lands were mined during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. 6. OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS Other noncurrent assets consisted of the following at December 31: 14

INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED) The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following at December 31: In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred taxes will be realized. 17

INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED) The following is a reconciliation between the amount determined by applying the federal statutory rate of 35% to income before income taxes and the actual income tax expense for the years ended December 31: 10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Substantially all employees of RAG Colorado participate in the Parent sponsored defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance plans. RAG Colorado recorded the following net periodic benefit costs for these plans in cost of coal sales in the combined statements of operations for the years ended December 31: These amounts were settled with RAG Coal by crediting the Due to Parent account. 18
RAG Colorado Business Unit (A Wholly Owned Business Unit of RAG American Coal Company as defined in Note 1 to the Combined Financial Statements) Notes to Combined Financial Statements (continued) (In thousands) 10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (CONTINUED) In December of 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was enacted in the U.S. The Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide a benefit that meets certain criteria. The Parent's other postretirement plans covering retirees currently provide certain prescription benefits to eligible participants. Because the Act was only recently passed, the Parent has not evaluated the impact of the Act's benefits and subsidies on the accumulated benefit obligation for other postretirement benefits. The Parent has not determined what changes would be required to the current benefits provided to allow the Parent and its subsidiaries to qualify for the federal subsidy. Further analysis of the Act and its impact on the Parent and RAG Colorado will take place in 2004. RAG Colorado also participates in a number of postemployment plans covering severance, disability income and continuation of health care and life insurance for disabled employees. The accumulated postemployment benefit liabilities consisted of the following as of December 31: These amounts are included in Accrued Expenses and Other Noncurrent Liabilities, respectively. 11. PNEUMOCONIOSIS (BLACK LUNG) EXPENSE AND TRUST For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 RAG Colorado made provisions for black lung benefits of $26, $0, and $0, respectively, that are included in cost of coal sales in the combined statements of operations. RAG Colorado satisfies its financial assurance responsibility for self-insured Federal Black Lung benefits through participation in the Parent's 501 (c) (21) Trust. The Parent's 501(c) (21) Trust assets exceeded the Parent's recorded obligation. The black lung costs allocated to RAG Colorado represent a pro-rata allocation of the net black lung costs incurred by the Parent. Black lung costs of RAG Colorado may have been higher if they were not a participant in the Parent's Trust. 19

WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS Workers compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $1,575, $957, and $1,426, respectively, and is included in cost of coal sales in the combined statements of operations. RAG Colorado satisfies its self-insured workers compensation financial assurance responsibility to the State of Colorado through a surety bond in the amount of $4,674, which is fully collateralized by a letter of credit issued by RAG Coal International AG, the Parent company of RAG Holding. 13. LEASE AND MINERAL ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS RAG Colorado leases mineral interests from the State of Colorado, the U.S. Government and other various lessors. Some of the mineral leases require annual minimum royalty payments, whereas others require payments at the time of production or shipment. A substantial amount of the coal mined by RAG Colorado is produced from reserves leased from the owner of the coal. Annual minimum royalties are expensed when paid if they are not recoverable against future production of shipments. All of the mineral leases are subject to cancellation by RAG Colorado. Rentals and mineral royalties charged to cost of coal sales during the years ended December 31 were as follows: Payment of certain mineral royalties are secured by surety bonds issued in favor of the U.S. Department Interior in the amount of $482 at December 31, 2003. 20

OTHER REVENUES AND OTHER INCOME Other revenues and other income consisted of the following for the years ended December 31: 15. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS The Company markets its coal to electric utilities in the United States and Mexico. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer's financial condition and collateral is generally not required. Receivables consist of amounts billed and currently due from customers. The Company has an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce its receivables to their net realizable value. Management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on various factors including aging of receivables and historical collection experience. Credit losses are provided for in the combined financial statements and historically have been minimal. The Company is committed under long-term contracts to supply coal that meets certain quality requirements at specified prices. RAG Colorado's deliveries under the coal sales contract with Commission Federale de Electricidad, a Mexican utility, are backed with a performance bond in the amount of $6,704.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED) Certain sales and administrative services are performed on a shared services basis by the Parent and are charged to RAG Colorado and other subsidiaries on an allocated basis. These charges encompass sales and marketing, property and liability insurance, information technology, employee benefit plan administration, human resource administration, cash management, real estate administration, legal services, corporate secretarial services, environmental management, safety, purchasing and certain accounting services. Allocation methods used by the Parent to charge its subsidiaries for these shared services include relative production and sales volumes, relative insurable values, relative employee counts, and relative amount of staff time spent. The amounts charged for shared services are not necessarily representative of amounts that RAG Colorado might spend to obtain such services on a stand-alone basis. The amounts charged and their classification in the Combined Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31 are: When the Parent acquired the stock of Cyprus Amax Coal on June 30, 1999, it funded a portion of the purchase price through term loans from three international banks. As part of the documentation for this transaction, the Parent executed a Pledge Agreement granting the banks a security interest in the shares of specified subsidiaries of the Parent. The subsidiaries comprising RAG Colorado are among these specified subsidiaries. Interest expense related to this debt has historically not been allocated by the Parent to its subsidiaries and is not included in the accompanying Combined Statements of Operations. 24

RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 1 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) (b) PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION (CONTINUED) TRANSACTIONS ELIMINATED ON CONSOLIDATION Unrealised gains and losses and inter-entity balances resulting from transactions with or between controlled entities are eliminated in full on consolidation. Unrealised gains resulting from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the consolidated entity's interest. Unrealised gains relating to associates and joint venture entities are eliminated against the carrying amount of the investment. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, unless they evidence a recoverable impairment. (c) REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenues are recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST). SALE OF COAL Revenue from the sale of coal is recognised (net of returns, discounts and allowances) when control of the goods passes to the customer. INTEREST REVENUE Interest revenue is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the financial asset. SALE OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS The gross proceeds of non-current asset sales are included as revenue at the date control of the asset passes to the buyer, usually when an unconditional contract of sale is signed. The gain or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset at the time of disposal and the net proceeds on disposal. RENTAL REVENUE Rental revenue is recognised as it accrues. DIVIDEND REVENUE Revenue from dividends from investments in other entities are recognised when received. OTHER REVENUE Revenue recognition policies for investments are described in Accounting Policy Note 1(m). (d) BORROWING COSTS Borrowing costs include interest. Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred unless they relate to qualifying assets. Qualifying assets are assets which generally take more than 12 months to get ready for their intended use or sale. In these circumstances, borrowing costs are capitalised to the cost of the assets. F6
RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 1 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) (e) GOODS AND SERVICES TAX Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST), except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Tax Office (ATO). In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the expense. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO is included as a current asset or liability in the statement of financial position. Cash flows are included in the statement of cash flows on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO are classified as operating cash flows. (f) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Foreign currency transactions are translated to Australian currency at the rates of exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions. Amounts receivable and payable in foreign currencies at balance date are translated at the rates of exchange ruling on that date. Exchange differences relating to amounts payable and receivable in foreign currencies are brought to account as exchange gains or losses in the statement of financial performance in the financial year in which the exchange rates change. HEDGES Anticipated transactions Where hedge transactions are designated as a hedge of the anticipated purchase or sale of goods or services, or purchase of qualifying assets, gains and losses, on the hedge arising up to the date of the anticipated transaction, together with any costs or gains arising at the time of entering the hedge, are deferred and included in the measurement of the anticipated transaction when the transaction has occurred as designated. Any gains or losses on the hedge transaction after that date are included in the statement of financial performance. When the anticipated transaction is no longer expected to occur as designated the deferred gains and losses relating to the hedged transaction are recognised immediately in the statement of financial performance. Where a hedge transaction is terminated early and the anticipated transaction is still expected to occur as designated, the deferred gains and losses that arose on the hedge prior to its termination continue to be deferred and are included in the measurement of the purchase or sale when it occurs. Where a hedge transaction is terminated early because the anticipated transaction is no longer expected to occur as designated, deferred gains and losses that arose on the foreign currency hedge prior to its termination are included in the statement of financial performance for the period. F7
RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 1 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) (f) FOREIGN CURRENCY (CONTINUED) Where a hedge is redesignated as a hedge of another transaction, gains and losses arising on the hedge prior to its redesignation are only deferred where the original anticipated transaction is still expected to occur as designated. When the original anticipated transaction is no longer expected to occur as designated, any gains or losses relating to the hedge instrument are included in the statement of financial performance for the period. Gains and losses that arise prior to and upon the maturity of transactions entered into under hedge rollover strategies are deferred and included in the measurement of the hedged anticipated transaction if the transaction is still expected to occur as designated. If the anticipated transaction is no longer expected to occur as designated, the gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of financial performance. Other hedges All other hedge transactions are initially recorded at the relevant rate at the date of the transaction. Hedges outstanding at balance date are valued at the rates ruling on that date and any gains or losses are brought to account in the statement of financial performance. Costs or gains arising at the time of entering into the hedge are deferred and amortised over the life of the hedge. (g) TAXATION The consolidated entity adopts the income statement liability method of tax effect accounting. Income tax expense is calculated on operating profit adjusted for permanent differences between taxable and accounting income. The tax effect of timing differences, which arise from items being brought to account in different periods for income tax and accounting purposes, is carried forward in the balance sheet as a future income tax benefit or a provision for deferred income tax. Future income tax benefits are not brought to account unless realisation of the asset is assured beyond reasonable doubt. Future income tax benefits relating to tax losses are only brought to account when their realisation is virtually certain. The tax effect of capital losses is not brought to recorded unless realisation is virtually certain. (h) ACQUISITION OF ASSETS All assets acquired including property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at their cost of acquisition at the date of acquisition, being the fair value of the consideration provided plus incidental costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable are recorded at their present value, discounted at the rate applicable to the company if similar borrowing were obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions. The costs of assets constructed or internally generated by the consolidated entity, other than goodwill, include the cost of materials and direct labour. Directly attributable overheads and other incidental costs are also capitalised to the asset. Borrowing costs are capitalised to qualifying assets as set out in Note 1(d) Expenditure other than research and development, is only recognised as an asset when the entity controls future economic benefits as a result of costs incurred, it is probable that those future economic benefits will eventuate, and costs can be measured reliably.

RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 1 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) (h) ACQUISITION OF ASSETS (CONTINUED) SUBSEQUENT ADDITIONAL COSTS Costs incurred on assets subsequent to initial acquisition are capitalised when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess of the originally assessed performance of the asset will flow to the company in future years. Costs that do not meet the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred. (i) REVISIONS OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively in current and future periods only. (j) CASH ASSETS Cash assets are carried at face value of the amounts deposited. The carrying amounts of cash assets approximate net fair value. (k) RECEIVABLES The collectability of debts is assessed at year-end and specific provision made for any doubtful accounts. TRADE DEBTORS Trade debtors to be settled within 60 days are carried at amounts due. (l) INVENTORIES Coal stocks are valued at the lower of average cost of production and net realisable value. Cost of production includes direct production costs and an appropriate allocation of fixed and variable overheads. Materials and supplies are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. (m) INVESTMENTS Investments in other unlisted entities are carried at the lower of cost and recoverable amount based on the underlying net assets of the company. F9
RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 1 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) (n) LEASED ASSETS Leases of plant and equipment under which the company assumes substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership are classified as finance leases. Other leases are classified as operating leases. FINANCE LEASES Finance leases are capitalised. A lease asset and a lease liability equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments are recorded at the inception of the lease. Lease liabilities are reduced by repayments of principal. The interest components of the lease payments are expensed. Contingent rentals are expensed as incurred. Capitalised lease assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease, or where it is likely the group will obtain ownership of the asset, the life of the asset. OPERATING LEASES Payments made under operating leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, except where an alternative basis is more representative of the pattern of benefits to be derived from the leased property. (o) RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS VALUED ON COST BASIS The carrying amounts of all non-current assets valued on cost basis other than exploration and evaluation expenditure carried forward (refer Note 1(q)), are reviewed to determine whether they are in excess of their recoverable amount at balance date. If the carrying amount of a non-current asset exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is written down to the lower amount. The write-down is recognised as an expense in the net profit or loss in the reporting period in which it occurs. In assessing recoverable amounts of non-current assets the relevant cash flows have not been discounted to their present value, except where specifically stated. Except where specifically stated, non-current assets are recorded at the lower of cost and recoverable amount. (p) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION Items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost and depreciated as outlined below. The cost of property, plant and equipment constructed by the company includes the cost of materials and direct labour. The proportion of overheads and other incidental costs directly attributable to its construction are also capitalised to the cost of property, plant and equipment. USEFUL LIVES Items of property, plant and equipment, including mining equipment under lease are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. This takes into account production output so as to write-off the net cost of each asset over the shorter of its expected useful life or the production life of the mine at which the asset is sited. The depreciation rates used for mining property, plant and equipment appropriate 5% to 20% F10
RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 1 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) (p) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION (CONTINUED) Assets are depreciated or amortised from the date of acquisition or, in respect of internally constructed assets, from the time an asset is completed and held ready for use. (q) EXPLORATION, EVALUATION AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE Exploration, evaluation and development costs are accumulated in respect of each separate area of interest. Exploration and evaluation costs are carried forward where right of tenure of the area of interest is current and they are expected to be recouped through sale or successful development and exploitation of the area of interest, or, where evaluation and activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage that permits reasonable assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves. Development costs related to an area of interest are carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recouped either through sale or successful exploitation of the area of interest. When an area of interest is abandoned or the directors decide that it is not commercial, any accumulated costs in respect of that area are written off in the financial period the decision is made. Each area of interest is also reviewed at the end of each accounting period and accumulated costs written off to the extent that they will not be recoverable in the future. Amortisation is not charged on costs carried forward in respect of areas of interest in the development phase until production commences. When production commences, carried forward evaluation and development costs are amortised on a units of production basis over the life of the economically recoverable reserves. (r) PAYABLES Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods or services received. Trade accounts payable are normally settled within 60 days. (s) EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS WAGES, SALARIES, ANNUAL LEAVE Liabilities for employee benefits for wages, salaries (including non-monetary benefits), and annual leave to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date representing present obligations resulting from employees' services provided up to the reporting date, calculated at undiscounted amounts based on remuneration rates that the company expects to pay as at reporting date including related on-costs. F11
RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 1 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) (s) EMPLOYEE ENTITLEMENTS (CONTINUED) LONG SERVICE LEAVE The liability for employees' entitlements to long service leave is only accrued for those employees not covered by the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund and represents the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the employer resulting from employees' services provided up to balance date, including related on-costs. For those employees covered by the Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave Fund no provision is recorded by the consolidated entity as the liability for payment of long service leave is reimbursed from the Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Fund. The consolidated entity accrues for all levy's charged by the Fund as incurred. SUPERANNUATION PLAN The Company contributes to several defined contribution superannuation plans. Contributions are charged against income as they are made. (t) PROVISIONS A provision is recognised when a legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the timing or amount of which is uncertain. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows (adjusted for expected future risks) required to settle the obligation at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability, being risk free rates on government bonds most closely matching the expected future payments, except where noted below. The unwinding of the discount is treated as part of the expense related to the particular provision. When some or all of the economic benefit required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the recovery will be received and is measured on a basis consistent with the measurement of the related provision. In the statement of financial performance, the expense recognised in respect of a provision is presented net of the recovery. In the statement of financial position, the provision is recognised net of the recovery receivable when the company: - has a legal recognised right to set-off the recovery receivable and the provision; and - intends to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the provision simultaneously.

RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 1 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) (t) PROVISIONS (CONTINUED) RESTORATION Provisions are made for mine site rehabilitation and restoration on an incremental basis during the course of mine life. Provisions, which are determined on an undiscounted basis, include the following costs: reclamation, plant closure, waste site closure and monitoring activities. These costs have been determined on the basis of current costs, current legal requirements and current technology. Changes in estimates are dealt with on a prospective basis. Significant uncertainty exists as to the amount of restoration obligations which will be incurred due to the following factors: - Uncertainty as to the remaining life of existing sites - The impact of changes in environmental legislation. Assumptions have been made as to the remaining life of existing sites based on studies conducted by independent technical advisors. Such studies are conducted at least once in each three year period.

The Company has no dilutive shares. F30
RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 22 UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES DISCLOSURES (CONTINUED) (a) Exploration, evaluation and development costs Under Australian GAAP, exploration, evaluation and development costs are accumulated in respect of each separate area of interest. Exploration and evaluation costs are deferred where right of tenure of the area of interest is current and they are expected to be recouped through sale or successful development and exploitation of the area of interest, or, where evaluation and activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage that permits reasonable assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves. Development costs related to an area of interest are deferred to the extent they are expected to be recouped either through sale or successful exploitation of the area of interest. When an area of interest is abandoned or the directors decide that it is not commercial, any accumulated costs in respect to that area are written off in the financial period the decision is made. Each area of interest is also reviewed at the end of each accounting period and accumulated costs written off to the extent they will not be recoverable in the future. Under U.S. GAAP, exploration and evaluation costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs incurred to develop coal mines or to expand the capacity of operating mines are capitalised. All other development costs are charged to operating costs as incurred. (b) Deferred costs Under Australian GAAP, all costs incurred in relation to setting up existing longwall equipment is deferred and amortised on a unit of production basis over the relevant longwall panel. These costs include surveying prospective panels and physically moving the longwall equipment. Under U.S. GAAP, such costs are expensed as incurred, unless they relate to the initial set-up of new longwall equipment. RAG have not incurred any costs associated with set-up of new longwall equipment in respect of the two years ended December 31, 2003. F31
RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 22 UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES DISCLOSURES (CONTINUED) (c) Provision for restoration Under Australian GAAP, provisions are recorded for mine site rehabilitation on an incremental basis during the course of mine life. Provisions, which are determined on an undiscounted basis, include the following costs: reclamation, plant closure, waste site closure and monitoring activities. These costs have been determined on the basis of current costs, current legal requirements and current technology. Changes in estimates are dealt with on a prospective basis. Significant uncertainty exists as to the amount of restoration obligations which will be incurred due to the following factors: (a) uncertainty as to the remaining life of existing sites; and (b) the impact of changes in environmental legislation. Assumptions are made as to the remaining life of existing sites based on studies conducted by independent technical advisors. Such studies are conducted at least once in each three-year period. This policy was consistent in most major respects with the requirements under U.S. GAAP until June 2001 when the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS No. 143). SFAS No. 143 requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that results from the acquisition, construction, development or normal use of the assets. The enterprise should also record a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset (i.e., the associated asset retirement costs) and depreciate that cost over the life of the asset. The liability is adjusted each period to reflect the passage of time (i.e., accretion expense) and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement. Because of the extensive use of estimates, many enterprises will record a gain or loss when they settle the obligation. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002 (effective January 1, 2003 for RAG Australia Coal). On initial adoption of SFAS No. 143, RAG Australia Coal recorded a cumulative loss of $2,265,000, net of increased depreciation and accretion expenses, increased the carrying amount of mining property and equipment by $5,637,000 and increased the provision for restoration by $7,902,000. In accordance with U.S. GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2003, RAG Australia Coal recorded depreciation and accretion charges associated with restoration provisions of $656,000 and $1,095,000 compared to the $3,310,000 expense recorded under Australian GAAP. Under Australian GAAP, a component of the restoration provisions is recorded against accumulated depreciation. Under U.S. GAAP, this provision would be reclassified into non-current liabilities. No adjustment to equity would result from this reclassification. F32
RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 22 UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES DISCLOSURES (CONTINUED) (d) Depreciation of non-current assets Under Australian GAAP, items of property, plant and equipment, including mining equipment under lease are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. This takes into account production output so as to write-off the net cost of each asset over the shorter of its expected useful life or the production life of the mine at which the asset is sited. This is consistent in most major respects with U.S. GAAP. Under Australian GAAP, deferred exploration, evaluation and development costs are capitalised (refer Note 22 (a)) and depreciated on a units of production basis over the life of the economically recoverable reserves from the point at which production commences. Under U.S. GAAP, these costs are expensed as incurred. Accordingly, the annual depreciation charge recorded under Australian GAAP is reduced for U.S. GAAP to the extent that the underlying assets are written-off in Note 22 (a). (e) Redeemable preference shares As disclosed in Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements each redeemable preference share entitles the holder to the same voting rights as ordinary share holders and may be redeemed at any time for the amount paid to the Company as determined by a resolution of the directors of RAG Australia Coal Pty Limited. In the event of the winding up of the Company, each redeemable preference share carries a right in priority to any other class of shares only as to the amount paid to the Company on the issue of the redeemable preference share. Dividends payable in respect of redeemable preference shares are determined by the Board in its absolute discretion. Under Australian GAAP these shares are classified as contributed equity. For U.S. GAAP purposes, this amount has been reclassified to debt in the statement of financial position on the basis that the shares are redeemable in cash only and cannot be converted to ordinary shares under any circumstance and carry preferential rights on winding-up. F33
RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 22 UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES DISCLOSURES (CONTINUED) (f) Deferred income taxes Deferred income taxes are accounted for under the liability method for Australian GAAP purposes, which is equivalent in most major respects to U.S. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under U.S. GAAP, all deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be recognised on the Statement of Financial Position, and a valuation allowance recorded against any deferred tax assets to the extent it is not 'more likely than not' that they will be realised. Under Australian GAAP, deferred tax assets related to temporary differences are brought to account when it is assured 'beyond a reasonable doubt' and tax losses carried forward must past a 'virtually certain' threshold. The definition of 'more likely than not' is a level of likelihood that is more than 50 percent, which is considered a lesser recognition threshold than the 'virtually certain' criterion. Deferred tax assets of $2,296,000 carried forward have been recognized for U.S. GAAP purposes the year ended December 31, 2003, which have not been recognized for Australian GAAP. As a full valuation allowance would be recorded against these assets for U.S. GAAP purposes as the realization of the deferred tax assets is not considered more likely than not. Under Australian GAAP, deferred taxes are not recorded on the fair value of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment acquired through a business combination. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on acquisition, based on the difference between the fair value and tax value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities on acquisition is adjusted against the carrying value of goodwill recognized on acquisition. This differing accounting treatment did not give rise to any equity or income adjustments for the consolidated entity during the two years ended December 31, 2003. (g) Acquired mineral tenements Under Australian GAAP, the cost of mining rights and reserves acquired under a business combination or asset purchase are capitalised as 'exploration, evaluation and development expenditure' and amortised on a units of production basis. Under U.S. GAAP, these costs would be classified as either 'Land and Coal Interests' or "Leased Coal Interests' (i.e., other intangible asset) and amortised on a consistent basis with Australian GAAP. This reclassification does not impact either shareholder's equity or the Statement of Financial Performance. The potential impairment of these assets has been considered in accordance with SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" and no adjustment has been recorded against the carrying value of these assets to comply with U.S. GAAP. F34
RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 22 UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES DISCLOSURES (CONTINUED) (h) Sale of non-current assets Under Australian GAAP, proceeds from the sale of non-current assets are recorded as other revenues from ordinary activities and the basis of the assets sold is included in expenses. Under U.S. GAAP, the difference between the sales proceeds and the cost basis of the assets sold is presented as a net gain or loss and included in the determination of operating income. (i) Recently issued U.S. accounting pronouncements In June 2001 the FASB issued Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations", and Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets". Statement No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations completed after June 30, 2001 and also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill and those acquired intangible assets that are required to be included in goodwill. Statement No. 142 will require that goodwill no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. Statement No. 142 will also require recognized intangible assets to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (Statement No. 144.) Any recognized intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life will not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment in accordance with Statement No. 142 until its life is determined to no longer be indefinite. The provisions of Statement No. 141 are applicable to all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method for which the date of acquisition is July 1, 2001, or later. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of Statement No. 142 on January 1, 2002. Retroactive application of Statements No. 141 and No. 142 is not permitted. However, any goodwill and any intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a business combination completed after June 30, 2001 will not be amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before July 1, 2001 will continue to be amortized until June 30, 2002. The adoption of Statement No. 141 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP. The Company implemented Statement No. 142 on January 1, 2002. The Company determined that the value of acquired mineral tenements was not impaired as of January 1, 2002 or subsequently. F35
RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 22 UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES DISCLOSURES (CONTINUED) (i) Recently issued U.S. accounting pronouncements (continued) In August 2001 the FASB issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets". Statement No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and will supersede (a) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121 with respect to the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and (b) Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 (APB Opinion No. 30) for the disposal of a segment of a business. Statement No. 144 retains the requirements of Statement No. 121 to (a) recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and (b) measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. Statement No. 144 also requires that a long lived asset to be abandoned, exchanged for a similar productive asset, or distributed to owners in a spin off be considered held and used until the asset is disposed of, exchanged or distributed. Statement No. 144 retains the basic provisions of APB Opinion No. 30 for the presentation of discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity (rather than a segment of a business). A component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the entity. A component of an entity that is classified as held for sale or that has been disposed of is presented as a discontinued operations if the operations and cash flows of the component will be (or have been) eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component. In addition, discontinued operations are no longer measured on a net realizable value basis, and future operating losses are no longer recognized before they occur. The Company implemented Statement No. 144 on January 1, 2002. This statement did not have a material impact on the Company's results or financial position on the date of adoption. In April 2002 the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No.4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." As a result of the rescission of Statement No.4, the loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in the year ended June 30, 2002 is no longer presented as an extraordinary item upon the adoption of Statement No.145, which is effective from July 1, 2002. In July 2002 the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." Statement No. 146 is based on the general principle that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity should be recorded when it is incurred and initially measured at fair value. Statement No. 146 applies to costs associated with (1) an exit activity that does not involve an entity newly acquired in a business combination, or (2) a disposal activity within the scope of Statement No. 144. These costs include certain termination benefits, costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease, and other associated costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees. This statement did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results or financial position on the date of adoption. F36
RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 22 UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES DISCLOSURES (CONTINUED) (i) Recently issued U.S. accounting pronouncements (continued) In October 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 147, "Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions." The adoption of Statement No. 147 did not have a material impact on the Company's results or financial position under U.S. GAAP. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of Statement No. 123." This Statement amends Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of voluntarily transitioning to the fair value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. Statement No. 148 also amends the disclosure requirements of Statement No. 123 to require more prominent disclosure of the method used to account for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method on reported results in both annual and interim Financial statements. The disclosure provisions are effective for the Company from January 1, 2002. The adoption of Statement No. 148 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results or financial position under U.S. GAAP. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others." This Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued. This Interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 and have not had a material effect on the Company's financial statements. The adoption of this interpretation has not resulted in any additional disclosure as the Company has not provided any guarantees of indebtedness to others. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." This Interpretation requires the consolidation of entities that cannot finance their activities without the support of other parties and that lack certain characteristics of a controlling interest, such as the ability to make decisions about the entity's activities via voting rights or similar rights. In October 2003, the FASB postponed the applicability of Interpretation 4b to many variable interest entities. This Interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after January 31, 2003. For companies with a variable interest in a variable interest entity created before February 1, 2003, this Interpretation, as amended, applies no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. This Interpretation requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after January 31, 2003 if it is reasonably possible that the Company will consolidate or disclose information about variable interest entities when the Interpretation becomes effective. This Interpretation did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results or financial position on the date of adoption. F37
RAG AUSTRALIA COAL PTY LIMITED AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 22 UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES DISCLOSURES (CONTINUED) (i) Recently issued U.S. accounting pronouncements (continued) In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, "Amendment of Statement No. 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This Statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This Statement requires contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly. In particular, this Statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in Statement No. 133. In addition, it clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows. Statement No. 149 amends certain other existing pronouncements. This Statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, except for hedging relationship designated after June 30, 2003. The provisions of this Statement that relate to Statement No. 133 implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003, should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates. In addition, certain provisions relating to forward purchases or sales of when-issued securities or other securities that do not yet exist, should be applied to existing contracts as well as new contracts entered into after June 30, 2003. The adoption of Statement No. 149 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results or financial position under U.S. GAAP. In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity." This statement requires issuers to classify as liabilities (or assets in some circumstances) three classes of freestanding financial instruments (presently classified as equity) that embody obligations for the issuer. Generally, this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results or financial position under U.S. GAAP. F38
