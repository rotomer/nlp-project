of proving that the Underwriters sold Securities to the person alleging such loss, claim, damage, liability or action without sending or giving, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to the Underwriters within a reasonable amount of time prior to such sale or such confirmation, and the Underwriters failed to deliver the corrected Prospectus, if required by law to have so delivered it and if delivered would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage, liability or action.

     (b) Each Underwriter shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, their respective officers, each of their respective directors, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any Blue Sky Application, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any Blue Sky Application, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of that Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party
provided, however
provided further,
 
thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , that Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated shall have the right to employ one counsel to represent jointly Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and those other Underwriters and their respective directors, officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company under this Section 8 if, in the reasonable judgment of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, it is advisable for Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and those Underwriters, directors, officers, employees and controlling persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company. No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include any findings of fact or admissions of fault or culpability as to the indemnified party or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
provided, however
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed
 
to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, on the one hand, and the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the Securities purchased under this Agreement, on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the Securities under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8 were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 8 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 8(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by it was resold to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to their respective Purchase obligations and not joint.
     (e) The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors acknowledge that the statements with respect to the public offering of the Securities by the Underwriters set forth on the cover page of, the third and the sixth paragraphs, and the second sentence of the fourth paragraph, appearing under the caption "Underwriting" in, the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
               SECTION 9.
Defaulting Underwriters.
               If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such Closing Date in the respective proportions which the amount of the Notes set forth opposite the name of each remaining non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto bears to the total amount of Notes set forth opposite the names of all the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters in Schedule 1 hereto; , , that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not
provided
however
 
be obligated to purchase any of the Notes on such Closing Date if the total amount of the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date exceeds 10% of the total amount of Notes to be purchased on such Closing Date, and any remaining non-defaulting Underwriter shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the amount of Notes which it agreed to purchase on such Closing Date pursuant to the terms of Section 2. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other Underwriters satisfactory to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, in such proportion as may be agreed upon among them, all of the Notes to be purchased on such Closing Date. If the remaining Underwriters or other Underwriters satisfactory to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated do not elect to purchase the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such Closing Date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses to the extent set forth in Sections 6 and 11.

MORGAN STANLEY & CO. INCORPORATED CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON LLC CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC. -
               We have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-109906), filed by the Company and the Guarantors under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as it became effective under the Securities Act; the Company's and the Guarantor's prospectus, dated March 8, 2004, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement, dated March 12, 2004 (the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company and the Guarantor pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act, which pursuant to Form S-3 incorporates by reference or is deemed to incorporate by reference the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 and the Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company filed on March 10, 2004 (collectively, the "Exchange Act Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); the indenture dated as of March 23, 2004 (the "Indenture") among the Company, the Guarantors and US Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee") relating to the Notes and the related guarantees of the Guarantors, the terms of which are set forth in the Indenture (the "Guarantees"); the global notes representing the Notes and the Underwriting Agreement. In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing, and upon originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company and the Guarantors, and have made such other investigations, as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth. Our opinion that the Registration Statement has become effective
 
MORGAN STANLEY & CO. INCORPORATED CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON LLC CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC. -
under the Securities Act is based on oral advice from the staff of the Commission to the effect that the Registration Statement has been declared effective.
               In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
               In rendering the opinions set forth below in paragraphs 2, 4 and 5 below we have assumed that (1) each of the Guarantors that is not organized under the law of the State of Delaware or the law of the State of New York (each, a "Non-DN Guarantor") is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation, limited liability company, general partnership or limited partnership, to the extent those concepts exist in such jurisdiction, under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has duly authorized, executed and delivered each of the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement in accordance with its organizational documents and the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and (2) the execution, delivery and performance by the Non-DN Guarantors of each of the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement does not violate the laws of the jurisdiction in which each of the Non-DN Guarantors is organized.
               Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
     1. Each of the Company and the Guarantors organized in the State of Delaware (each, a "Delaware Guarantor") has been duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation, limited liability company, general partnership or limited partnership, to the extent such concept exists under the law of the State of Delaware and has full power and authority to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus. The Guarantor incorporated in the State of New York (together
 
MORGAN STANLEY & CO. INCORPORATED CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON LLC CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC. -
with the Delaware Guarantors, each, a "DN Guarantor") has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the law of the State of New York and has full corporate power and authority to conduct its business as described in the Prospectus.
     2. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and the DN Guarantors and, assuming that the Indenture (including the Guarantee set forth therein) is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company and the Guarantors, enforceable against the Company and the Guarantors in accordance with its terms.
     3. The Notes have been duly authorized, executed and issued by the Company and, assuming due authentication thereof by the Trustee and upon payment and delivery in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
     4. The Guarantees have been duly authorized, executed and issued by the DN Guarantors and, assuming due authentication of the Notes by the Trustee and upon payment for and delivery of the Notes in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Guarantors enforceable against the Guarantors in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
     5. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and the DN Guarantors.
     6. The statements made in the Prospectus under the caption "Description of the Notes" insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of certain terms of documents referred to therein, constitute accurate summaries of the terms of such documents in all material respects.
     7. The statements made in the Prospectus under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income and Estate Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders" insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects.
     8. The issue and sale of the Notes by the Company, the issue of the Guarantees by the DN Guarantors, the execution, delivery and performance by the Company and the Guarantors of the Underwriting Agreement and the execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Company and the Guarantors (A) will not breach, or result in a default under any of the agreements or instruments identified on Annex II attached hereto, (B) nor will such action violate the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of the DN Guarantors or any federal or New York
 
MORGAN STANLEY & CO. INCORPORATED CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON LLC CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC. -
statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or any rule or regulation that has been issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or any order known to us issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law by any court or governmental agency or body or court having jurisdiction over the Company or the DN Guarantors or any of their respective properties.
     9. No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any federal or New York governmental agency or body or any Delaware governmental agency or body acting pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law or, to our knowledge, any federal or New York court or any Delaware court acting pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law is required for the issue and sale of the Notes by the Company, the issue of the Guarantees by the DN Guarantors and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, except for the registration under the Securities Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Notes by the Underwriters.
     10. The Company is not an "investment company" within the meaning of, nor is it subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     11. To our knowledge, except as disclosed in the Prospectus, there are no pending or threatened actions, suits or proceedings against or affecting the Company or the Guarantors or any of their respective properties or assets that, if determined adversely to the Company or any of the Guarantors, would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Company or any Guarantors to perform their respective obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees.
     12. Neither the sale, issuance, execution or delivery of the Notes will violate Regulation T (assuming that the Underwriters do not sell the Notes to any person or entity subject to Regulation T for such person's or entity's own account), U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
     13. To our knowledge, there are no contracts or agreements between the Company and any person granting such person the right (other than rights which have been waived or satisfied) to require the Company to include any securities of the Company owned or to be owned by such person in the securities registered pursuant to the Registration Statement.
     14. The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act and the Prospectus was filed on March 11, 2004 pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act and, to our knowledge, no stop
 
MORGAN STANLEY & CO. INCORPORATED CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON LLC CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC. -
     order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued or proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission.
               Our opinions set forth in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above are subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
                  We are members of the Bar of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of New York, the federal law of the United States, the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act or the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act.

and
c/o Credit Suisse First Boston LLC Eleven Madison Avenue New York, New York 10010
Ladies and Gentlemen:
           As Vice President, Legal Services of Peabody Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), I have been asked to render this opinion in connection with the purchase by you of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5-7/8% Senior Notes due 2016 (the "Notes"), unconditionally guaranteed by the Company's subsidiaries listed on Annex I hereto (the "Guarantors"), pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated March 12, 2004 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among you, as Underwriters (the "Underwriters"), the Company and the Guarantors.
 
           I have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-109906), filed by the Company and the Guarantors under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as it became effective under the Securities Act; the Company's and the Guarantor's prospectus, dated March 8, 2004, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement, dated March 12, 2004 (the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company and the Guarantor pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act, which pursuant to Form S-3 incorporates by reference or is deemed to incorporate by reference the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 and the Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company filed on March 10, 2004 (collectively, the "Exchange Act Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); the indenture dated as of March 23, 2004 (the "Indenture") among the Company, the Guarantors and US Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee") relating to the Notes and the related guarantees of the Guarantors, the terms of which are set forth in the Indenture (the "Guarantees"); the global notes representing the Notes and the Underwriting Agreement. In addition, I have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing, and upon originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company and the Guarantors, and have made such other investigations, as I have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth.
 
           In such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as duplicates or certified or conformed copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
           Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein, I am of the opinion that:
     1. Each of Grand Eagle Mining, Inc. and Ohio County Coal Company (each, a "Kentucky Guarantor") has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the law of the State of Kentucky and are duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and carry on its business as now being conducted.
     2. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Kentucky Guarantors.
     3. The Guarantees have been duly authorized, executed and issued by the Kentucky Guarantors.
     4. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Kentucky Guarantors.
     5. The execution, delivery and performance by the Kentucky Guarantors of the Underwriting Agreement, the issue of the Guarantees by the Kentucky Guarantors, and the execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Kentucky Guarantors will not violate any Kentucky statute or any rule or regulation that has been issued pursuant to any Kentucky statute or any order known to me issued pursuant to any Kentucky statute by any court or governmental agency or body or court having jurisdiction over the Kentucky Guarantors or any of their respective properties.

Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or the omission or alleged omission: (x) relates to information under the caption "Selling Stockholders" relating to such Selling Stockholder; or (y) was made in conformity with written information concerning such Selling Stockholder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of that Selling Stockholder specifically for inclusion therein; provided, however, that the indemnification contained in this paragraph (b) with respect to the Preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the benefit of the Company or any Underwriter (or to the benefit of any officers or employees of the Company or any Underwriter or of any person controlling the Company or such Underwriter) on account of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arising from the sale of Stock by such Underwriter to any person if the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus and the Underwriter sold Stock to that person without sending or giving at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented) if the Company has previously furnished sufficient copies thereof to the Underwriter on a timely basis to permit such sending or giving. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability which the Selling Stockholders may otherwise have to the Company or any Underwriter or any officer, employee or controlling person of the Company or that Underwriter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the liability of each Selling Stockholder under this Section 10(b) to all such indemnified parties and under Section 2(d) shall not exceed the net amount received by each such Selling Stockholder (after deducting any underwriting discount) from the sale of the Stock pursuant to this Agreement.
          (c) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Selling Stockholders, the Company's officers and employees, each of its directors, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of that Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling
 
person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person.
          (d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 10 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 10, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 10 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 10. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 10 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that the Representatives shall have the right to employ counsel to represent jointly the Representatives and those other Underwriters and their respective officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company or any Selling Stockholder under this Section 10 if, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, it is advisable for the Representatives and those Underwriters, officers, employees and controlling persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company or any Selling Stockholder. No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
 
          (e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 10 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 10(a), 10(b) or 10(c) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Stock or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Stock purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the shares of the Stock purchased under this Agreement, on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the Stock under this Agreement, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Selling Stockholders or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 10 were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 10 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 10(e), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10(e), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Stock underwritten by it and distributed to the public was offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to
 
contribute as provided in this Section 10(e) are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
          (f) The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company acknowledges that the statements with respect to the public offering of the Stock by the Underwriters set forth on the cover page of, the fourth and nineteenth paragraphs appearing under the caption "Underwriting" in, the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
     SECTION 11. If, on either Delivery Date, any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Stock that the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such Delivery Date in the respective proportions that the number of shares of the Firm Stock set opposite the name of each remaining non-defaulting Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto bears to the total number of shares of the Firm Stock set opposite the names of all the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters in Schedule 1 hereto; provided, however, that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any of the Stock on such Delivery Date if the total number of shares of the Stock that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such date exceeds 9.09% of the total number of shares of the Stock to be purchased on such Delivery Date, and any remaining non-defaulting Underwriter shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the number of shares of the Stock that it agreed to purchase on such Delivery Date pursuant to the terms of Section 4. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, in such proportion as may be agreed upon among them, all the Stock to be purchased on such Delivery Date. If the remaining Underwriters or other underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives do not elect to purchase the shares that the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase on such Delivery Date, this Agreement (or, with respect to the Second Delivery Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase, and of the Company and the Selling Stockholders to sell, the Option Stock) shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter, the Company or the Selling Stockholders, except that the Company and the Selling Stockholders will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses to the extent set forth in Sections 8 and 13. As used in this Agreement, the term "" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context requires otherwise, any party not listed in Schedule 1 hereto who, pursuant to this Section 11, purchases Stock that a defaulting Underwriter agreed to, but failed to, purchase.
Defaulting Underwriters.
Underwriter
          Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company or the Selling Stockholders for damages caused by its default. If other underwriters are obligated or agree to purchase the Stock of a defaulting or withdrawing Underwriter, either the Representatives or the Company may
 
postpone the Delivery Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement.
     SECTION 12. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to and received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders prior to delivery of and payment for the Firm Stock if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 9(l), 9(m) or 9(n), shall have occurred or if the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Stock for any reason permitted under this Agreement.
Termination.
     SECTION 13. If the Company or the Selling Stockholders shall fail to tender the Stock for delivery to the Underwriters by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company or such Selling Stockholders to perform any agreement on its part to be performed, or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company or such Selling Stockholders (including, without limitation, with respect to the transactions) is not fulfilled, the Company or such Selling Stockholders will reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Stock, and upon demand the Company and such Selling Stockholders shall pay the full amount thereof to the Representatives. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 11 by reason of the default of one or more Underwriters, the Company and such Selling Stockholders shall not be obligated to reimburse any defaulting Underwriter on account of those expenses.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expense.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, gifts or transfers to (A) the undersigned's immediate family or (B) a trust or partnership the beneficiary and sole partners of which are members of the undersigned's immediate family and/or the undersigned, shall not be prohibited by this agreement if the donee or transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the foregoing in the same manner as it applies to the undersigned.

          As of the date hereof, all of the Company's Subsidiaries, other than the Specified Subsidiaries, are Restricted Subsidiaries. The Board of Directors may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if such designation would not cause a Default. For purposes of making such determination, all outstanding Investments by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid in cash) in the Subsidiary so designated shall be deemed to be Restricted Payments at the time of such designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of this Section 4.07. All such outstanding Investments shall be deemed to constitute Investments in an amount equal to the fair market value of such
 
Investments at the time of such designation. Such designation will only be permitted if such Restricted Payment would be permitted at such time and if such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.
          If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the requirements in the definition of "" as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it shall thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of this Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under Section 4.09 hereof, the Company shall be in default of such covenant). The Board of Directors of the Company may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation shall be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such designation shall only be permitted if (i) such Indebtedness is permitted under Section 4.09 hereof, calculated on a basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the four-quarter reference period, and (ii) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence following such designation.
Unrestricted Subsidiary

          The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment. The fair market value of any noncash Restricted Payment or any adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 4.07 shall be determined by the Board of Directors whose resolution with respect thereto shall be delivered to the Trustee, such determination to be based upon an opinion or appraisal issued by an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing if such fair market value exceeds $25.0 million. Not later than the date of making any Restricted Payment, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that such Restricted Payment is permitted and setting forth the basis upon which the calculations required by this Section 4.07 were computed.
          If any Restricted Investment is sold or otherwise liquidated or repaid or any dividend or payment is received by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary and such amounts may be credited to clause (c) above, then such amounts will be credited only to the extent of amounts not otherwise included in Consolidated Net Income and that do not otherwise increase the amount available as a Permitted Investment.

          (e) a default occurs under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the date of this First Supplemental Indenture, which default results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity and, in each case, the principal amount of such Indebtedness aggregates $50.0 million or more;
          (f) a final judgment or final judgments for the payment of money are entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary and such judgment or judgments remain undischarged for a period (during which execution shall not be effectively stayed) of 60 days, provided that the aggregate of all such undischarged judgments exceeds $50.0 million;

Section 6.02.
Acceleration.
          If any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (g) or (h) of Section 6.01 hereof with respect to the Company, any Significant Subsidiary that is a Restricted Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately; provided, that so long as any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the Credit Agreement shall be outstanding, such acceleration shall not be effective until the earlier of (i) an acceleration of any such Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement or (ii) five Business Days after receipt by the Company of written notice of such acceleration of the Notes. Upon any such declaration, the Notes shall become due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in clause (g) or (h) of Section 6.01 hereof occurs with respect to the Company, any of its Significant Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes shall be due and payable without further action or notice. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of all of the Holders rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default (except nonpayment of principal, interest or premium that has become due solely because of the acceleration) have been cured or waived.
Section 6.03.
Other Remedies.
          If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Notes or this Indenture.
 
          The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
Section 6.04.
Waiver of Past Defaults.
          Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences hereunder, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes; that after any acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration is obtained by the Trustee, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may rescind and annul such acceleration if all Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of accelerated principal, premium, or interest, have been cured or waived as provided in this Indenture. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
provided, however,
Section 6.05.
Control by Majority.
          Subject to Section 6.01 of the Base Indenture, in case an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against any loss, liability or expense. Subject to Section 6.07 of the Base Indenture, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of Notes or that may involve the Trustee in personal liability.
Section 6.06.
Limitation on Suits.
          A Holder of a Note may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Notes only if:
          (a) the Holder of a Note gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default;
 
          (b) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
          (c) such Holder of a Note or Holders of Notes offer and, if requested, provide to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;
          (d) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer and, if requested, the provision of indemnity; and
          (e) during such 60-day period the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.
          (f) A Holder of a Note may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder of a Note or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder of a Note.
Section 6.07.
Rights of Holders of Notes to Receive Payment.
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder of a Note to receive payment of principal, premium and interest on the Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.

custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07 of the Base Indenture. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.07 of the Base Indenture out of the estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
Section 6.10.

Section 6.11.
Undertaking for Costs.
          In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant.

For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 7.05 hereof and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (a) and (b) below, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Notes and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive solely from the trust fund described in Section 7.04 hereof, and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest if any, on such Notes when such payments are due, (b) the Company's obligations with respect to such Notes under Article II and Section 4.02 hereof, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties, liabilities and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and the Company's and the Subsidiary Guarantors' obligations in connection therewith and (d) this Article VII.

For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes, the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 hereof, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Notes shall be unaffected thereby.

Section 8.02.
With Consent of Holders of Notes.
          Except as provided below in this Section 8.02, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement this First Supplemental Indenture (including Sections 3.09, 4.10 and 4.15 hereof), the Subsidiary Guarantees and the Notes may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes, including Additional Notes, if any, then outstanding voting as a single class (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes), and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, any existing Default or Event of Default (except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest, premium, or the principal of, the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes, including Additional Notes, if any, then outstanding voting as a single class (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes). Section 2.06 hereof shall determine which Notes are considered to be "outstanding" for purposes of this Section 8.02.
          Upon the request of the Company accompanied by a Board Resolution of the Board of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 6.03 of the Base Indenture, the Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture unless such amended or supplemental Indenture directly affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture.
          The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Persons entitled to consent to any indenture supplemental hereto. If a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such supplemental indenture, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; , that unless such consent shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having been obtained prior to the date which is 90 days after such record date, any such consent previously given shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be cancelled and of no further effect.
provided
          It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 8.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
 
          After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders to such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental Indenture or waiver. Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, including Additional Notes, if any, then outstanding voting as a single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Company with any provision of this Indenture or the Notes. Without the consent of each Holder, an amendment or waiver under this Section 8.02 may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):
          (a) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
          (b) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes except as provided above with respect to Sections 3.09, 4.10 and 4.15 hereof;
          (c) make any change in the provisions of Sections 4.10 or 4.15;
          (d) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;
          (e) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest or premium on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
          (f) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;
          (g) make any change in the provisions of this Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest or premium on the Notes;
          (h) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by Section 4.10 or 4.15 hereof);
          (i) release any Subsidiary Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee or this Indenture, except in accordance with the terms hereof; or
          (j) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.
 
Section 8.03.
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.
          Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes shall be set forth in an amended or supplemental Indenture that complies with the TIA as then in effect.
Section 8.04.
Revocation and Effect of Consents.
          Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.
Section 8.05.
Notation on or Exchange of Notes.
          The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Company in exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt of an Authentication Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver.
          Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
Section 8.06.
Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.
          The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized pursuant to this Article VIII if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Company may not sign an amendment or supplemental Indenture until the Board of Directors approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 6.01 of the Base Indenture) shall be fully protected in relying upon an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and that such amended or supplemental indenture is the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to customary exceptions and that such amended or supplemental indenture complies with the provisions hereof (including Section 8.03).
 
Section 9.01.
Guarantee.
          Subject to this Article IX, each of the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that: (a) the principal of and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal of and interest on the Notes, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, that same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed or any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Subsidiary Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
          Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations with regard to this Subsidiary Guarantee shall be joint and several, unconditional, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of the Notes or the obligations of the Company under this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, the recovery of any judgment against the Company or any other obligor with respect to this Indenture, the Notes or the Obligations of the Company under this Indenture or the Notes, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstances (other than complete performance) which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a Subsidiary Guarantor. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further, to the extent permitted by law, waives and relinquishes all claims, rights and remedies accorded by applicable law to guarantors and agrees not to assert or take advantage of any such claims, rights or remedies, including but not limited to: (a) any right to require any of the Trustee, the Holders or the Company (each a ""), as a condition of payment or performance by such Subsidiary Guarantor, to (1) proceed against the Company, any other guarantor (including any other Subsidiary Guarantor) of the Obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantees or any other Person, (2) proceed against or exhaust any security held from the Company, any such other guarantor or any other Person, (3) proceed against or have resort to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of any Benefited Party in favor of the Company or any other Person, or (4) pursue any other remedy in the power of any Benefited Party whatsoever; (b) any defense arising by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense of the Company including any defense based on or arising out of the lack of validity or the unenforceability of the
Benefited Party
 
Obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantees or any agreement or instrument relating thereto or by reason of the cessation of the liability of the Company from any cause other than payment in full of the Obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantees; (c) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal; (d) any defense based upon any Benefited Party's errors or omissions in the administration of the Obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantees, except behavior which amounts to bad faith; (e)(1) any principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, which are or might be in conflict with the terms of the Subsidiary Guarantees and any legal or equitable discharge of such Subsidiary Guarantor's obligations hereunder, (2) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Subsidiary Guarantor's liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof, (3) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and counterclaims and (4) promptness, diligence and any requirement that any Benefited Party protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any property subject thereto; (f) notices, demands, presentations, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and notices of any action or inaction, including acceptance of the Subsidiary Guarantees, notices of default under the Notes or any agreement or instrument related thereto, notices of any renewal, extension or modification of the Obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantees or any agreement related thereto, and notices of any extension of credit to the Company and any right to consent to any thereof; (g) to the extent permitted under applicable law, the benefits of any "One Action" rule and (h) any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, or which may conflict with the terms of the Subsidiary Guarantees. Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby covenants that its Subsidiary Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in its Subsidiary Guarantee and this Indenture.
          If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to either the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors, any amount paid by either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Subsidiary Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
          Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Subsidiary Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Section 6.02 hereof for the purposes of this Subsidiary Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Section 6.02 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Subsidiary Guarantors for the purpose of this Subsidiary Guarantee. The Subsidiary Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any
 
non-paying Subsidiary Guarantor so long as the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Subsidiary Guarantee.
Section 9.02.
Limitation on Subsidiary Guarantor Liability.
          Each Subsidiary Guarantor, and by its acceptance of Notes, each Holder, hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any Subsidiary Guarantee. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Trustee, the Holders and the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee and this Article IX shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Subsidiary Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Subsidiary Guarantor under this Article IX, result in the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.
Section 9.03.
Execution and Delivery of Subsidiary Guarantee.
          To evidence its Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 9.01, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee substantially in the form included in Exhibit B shall be endorsed by an Officer of such Subsidiary Guarantor on each Note authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and that this Indenture shall be executed on behalf of such Subsidiary Guarantor by its President or one of its Vice Presidents.
          Each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby agrees that its Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in Section 9.01 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to endorse on each Note a notation of such Subsidiary Guarantee.
          If an Officer whose signature is on this Indenture or on the Subsidiary Guarantee no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Note on which a Subsidiary Guarantee is endorsed, the Subsidiary Guarantee shall be valid nevertheless.
          The delivery of any Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of the Subsidiary Guarantee set forth in this Indenture on behalf of the Subsidiary Guarantors.
          In the event that the Company creates or acquires any new Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this First Supplemental Indenture, if required by Section 4.16 hereof, the Company shall cause such Subsidiaries to execute supplemental Indentures to

          (a) subject to Section 9.05 hereof, the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than a Subsidiary Guarantor or the Company) unconditionally assumes all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor, pursuant to a supplemental Indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, under the Notes, this Indenture and the Subsidiary Guarantee on the terms set forth herein or therein;
          (b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Subsidiary Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee. All the Subsidiary Guarantees so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Subsidiary Guarantees theretofore and thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Subsidiary Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
          Except as set forth in Articles IV and V hereof, and notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent any consolidation or merger of a Subsidiary Guarantor with or into the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor, or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of a Subsidiary Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor.

Upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such sale or other disposition was made by the Company in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture, including without limitation Section 4.10 hereof, the Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably required in order to evidence the release of any Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee.
provided
          Any Subsidiary Guarantor not released from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee shall remain liable for the full amount of principal of and interest on the Notes and for the other obligations of any Subsidiary Guarantor under this Indenture as provided in this Article IX.
