The effective date of the lease is September 1, 2004 with a minimum term of 20 years and for so long thereafter as coal is produced in commercial quantities from the leased land. Peabody made an initial bonus payment of $54.8 million and is obligated to make deferred bonus payments of $54.8 million to the BLM on each of the first four anniversary dates of the lease. The lease also requires the payment of customary production royalties as coal is extracted.
