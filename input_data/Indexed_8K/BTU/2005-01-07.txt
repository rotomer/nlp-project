This summary is not intended to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this report and the form of Performance Units Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this report. Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement The options granted on January 3, 2005 have an exercise price of $77.31 per share and will vest over a three-year period in equal annual installments. The options will become fully exercisable upon the termination of the optionees employment with the Company on account of the opti onees death or disability (as defined in the Plan), a change of control (as defined in the Plan) or a recapitalization event (as defined in the Plan) and the vested portion of the options may be exercised by the optionee, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the earliest to occur of:  the tenth anniversary of the date of grant;  the first anniversary of the termination of the optionees employment with the Company by reason of death or disability (as defined in the Plan) or without cause (as defined in the Plan) or for good reason (as defined in the Plan);  the fifth anniversary of the date of the termination of the optionees employment with the Company by reason of retirement (as defined in the Plan);  the date of the termination of the optionees employment with the Company for cause (as defined in the Plan) or without good reason (as defined in the Plan); or  the date of the termination of the optionees e mployment with the Company for any reason if the exercise price is higher than the fair market value of a share of common stock on such date. Upon a change of control (as defined in the Plan), the Committee may terminate the option, so long as the optionee is cashed out at the change of control price or is permitted to exercise his or her option prior to such change of control. Performance Units Agreement The performance units granted on January 3, 2005 vest on the 15th day of each calendar month, in equal monthly increments, starting on the date of grant and ending on December 31, 2007. The amount of common stock payable to the grantee pursuant to the performance units will be determined on the earliest to occur of the following (the "Determination Date"):  December 31, 2007;  a termination of the grantees employment with the Company on account of death, disability (as defined in the Plan) or retirement (as defined in the Plan);  a terminati on of the grantees employment with the Company by the Company without cause (as defined in the Plan);  a termination of the grantees employement with the Company by the grantee for good reason (as defined in the Plan);  a change of control (as defined in the Plan); or  a recapitalization event (as defined in the Plan).

The amount of shares of common stock payable to the grantee under the performance units will equal the sum of:  50% times the number of performance units that are vested as of the Determination Date, multiplied by the FMV per S hare as of the Determination Date, and further multiplied by a percentage ranging from 0% to 200%, depending upon the achievement of specified EBITDA ROIC Targets; plus  50% times the number of performance units that are vested as of the Determination Date, multiplied by the FMV per Share as of the Determination Date, and further multiplied by a percentage ranging from 0% to 200%, depending upon the achievement of specified goals for the Companys average total shareholder return, as compared to both an industry peer group and the Standard & Poor 400 Mid Cap Index). ------------------------- (1) Actual number of performance shares cannot be calculated at this time. The number of performance shares will be based on the dollar amount as reflected in the table, divided by the average closing share price of Peabody Energy Corporation Common Stock for the period January 3, 2005 to January 28, 2005.
