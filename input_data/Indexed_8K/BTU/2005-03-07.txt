Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
Effective March 1, 2005, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Peabody Energy Corporation ("Peabody") and the United States Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") entered into a coal lease agreement on approximately 2,300 acres of land, including approximately 324 million tons of high Btu, low sulfur coal reserves in the Powder River Basin. The lease has a minimum term of 20 years and for so long thereafter as coal is produced in commercial quantities from the leased lands, subject to readjustment of lease terms at the end of the 20th lease year and each 10-year period thereafter. Peabody is obligated to make five deferred bonus payments of $59.8 million. The first payment was made on the date the bid was awarded by the BLM; successive payments are due each year on March 1 for four years beginning in 2006. The total, undiscounted deferred bonus obligation is $299.1 million ($59.8 million of which has been paid). Production royalties required under the lease will be 12 1/2% of the value of the coal produced.
A copy of the coal lease agreement will be filed as an exhibit to Peabody's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.
