FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PEABODY ENERGY UPDATES PRODUCTION AND FINANCIAL OUTLOOK
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 6 Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) announced today that it now targets 2006 production of approximately 230 million tons, an increase of 7 percent over prior-year levels. The production target is at the low end of the original range of 230 to 240 million tons, and reflects 4 to 5 million tons of lower third-quarter shipments. The company expects record 2006 coal sales of 250 to 260 million tons, within 2 percent of targets at the beginning of the year.

Regarding the company's outlook for the third quarter, management reaffirms earnings per share solidly within the original targeted range of $0.35 to $0.55. With the revised production range, the company targets third quarter EBITDA near the low end of management's beginning-of-quarter target of $250 to $300 million.
"Peabody's management is keenly focused on solving these near-term supplier and transportation issues," said Peabody President and Chief Executive Officer Gregory H. Boyce. "Overall, Peabody is performing very well. Long-term industry fundamentals are strengthening, and we look forward to record performance for 2006, 2007 and beyond."
The lower-than-targeted production primarily relates to new equipment problems, transportation shortfalls and the early closing of a third-party coal supplier. These issues include:
