     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, on the one hand, and the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the Securities purchased under this Agreement, on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the Securities under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8 were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 8 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 8(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably
 
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by it was resold to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to their respective Purchase obligations and not joint.
     (e) The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors acknowledge that the names of the Underwriters set forth on the cover page of, and the names of the underwriters appearing in the table on page S-50, the second full paragraph after such table, the second sentence of the third full paragraph following such table, the fourth full paragraph following such table, the four bullet points following such fourth full paragraph, and the first full paragraph on page S-51 in, the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
     SECTION 9. .
Defaulting Underwriters
     If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such Closing Date; that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any of the Notes on such Closing Date if the total amount of the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such date exceeds 9.09% of the total amount of Notes to be purchased on such Closing Date, and the non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the amount of Notes which they agreed to purchase on such Closing Date pursuant to the terms of Section 3. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other Underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, all of the Notes to be purchased on such Closing Date. If the non-defaulting Underwriters do not elect to purchase the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such Closing Date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses to the extent set forth in Sections 6 and 11. As used in this Agreement, the term "" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context requires otherwise, any party not listed in Schedule II hereto who, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases the Notes which a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
provided, however,
Underwriter
     Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors for damages caused by its default. If the non-defaulting Underwriter is obligated or agrees to purchase the Notes of the defaulting or withdrawing Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company may postpone
 
the Closing Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Prospectus, in the Time of Sale Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement.
     SECTION 10. . The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to and received by the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Notes if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 7(m), 7(n) and 7(o) shall have occurred or if the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Notes for any reason permitted under this Agreement.
Termination
     SECTION 11. . If the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall fail to deliver the Securities to the Underwriters by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors to perform any agreement on its part to be performed, or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors is not fulfilled, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Securities, and upon demand the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall pay the full amount thereof to the Representatives.
