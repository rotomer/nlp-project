Item 8.01. Other Events.
On October 25, 2006, Peabody Energy Corporation ("Peabody") completed the acquisition of Excel Coal Limited, an independent coal company in Australia. Peabody funded the acquisition with net proceeds from its registered offering of senior notes and borrowings under its senior unsecured credit facility. On December 14, 2006, Peabody priced an offering of $675,000,000 aggregate principal amount of convertible junior subordinated debentures (the "Debentures"). The net proceeds of this offering will be used to refinance certain borrowings under Peabody's senior unsecured credit facility. In addition, Peabody granted the underwriters the right to purchase up to an additional $75,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Debentures solely to cover overallotments.
Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements
The following unaudited pro forma combined financial statements give effect to Peabody's acquisition of Excel completed on October 25, 2006, the related acquisition financings and the refinancing of borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility through the issuance of convertible junior subordinated debentures. The unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2006 is presented as if the acquisition and the related financings had occurred on that date. The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and for the year ended December 31, 2005 assume that the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each respective fiscal year. The acquisition and the related financings are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, with the purchase price allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values, pending the completion of independent appraisals.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with (i) Peabody's historical audited financial statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, (ii) our historical unaudited financial statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" filed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and (iii) the historical audited financial statements of Excel, previously included in a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on October 2, 2006.
The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the financial position that would have been obtained or the results of operations that would have occurred if the acquisition and the related financings had been consummated on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of our financial position or results of operations in the future. The pro forma adjustments, as described in the Notes to Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements, are based upon available information and upon assumptions that Peabody's management believes are reasonable. The actual amounts that Peabody records based on its final assessment of fair values may differ materially from the information presented in these unaudited pro forma combined financial statements.
Due to differing fiscal years between Peabody, which ends its fiscal year on December 31, and Excel, which ends its fiscal year on June 30, calculations were necessary to conform Excel's financial information to the time periods presented.
Information related to Excel included in the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2006 was translated from A$ to US$ using a foreign exchange rate of A$1.00=US$0.7480, based on the closing rate on September 29, 2006. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 was translated from A$ to US$ using an exchange rate of A$1.00=US$0.7480, based on the average closing rates for the period from January 3, 2006 through September 29, 2006. The unaudited pro forma combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 was translated from A$ to US$ using an exchange rate of A$1.00=US$0.7622, based on the average closing rates for the period from January 4, 2005 through December 30, 2005. Asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization were translated from A$ to US$ using a historical exchange rate equal to the opening rate on January 4, 2005 of A$1.00=US$0.7790 for all periods presented.
