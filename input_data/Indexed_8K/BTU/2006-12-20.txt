In connection with the issuance of the Debentures, the Company entered into a Subordinated Indenture, dated December 20, 2006 (the "Subordinated Indenture"), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture, dated December 20, 2006 (the "First Supplemental Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee.
     The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement, the Subordinated Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture is qualified by reference to the agreements, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1, Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 4.2, respectively, and incorporated by reference herein. Further information concerning the Debentures and related matters is set forth in the Company's Prospectus Supplement dated December 14, 2006, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 15, 2006 (the "Prospectus Supplement").
Item 3.03. Material Modifications to Rights of Security Holders.
      In connection with the issuance of the Debentures, the Company has agreed that on any date on which accrued interest on the Debentures through the most recent interest payment date has not been paid in full (including during any optional or mandatory deferral period) and until such time as all accrued but unpaid interest, together with any compounded interest thereon, is paid in full, it will not, and will not permit any "controlled subsidiary" (any corporation in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting stock) to:
 -     declare or pay any dividends on, make distributions regarding, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any shares of capital stock of the Company, other than:
      (1) purchases of the Company's capital stock in connection with employee or agent benefit plans or under any dividend reinvestment plan;
      (2) purchases or repurchases of shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the deferral period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan;
      (3) in connection with the reclassification of any class or series of the Company's capital stock, or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's capital stock for or into another class or series of the Company's capital stock, in each case if the resulting capital stock ranks equal to or junior to the capital stock so reclassified, exchanged or converted;
      (4) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock in connection with the conversion or exchange provisions of that capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged;
      (5) dividends or distributions in the form of the Company's capital stock or rights to acquire the Company's capital stock, where the dividend stock or stock underlying the dividend rights is the same class as the stock on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equal to or junior to such stock;
      (6) any declaration of a dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholders' rights plan, or issuances of capital stock under any such plan in the future, or redemptions or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder' rights plan;
      (7) acquisitions of the Company's capital stock previously issued in connection with acquisitions of businesses made by the Company (which acquisitions are made by the Company in connection with the satisfaction of indemnification obligations of the sellers of such businesses); or
      (8) the payment of any dividend during an optional or mandatory deferral period within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof, if at the date of declaration no optional deferral was in effect and no mandatory trigger event had occurred.
      Further information concerning the foregoing description is set forth in the Prospectus Supplement.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
     In connection with the issuance of the Debentures, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP rendered an opinion regarding certain tax matters. A copy of that opinion is attached hereto as Exhibit 8.1.
     Also in connection with the issuance of the Debentures, the Company entered into a Capital Replacement Covenant (the "CRC"). Pursuant to the CRC, the Company covenanted for the benefit of holders of the Company's 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026, issued in the aggregate principal amount of $250,000,000, that neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall repay, redeem or repurchase all or any part of the Debentures on or after December 15, 2041 and prior to December 15, 2046, except to the extent that the total repayment, redemption or repurchase price does not exceed the sum of: (a) 400% of the Company's net cash proceeds from the sale of its common stock and rights to acquire its common stock (including common stock issued pursuant to the Company's dividend reinvestment plan or employee benefit plans); (b) the Company's net cash proceeds from the sale of its mandatorily convertible preferred stock (as defined in Exhibit 99.1) or debt exchangeable for equity (as defined in Exhibit 99.1); and (c) the Company's net cash proceeds from the sale of other replacement capital securities (as defined in Exhibit 99.1) in each case, during the six months prior to the notice date for the relevant payment, redemption or repurchase.

     (b) Each Underwriter shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such director, officer or
 
controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representatives by or on behalf of that Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that the Representatives shall have the right to employ one counsel to represent jointly the Underwriters and their respective directors, officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company under this Section 8 if, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, it is advisable for the Underwriters, directors, officers, employees and controlling persons to be jointly represented by such counsel, and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if indemnity may be
 
sought pursuant to Section 8(a) hereof in respect of such action or proceeding, then in addition to such separate firm for the indemnified parties, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of not more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for Morgan Stanley in its capacity as a "qualified independent underwriter" and all persons, if any, who control Morgan Stanley within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act. No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include any findings of fact or admissions of fault or culpability as to the indemnified party or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Debentures or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Debentures purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, on the one hand, and the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the Debentures purchased under this Agreement, on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the Debentures under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8 were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or
 
action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 8 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 8(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Debentures purchased by it was resold to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to their respective Purchase obligations and not joint.
     (e) The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company acknowledges that the names of the Underwriters set forth on the cover page of, and the names of the underwriters appearing in the table on page S-105, the third full paragraph after such table, the second sentence of the second full paragraph on page S-106, the fourth full paragraph on page S-106, the four bullet points following such fourth full paragraph, and the fifth full paragraph on page S-106 in, the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
     SECTION 9. .
Defaulting Underwriters
     If, on any Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Debentures that the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such Closing Date; that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any of the Debentures on such Closing Date if the total amount of the Debentures which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such date exceeds 9.09% of the total amount of Debentures to be purchased on such Closing Date, and the non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the amount of Debentures which they agreed to purchase on such Closing Date pursuant to the terms of Section 3. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other Underwriters satisfactory to the Representatives who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, all of the Debentures to be purchased on such Closing Date. If the non-defaulting Underwriters do not elect to purchase the Debentures which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such Closing Date, this Agreement (or, with respect to the Second Closing Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase, and of the Company to sell, the Option Debentures) shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses to the extent set forth in Sections 6 and 11.

Underwriter
 
     Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company for damages caused by its default. If the non-defaulting Underwriter is obligated or agrees to purchase the Debentures of the defaulting or withdrawing Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Prospectus, in the Time of Sale Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement.
     SECTION 10. . The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to and received by the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Debentures if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 7(n), 7(o) and 7(p) shall have occurred or if the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Debentures for any reason permitted under this Agreement.
Termination
     SECTION 11. . If the Company shall fail to deliver the Debentures to the Underwriters by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company to perform any agreement on its part to be performed, or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company is not fulfilled, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Debentures, and upon demand the Company shall pay the full amount thereof to the Representatives.

c/o Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated 1585 Broadway New York, New York 10036 Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as counsel to Peabody Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the purchase by you of $675,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.75% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (the "Debentures"), pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated December 14, 2006 (the "Underwriting Agreement") among you, as underwriters (the "Underwriters") and the Company. The Debentures will be convertible, subject to certain conditions set forth in the subordinated indenture dated as of December 20, 2006 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of December 20, 2006 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee, prior to maturity (unless previously redeemed) into cash or shares (the "Underlying Securities") of (i) perpetual preferred stock of the Company (the "Perpetual Preferred Stock") and, under certain circumstances, (ii) common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock") in accordance with the terms of the Debentures and the Indenture.
     We have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-136108) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as it became effective under the Securities Act; Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement filed by the Company under the Securities Act, as it became effective under the Securities Act; the Company's prospectus dated July 28, 2006, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated December 14, 2006 (the "Base Prospectus"), as supplemented by the preliminary prospectus supplement, dated December 13, 2006 (together with the Base Prospectus and Exhibit B to the Underwriting Agreement, the "Time of Sale Prospectus"), and as supplemented by the prospectus supplement, dated December 14, 2006 (together with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act, which pursuant to Form S-3 incorporates by reference or is deemed to incorporate by reference the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the
 
quarters ended March 31, 2006, June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006 and the Company's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on January 25, 2006, July 7, 2006, September 7, 2006, September 18, 2006, September 19, 2006, October 2, 2006 (as amended by the 8-K/A filed with the SEC on November 13, 2006), October 5, 2006, October 6, 2006, October 11, 2006, October 13, 2006, October 30, 2006 and December 13, 2006 (collectively, the "Exchange Act Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; the Indenture; the global debentures representing the Debentures; a specimen certificate representing the Common Stock; the Certificate of Designations of Perpetual Preferred Stock, dated December [ ], 2006; and the Underwriting Agreement. In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing and upon originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company and have made such other investigations, as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth.
     In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
     Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
     1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the law of the State of Delaware and has full corporate power and authority to conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
     2. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming that the Indenture is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee, the Indenture constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
     3. The Debentures have been duly authorized, executed and issued by the Company and, assuming due authentication thereof by the Trustee and upon payment and delivery in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
     4. The shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Indenture upon conversion of the Debentures have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance by the Company and, when issued and delivered in accordance with the Indenture and the Debentures, will be validly issued, fully paid and non assessable.
     5. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
     6. The statements made in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Convertible Debentures," "Description of the Perpetual Preferred Stock" and "Description of Capital Stock," insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of certain terms of documents referred to therein, constitute accurate summaries of the terms of such documents in all material respects.
     7. The statements made in the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income and Estate Tax Considerations," insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects.
     8. The issue and sale of the Debentures by the Company, the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the execution and delivery of the Indenture by the Company will not breach or result in a default under any agreement or instrument filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, nor will such action violate the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws or other organizational documents of the Company or any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or any rule or regulation that has been issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or any order known to us issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law by any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties.
     9. No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any federal or New York governmental agency or body or any Delaware governmental agency or body acting pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law or, to our knowledge, any federal or New York court or any Delaware court acting pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law is required for the issue and sale of the Debentures by the Company, the issuance of the Underlying Securities initially issuable by the Company upon conversion of the Debentures in accordance with the terms of the Debentures and the Indenture and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, except for the registration under the Securities Act of the Debentures and the Underlying Securities and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Debentures by the Underwriters.
     10. The Company is not an "investment company" within the meaning of and, subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
     11. To our knowledge, there are no statutes or pending or threatened legal or governmental proceedings required to be described in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus which are not described as required, or any contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or incorporated by reference therein that are not described and filed or incorporated by reference as required.
 
     12. The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act and the Prospectus was filed on [], 2006 pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued or proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission.
                    
     Our opinions set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 above are subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

     SECTION 3.03. . At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication. Except as otherwise provided in this Article Three, the Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver said Securities to or upon a Company Order, signed by two Officers of the Company by manual or facsimile signature. In authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall receive, and (subject to Section 6.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon:
Authentication and Dating
     (1) a copy of any Board Resolution relating thereto and, if applicable, an appropriate record of any action taken pursuant to such resolution, in each case certified by the Secretary or an Assistant secretary of the Company;
     (2) an executed supplemental indenture, if any;

     (a) that the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or by a supplemental indenture as permitted by Section 2.01 in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;

     The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Securities under this Section if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not
 
15
lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing Holders.
     Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
     Reference is made to Section 15.05 concerning execution and delivery of the Guarantees.
     SECTION 3.04. . The Securities shall be signed in the name and on behalf of the Company by the manual or facsimile signatures of two Officers of the Company (which may be printed, engraved or otherwise reproduced thereon, by facsimile or otherwise). Only such Securities as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form hereinbefore recited, executed by the Trustee, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. Such certificate by the Trustee upon any Security executed by the Company shall be conclusive evidence that the Security so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the Holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Execution of Securities
     In case any Officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Securities shall cease to be such officer before the Securities so signed shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, or disposed of by the Company, such Securities nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the person who signed such Securities had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Security may be signed on behalf of the Company by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Security, shall be the proper officers of the Company, although at the date of the execution of this Indenture any such person was not such an officer.
     Reference is made to Section 15.05 concerning execution and delivery of the Guarantees.
     SECTION 3.05. . Securities of any series may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of the same series of other authorized denominations. Securities to be exchanged shall be surrendered at the office or agency to be maintained by the Company, as provided in Section 10.02. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of the registration of Securities and of transfer of Securities in the Security Register as herein provided. The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register for each series of Securities issued hereunder (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations at it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and the transfer of Securities as in this Article Three provided. The Security Register shall be in written form or in any other form capable of being converted into written form within a reasonable time. Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at such office or agency, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall register, authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Security or Securities of the same series for an equal aggregate principal amount.
Exchange and Registration of Transfer of Securities
     All Securities presented for registration of transfer or for exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so required by the Company or the Security Registrar) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the
 
16
Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the registered Holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.
     The Company shall not be required to exchange or register the transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for a period of 15 days preceding the first mailing or publication of notice of redemption of Securities of such series to be redeemed, or (b) any Securities selected, called or being called for redemption except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
     SECTION 3.06. . In case any temporary or definitive Security shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company in the case of a mutilated Security shall, and in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Security may in its discretion, execute, and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Security of the same series bearing a number, letter or other distinguishing symbol not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Security, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen, or if any such Security shall have matured or shall be about to mature, instead of issuing a substituted Security, the Company may pay or authorize the payment of the same without surrender thereof (except in the case of a mutilated Security). In every case the applicant for a substituted Security shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and to the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Securities
     The Trustee may authenticate any such substituted Security and deliver the same upon the written request or authorization of any Officer of the Company. Upon the issuance of any substituted Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected therewith and in addition a further sum not exceeding two dollars for each Security so issued in substitution.
     Every substituted Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.06 by virtue of the fact that any Security is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be found at any time, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) any and all other rights or remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
     SECTION 3.07. . Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series the Company may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary
Temporary Securities
 
17
Securities (printed or lithographed). Temporary Securities shall be issuable in any authorized denomination and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Company. Every such temporary Security shall be executed by the Company and shall be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the definitive Securities. Without unreasonable delay the Company will execute and deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities of such series and thereupon any or all temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefore, at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities. Such exchange shall be made by the Company at its own expense and without any charge therefor except that in case of any such exchange involving any registration of transfer the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities authenticated and delivered hereunder.
     If the Company shall establish pursuant to Section 3.01 that the Securities of a series are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more Global Securities, then the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with Section 3.03 and the Company Order with respect to such series, authenticate and deliver one or more Global Securities in temporary or permanent form that (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series to be represented by one or more Global Securities, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the U.S. Depositary for such Global Security or Securities or the nominee of such depositary, and (iii) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "This Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary, unless and until this Security is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form" and such other legend as may be required by the U.S. Depositary.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section or Section 3.05, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the U.S. Depositary for such series to a nominee of such depositary or by a nominee of such depositary to such depositary or another nominee of such depositary or by such depositary or any such nominee to a successor U.S. Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor depositary.
     If at any time the U.S. Depositary for the Securities of a series notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as U.S. Depositary for the Securities of such series or if at any time the U.S. Depositary for Securities of a series shall no longer be a clearing agency registered and in good standing under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor U.S. Depositary with respect to the Securities of such series. If a successor U.S. Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or
 
18
becomes aware of such condition, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
     The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
     If the Securities of any series shall have been issued in the form of one or more Global Securities and if an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company will promptly execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in definitive form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
     If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 3.01 with respect to Securities of a series, the U.S. Depositary for such series of Securities may surrender a Global Security for such series of Securities in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of such series in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such depositary. Thereupon, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without charge:
     (1) to each Person specified by the U.S. Depositary a new Registered Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and
     (2) to the U.S. Depositary a new Global Security in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities delivered to Holders thereof.
     Upon the exchange of a Global Security in whole for Securities in definitive form, such Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Securities so issued in exchange for a Global Security shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the U.S. Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
     SECTION 3.08. . Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved
 
19
be paid to the Person in whose name that Security is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
     Any interest on any Security which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date or within 30 days thereafter (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder; and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
     (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder at his address as it appears in the Security Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. The Trustee may, in its discretion, in the name and at the expense of the Company, cause a similar notice to be published at least once in a newspaper, customarily published in the English language on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, but such publication shall not be a condition precedent to the establishment of such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities are registered on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
     (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
     Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall
 
20
carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
     SECTION 3.09. . Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, the Authenticating Agent and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name the Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of, and (subject to Section 3.08) interest on, such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee, the Authenticating Agent nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Persons Deemed Owners
     SECTION 3.10. . All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee, and any such Securities and Securities surrendered directly to the Trustee for any such purpose shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in its customary manner.
Cancellation
     SECTION 3.11. . Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of any Series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
Computation of Interest
     SECTION 3.12. . The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.
CUSIP Numbers
provided
     SECTION 4.01. . This Indenture shall cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when:

     SECTION 5.03. .
Payment of Securities on Default; Suit Therefor
     The Company covenants that (a) in case default shall be made in the payment of any installment of interest upon any of the Securities of any series as and when the same shall become due and payable, and such default shall have continued for a period of 30 days, or (b) in case default shall be made in the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, on any of the Securities of any series as and when the same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity of the Securities of that series or upon redemption or by declaration, repayment or otherwise, then, upon demand of the Trustee, the Company will pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of that series, the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable on all such Securities of that series for principal and premium, if any, or interest, or both,
 
25

     In case the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any actions or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities wherever situated the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable.
     In case there shall be pending proceedings for the bankruptcy or for the reorganization of the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of any series under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, or in case a receiver or trustee shall have been appointed for the property of the Company or such other obligor, or in the case of any other similar judicial proceedings relative to the Company or other obligor upon the Securities of any series, or to the creditors or property of the Company or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities of any series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.03 shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise, to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any) and interest (or, if the Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities of any series and, in case of any judicial proceedings, to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceedings relative to the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of any series, its or their creditors, or its or their property, and to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute the same after the deduction of its charges and expenses; and any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization is hereby authorized by each of the Holders to make such payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for compensation and expenses, including counsel fees and expenses incurred by it up to the date of such distribution. To the extent that such payment of reasonable compensation, expenses and counsel fees and expenses out of the estate in any such proceedings shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, moneys, securities and other property which the Holders of the Securities of any series may be entitled to receive in such proceedings, whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.
 
26
     All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the Securities, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities, or the production thereof on any trial or other proceeding relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of all the Securities in respect of which such action was taken.
     SECTION 5.04. . Any moneys collected by the Trustee under this Article Five shall be applied in the order following, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee for the distribution of such moneys, upon presentation of the several Securities in respect of which moneys have been collected, and stamping thereon the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
Application of Moneys Collected by Trustee
      To the payment of costs and expenses of collection and reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and of all other expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee except as a result of its negligence or bad faith;
First:
     : To holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and, if such money or property has been collected from a Guarantor, to holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor, in each case to the extent required by Article Fourteen and/or Article Sixteen hereof, as applicable;
Second

Third:
      In case the principal of the Outstanding Securities in respect of which such moneys have been collected shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, to the payment of the whole amount then owing and unpaid upon the Securities of that series for principal and premium, if any, and interest, with interest on the overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon overdue installments of interest at the rate or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) borne by the Securities of that series; and in case such moneys shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amounts so due and unpaid upon the Securities of that series, then to the payment of such principal and premium, if any, and interest without preference or priority of principal and premium, if any, over interest, or of interest over principal and premium, if any, or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Security of that series over any other Security of that series, ratably to the aggregate of such principal and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest; and

27
     : Any surplus then remaining shall be paid to the Company, its successors or assigns, or to whomsoever may be entitled to receive the same.
Fifth
     SECTION 5.05. . No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right by virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of default and of the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided, and unless also the Holders of not less than 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as Trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding and during such 60-day period, no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding (or such amount as shall have acted at a meeting pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture), it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker and Holder of every Security with every other taker and Holder and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holder, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such Holder, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all such Holders.
Proceedings by Holders
     Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Indenture, however, the right of any Holder of any Security to receive payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on such Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates shall not be impaired or affected without the written consent of such Holder.
     SECTION 5.06. . In case of an Event of Default hereunder the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem necessary to protect and enforce any of such rights, either by suit in equity or by action at law or by proceeding in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law.
Proceedings by Trustee
     SECTION 5.07. . All powers and remedies given by this Article Five to the Trustee or to the Holders shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any thereof or of any other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the Holders, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture, and no delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power, or shall
Remedies Cumulative and Continuing
 
28
be construed to be a waiver of any such default or an acquiescence therein; and, subject to the provisions of Section 5.05, every power and remedy given by this Article Five or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders.
     SECTION 5.08. . The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding shall have the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series; that (subject to the provisions of Section 6.01) the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that the action or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that the action or proceedings so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Subject to Section 5.02, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series at the time Outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities of that series waive any past default or Event of Default described in Section 5.01, or any other Event of Default for such series specified in the terms thereof as contemplated by Section 3.01, and its consequences except a default in the payment of interest, or premium, if any, on, or the principal of any of the Securities or a default which, under Section 9.02, cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each Holder of each Security affected by such waiver. Upon any such waiver the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities of that series shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any default or Event of Default hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by this Section 5.08, said default or Event of Default shall for all purposes of the Securities of that series and this Indenture be deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing.
Direction of Proceedings and Waiver of Defaults by Majority of Holders
provided, however,
     SECTION 5.09. . All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section 5.09 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder of the Securities of any series or group of such Holders, holding in the aggregate more than ten percent in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Security against the Company on or after the due date expressed in such Security.

however
     Nothing herein contained, however, shall affect the right of the Trustee:
     (A) to retain for its own account (i) payments made on account of any such claim by any Person (other than the Company) who is liable thereon, and (ii) the proceeds of the bona fide sale of any such claim by the Trustee to a third Person, and (iii) distributions made in cash, securities or other property in respect of claims filed against the Company in bankruptcy or receivership or in proceedings for reorganization pursuant to the Federal bankruptcy laws, as now or hereafter constituted, or any other Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law;
     (B) to realize, for its own account, upon any property held by it as security for any such claim, if such property was so held prior to the beginning of such three-month period;
     (C) to realize, for its own account, but only to the extent of the claim hereinafter or mentioned, upon any property held by it as security for any such claim, if such claim was created after the beginning of such three-month period and such property was received as security therefor simultaneously with the creation thereof, and if the Trustee shall sustain the burden of proving that at the time such property was so received the Trustee had no reasonable cause to believe that a default as defined in Subsection (c) of this Section would occur within three months; or

     (i) the receipt of property or reduction of claim, which would have given rise to the obligation to account, if such Trustee had continued as Trustee, occurred after the beginning of such three-months period; and
     (ii) such receipt of property or reduction of claim occurred within three months after such resignation or removal.
     (b) There shall be excluded from the operation of Subsection (a) of this Section a creditor relationship arising from:
     (1) the ownership or acquisition of securities issued under any indenture, or any securities or securities having a maturity of one year or more at the time of acquisition by the Trustee;

     (2) The term "other indenture securities" means securities upon which the Company is an obligor outstanding under any other indenture (i) under which the Trustee is also trustee, (ii) which contains provisions substantially similar to the provisions of this Section, and (iii) under which a default exists at the time of the apportionment of the funds and property held in such special account.
     (3) The term "cash transaction" means any transaction in which full payment for goods or securities sold is made within seven days after delivery of the goods or securities in currency or in checks or other orders drawn upon banks or bankers and payable upon demand.

     In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the Securities thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate.

     (3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.
     The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
     Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Security and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal or premium, if any or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
provided, however,

     SECTION 10.05. .
Maintenance of Properties
     The Company will maintain and keep its properties and every part thereof in such repair, working order and condition, and make or cause to be made all such needful and proper repairs, renewals and replacements thereto, as in the judgment of the Company are necessary in the interests of the Company; that nothing contained in this Section shall prevent the Company from selling, abandoning or otherwise disposing of any of its properties or discontinuing a part of its business from time to time if, in the judgment of the Company, such sale, abandonment, disposition or discontinuance is advisable and does not materially adversely affect the interests or business of the Company.

Statement as to Default
     The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company (which as of the date hereof is December 31), an Officers' Certificate stating that in the course of the performance by the signers of their duties as Officers of the Company, they would normally have knowledge of any failure by the Company to comply with all conditions, or any Default by the Company with respect to any covenants, under this Indenture, and further stating whether or not they have knowledge of any such failure or Default and, if so, specifying each such failure or Default and the nature thereof. In the event an Officer of the Company comes to have actual knowledge of a Default, regardless of the date, the Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee specifying such Default and the nature and status thereof.
     SECTION 10.07. .
Corporate Existence
     Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence, rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the Company determines that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.
provided, however,
     SECTION 10.08. .
Waiver of Certain Covenants
     The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any covenant or condition set forth in Section 10.04, 10.05 and 10.07 or any covenant added for the benefit of any series of Securities as contemplated by Section 3.01, if before or after the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities of such series at the time Outstanding shall, by Act of such Holders, waive such compliance in such instance, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such covenant or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such covenant or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
 
53
     SECTION 10.09. .

     The Company shall file with the Trustee promptly at the end of each calendar year (i) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount (including daily rates and accrual periods) accrued on Outstanding Securities as of the end of such year and (ii) such other specific information relating to such original issue discount as may then be relevant under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.
     SECTION 10.10.
Reports.
     (a) The Company shall deliver to the Trustee within 15 days after it files them with the Commission copies of the annual reports and of the information, documents, and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Company is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; the Company shall not be required to deliver to the Trustee any materials for which the Company has sought and received confidential treatment by the Commission. The Company also shall comply with the other provisions of Section 314(a) of the Trust Indenture Act.
provided, however,
     (b) Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).
     (c) If at any time the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, upon the request of a Holder of a Security, the Company will promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to such Holder or to a prospective purchaser of such Security designated by such Holder, as the case may be, the information, if any, required to be delivered by it pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to permit compliance with Rule 144A in connection with the resale of such Security.
     SECTION 11.01. . The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to the Securities of any series which are redeemable before their maturity except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of such series.
Applicability of Article

Such mailing shall be by first class mail. The notice if mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice.
Notice of Redemption; Selection of Securities
 
54
In any case, failure to give such notice by mail or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such series.
     Each such notice of redemption shall include CUSIP numbers and specify the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price at which Securities of such series are to be redeemed, the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities, that any interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice, and that on and after said date any interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed the notice of redemption shall specify the numbers of the Securities of that series to be redeemed. In case any Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of that series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
     Prior to 10:00 am on the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section 11.02, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities or portions thereof so called for redemption at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption.
     If all or less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Company will give the Trustee notice not less than 60 days prior to the redemption date as to the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be redeemed and the Trustee shall select, in such manner as in its sole discretion it shall deem appropriate, the Securities of that series or portions thereof (in multiples of $1,000, except as otherwise set forth in the applicable form of Security) to be redeemed.
     SECTION 11.03. . If notice of redemption has been given as provided in Section 11.02 or Section 12.03, the Securities or portions of Securities of the series with respect to which such notice has been given shall become due and payable on the date and at the place or places stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with any interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Securities at the applicable redemption price, together with any interest accrued to said date) any interest on the Securities or portions of Securities of any series so called for redemption shall cease to accrue. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a place of payment in said notice specified, the said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price, together with any interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption.
Payment of Securities Called for Redemption
     Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of such series, of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.
 
55
     SECTION 12.01. . The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of such series.
Applicability of Article
     The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment".
     SECTION 12.02. . In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any Securities of a series in cash, the Company may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of that series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company, or (b) receive credit for the principal amount of Securities of that series which have been previously delivered by the Trustee to the Company which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities; that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
Satisfaction of Mandatory Sinking Fund Payments with Securities
provided
     SECTION 12.03. . Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee a certificate signed by the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Company specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering or crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 12.02 (which Securities will, if not previously delivered, accompany such certificate) and whether the Company intends to exercise its right to make a permitted optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series. Such certificate shall also state that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to such series. Such certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its delivery the Company shall be obligated to make the cash payment or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. In the case of the failure of the Company to deliver such certificate (or to deliver the Securities specified in this paragraph), the sinking fund payment due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date for that series shall be paid entirely in cash and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amount of such Securities subject to a mandatory sinking fund payment without the option to deliver or credit Securities as provided in Section 12.02 and without the right to make any optional sinking fund payment, if any, with respect to such series.
Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund
     Any sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional) made in cash plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash which shall equal or
 
56
exceed $100,000 (or a lesser sum if the Company shall so request) with respect to the Securities of any particular series shall be applied by the Trustee on the sinking fund payment date on which such payment is made (or, if such payment is made before a sinking fund payment date, on the sinking fund payment date following the date of such payment) to the redemption of such Securities at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for operation of the sinking fund together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. Any sinking fund moneys not so applied or allocated by the Trustee to the redemption of Securities shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment received by the Trustee for such series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.03. Any and all sinking fund moneys with respect to the Securities of any particular series held by the Trustee on the last sinking fund payment date with respect to Securities of such series and not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities shall be applied by the Trustee, together with other moneys, if necessary, to be deposited sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of the Securities of that series at maturity.
     The Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in the last paragraph of Section 11.02 and the Company shall cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the manner provided in Section 11.02 except that the notice of redemption shall also state that the Securities are being redeemed by operation of the sinking fund. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 11.03.
     Prior to 10:00 am on each sinking fund payment date, the Company shall pay to the Trustee in cash a sum equal to any interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption of Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed on such sinking fund payment date pursuant to this Section.
     The Trustee shall not redeem any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of such Securities by operation of the sinking fund for such series during the continuance of a default in payment of interest on such Securities or of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default occurring as a consequence of this paragraph) with respect to such Securities, except that if the notice of redemption of any such Securities shall theretofore have been mailed in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Trustee shall redeem such Securities if cash sufficient for that purpose shall be deposited with the Trustee for that purpose in accordance with the terms of this Article. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur and any moneys thereafter paid into such sinking fund shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be held as security for the payment of such Securities; that in case such Event of Default or default shall have cured or waived as provided herein, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next sinking fund payment date for such Securities on which such moneys may be applied pursuant to the provisions of this Section.
provided, however,

     SECTION 14.01. . The Company agrees, and each Holder by accepting a Security agrees, that the payment of all obligations owing in respect of the Securities is subordinated in right of payment, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article Fourteen, to the prior payment in full of all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Company and that the subordination is for the benefit of and enforceable by the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. The Securities shall in all respects rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company, and will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company; and only indebtedness of the Company that is Senior Indebtedness shall rank senior to the Securities in accordance with the provisions set forth herein. All provisions of this Article Fourteen shall be subject to Section 14.12.
Agreement to Subordinate
     SECTION 14.02. . Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of the Company to creditors upon a total or partial liquidation or a total or partial dissolution of the Company or in a reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to the Company or its property:
Liquidation, Dissolution, Bankruptcy
     (a) the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of such Senior Indebtedness before Holders shall be entitled to receive any payment; and
     (b) until the Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full in cash, any payment or distribution to which Holders would be entitled but for the subordination provisions of this Indenture shall be made to holders of such Senior Indebtedness as their interests may appear, except that Holders may receive Permitted Junior Securities.
     SECTION 14.03. . The Company shall not pay principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities (or pay any other obligations relating to the Securities, including additional interest, fees, costs, expenses, indemnities and rescission or damage claims) or make any deposit pursuant to Article Four or Article Thirteen hereof and may not purchase, redeem or otherwise retire any Securities (collectively, "pay the Securities") (except in the form of Permitted Junior Securities) if either of the following occurs (a "Payment Default"):
Default on Senior Indebtedness of the Company
 
60
     (a) any obligation on any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company is not paid in full in cash when due (after giving effect to any applicable grace period); or
     (b) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms;
unless, in either case, the Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to pay the Securities without regard to the foregoing if the Company and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representatives of all Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Payment Default has occurred and is continuing.
During the continuance of any default (other than a Payment Default) (a "Non-Payment Default") with respect to any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company pursuant to which the maturity thereof may be accelerated without further notice (except such notice as may be required to effect such acceleration) or the expiration of any applicable grace periods, the Company shall not pay the Securities (except in the form of Permitted Junior Securities) for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period") commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee (with a copy to the Company) of written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such Non-Payment Default from the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. So long as there shall remain outstanding any Senior Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities, a Blockage Notice may be given only by the administrative agent thereunder unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the requisite lenders named therein. The Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Payment Blockage Period is terminated (i) by written notice to the Trustee and the Company from the Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice; (ii) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (iii) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash.
     Notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding two sentences (but subject to the provisions contained in the first sentence of this Section 14.03 and Section 14.02 hereof), unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or a Payment Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall be entitled to resume paying the Securities after the end of such Payment Blockage Period. The Securities shall not be subject to more than one Payment Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company during such period; provided that if any Blockage Notice is delivered to the Trustee by or on behalf of the holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company (other than the holders of indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities), a Representative of holders of indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities may give another Blockage Notice within such period. However, in no event shall the total number of days during which any Payment Blockage Period or Periods on the Securities is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be at least 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Payment Blockage Period is in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no default that existed or was continuing on the date of
 
61
delivery of any Blockage Notice to the Trustee shall be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Blockage Notice unless such default shall have been waived for a period of not less than 90 days (it being acknowledged that any subsequent action, or any breach of any financial covenants during the period after the date of delivery of a Blockage Notice, that, in either case, would give rise to a Non-Payment Default pursuant to any provisions under which a Non-Payment Default previously existed or was continuing shall constitute a new Non-Payment Default for this purpose).
     SECTION 14.04. . If payment of the Securities is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness of the acceleration; provided that any failure to give such notice shall have no effect whatsoever on the provisions of this Article Fourteen. If any Designated Senior Indebtedness of the Company is outstanding, the Company may not pay the Securities until five Business Days after the Representatives of all the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness receive notice of such acceleration and, thereafter, may pay the Securities only if this Indenture otherwise permits payment at that time.
Acceleration of Payment of Securities
     SECTION 14.05. . If a distribution is made to Holders that, due to the subordination provisions, should not have been made to them, such Holders are required to hold it in trust for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and pay it over to them as their interests may appear.
When Distribution Must Be Paid Over
     SECTION 14.06. . After all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full and until the Securities are paid in full, Holders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to such Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under this Article Fourteen to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Holders is not, as between the Company and Holders, a payment by the Company on such Senior Indebtedness.
Subrogation
     SECTION 14.07. . This Article Fourteen defines the relative rights of Holders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
Relative Rights
     (a) impair, as between the Company and Holders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay principal of and interest on the Securities in accordance with their terms;
     (b) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a Default, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to receive payments or distributions otherwise payable to Holders and such other rights of such holders of Senior Indebtedness as set forth herein; or
     (c) affect the relative rights of Holders and creditors of the Company other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Indebtedness.
     SECTION 14.08. . No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to enforce the subordination of the indebtedness
Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company
 
62
evidenced by the Securities shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Company or by their failure to comply with this Indenture.
     SECTION 14.09. . Notwithstanding Section 14.03 hereof, the Trustee or any Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Securities and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would prohibit the making of any payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives notice satisfactory to him that payments may not be made under this Article Fourteen. The Company, the Security Registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of the Company has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice.
Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent
     The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be entitled to hold Senior Indebtedness of the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. The Security Registrar and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article Fourteen with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of the Company which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article Six shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article Fourteen shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof or any other Section of this Indenture.
     SECTION 14.10. . Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative (if any).
Distribution or Notice to Representative
     SECTION 14.11. . The failure to make a payment pursuant to the Securities by reason of any provision in this Article Fourteen shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a Default. Nothing in this Article Fourteen shall have any effect on the right of the Holders or the Trustee to accelerate the maturity of the Securities.
Article Fourteen Not to Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right to Accelerate
     SECTION 14.12. . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from money or the proceeds of U.S. Government Obligations held in trust by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the Securities pursuant to Article Four or Article Thirteen hereof shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article Fourteen, and none of the Holders shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to the Company or any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or any other creditor of the Company, provided that the subordination provisions of this Article Fourteen were not violated at the time the applicable amounts were deposited in trust pursuant to Article Four or Article Thirteen hereof, as the case may be.
Trust Moneys Not Subordinated
     SECTION 14.13. . Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Fourteen, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely (a) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in
Trustee Entitled to Rely
 
63
Section 14.02 hereof are pending, (b) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders or (c) upon the Representatives of Senior Indebtedness of the Company for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article Fourteen. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Fourteen, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article Fourteen, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Section 6.01 and Section 6.03 hereof shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article Fourteen.
     SECTION 14.14. . A Holder by its acceptance of a Security agrees to be bound by this Article Fourteen and authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee, on his behalf, to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination between the Holders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company as provided in this Article Fourteen and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
Trustee to Effectuate Subordination
     SECTION 14.15. . The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders or the Company or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Fourteen or otherwise.
Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company
     SECTION 14.16. . Each Holder by accepting a Security acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Securities, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.
Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company on Subordination Provisions
     Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders, without incurring responsibility to the Trustee or the Holders and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article Fourteen or the obligations hereunder of the Holders to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of the Company, do any one or more of the following: (a) change the manner, place or terms of
 
64
payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness of the Company, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner Senior Indebtedness of the Company, or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness of the Company is outstanding; (b) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness of the Company; (c) release any Person liable in any manner for the payment or collection of Senior Indebtedness of the Company; and (d) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company and any other Person.
     SECTION 14.17. . The terms of this Article Fourteen shall not apply to payments from money or the proceeds of U.S. Government Obligations held in trust by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the Securities pursuant to Sections 13.02 and 13.03.

Guarantee
     If the Company fails to make any payment when due of any amount so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantor of the Securities of that series shall be obligated, jointly and severally with each other Guarantor, if any, to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be continuing, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Securities, this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Securities or the Trustee with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of such Guarantor. Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, demand
 
65

Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders of Securities of a series guaranteed hereby by such Guarantor in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby by such Guarantee until payment in full of all such obligations. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders of Securities of a series guaranteed hereby by such Guarantor and the Trustee on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article Five hereof for the purposes of such Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby and (ii) in the event of any acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article Five hereof such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Guarantor, jointly and severally with any other Guarantor of such Securities, for the purpose of this Article Fifteen. In addition, without limiting the foregoing, upon the effectiveness of an acceleration under Article Five, the Trustee may make a demand for payment on the Securities under any Guarantee provided hereunder and not discharged.
     With respect to each Guarantee by a Guarantor, such Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Holder of any Securities guaranteed hereby by such Guarantee against the Company in respect of any amounts paid to such Holder by such Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of such Guarantee; that the Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce, or to receive any payments arising out of or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of and interest on all such Securities shall have been paid in full.

Obligations of the Guarantor Unconditional

All provisions of this Article Sixteen shall be subject to Section 16.12.
     SECTION 16.02. . Upon any payment or distribution of the assets of a Guarantor to creditors upon a total or partial liquidation or a total or partial dissolution of such Guarantor or in a reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to such Guarantor or its property:

     SECTION 16.03. . A Guarantor shall not make any payment pursuant to its Guarantee (or pay any other obligations relating to its Guarantee, including additional interest, fees, costs, expenses, indemnities and rescission or damage claims) and may not purchase, redeem or otherwise retire any Securities (collectively, "pay its Guarantee") (except in the form of Permitted Junior Securities) if either of the following occurs (a "Guarantor Payment Default"):
Default on Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor
     (a) any obligation on any Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor is not paid in full in cash when due (after giving effect to any applicable grace period); or
     (b) any other default on Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor occurs and the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness is accelerated in accordance with its terms;
unless, in either case, the Guarantor Payment Default has been cured or waived and any such acceleration has been rescinded or such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash; provided, however, that such Guarantor shall be entitled to pay its Guarantee without regard to the foregoing if such Guarantor and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment from the Representatives of all Designated Senior Indebtedness with respect to which the Guarantor Payment Default has occurred and is continuing.

Designated Senior Indebtedness specifying an election to effect a Guarantee Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter. So long as there shall remain outstanding any Senior Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities, a Guarantee Blockage Notice may be given only by the administrative agent thereunder unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the requisite lenders named therein. The Guarantee Payment Blockage Period shall end earlier if such Guarantee Payment Blockage Period is terminated (i) by written notice to the Trustee, the relevant Guarantor and the Company from the Person or Persons who gave such Guarantee Blockage Notice; (ii) because the default giving rise to such Guarantee Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer continuing; or (iii) because such Designated Senior Indebtedness has been discharged or repaid in full in cash. Notwithstanding the provisions described in the immediately preceding two sentences (but subject to the provisions contained in the first sentence of this Section 16.03 and Section 16.02 hereof), unless the holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness shall have accelerated the maturity of such Designated Senior Indebtedness or a Guarantor Payment Default has occurred and is continuing, the relevant Guarantor shall be entitled to resume paying its Guarantee after the end of such Guarantee Payment Blockage Period. Each Guarantee shall not be subject to more than one Guarantee Payment Blockage Period in any consecutive 360-day period irrespective of the number of defaults with respect to Designated Senior Indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor during such period; that if any Guarantee Blockage Notice is delivered to the Trustee by or on behalf of the holders of Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor (other than the holders of indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities), a Representative of holders of indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities may give another Guarantee Blockage Notice within such period. However, in no event shall the total number of days during which any Guarantee Payment Blockage Period or Periods on a Guarantee is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 360-day period, and there must be at least 181 days during any consecutive 360-day period during which no Guarantee Payment Blockage Period is in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Guarantee Blockage Notice to the Trustee shall be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Guarantee Blockage Notice unless such default shall have been waived for a period of not less than 90 days (it being acknowledged that any subsequent action, or any breach of any financial covenants during the period after the date of delivery of a Guarantee Blockage Notice, that, in either case, would give rise to a Non-Guarantor Payment Default pursuant to any provisions under which a Non-Guarantor Payment Default previously existed or was continuing shall constitute a new Non-Guarantor Payment Default for this purpose).
provided
     SECTION 16.04. . If payment of the Securities is accelerated because of an Event of Default and a demand for payment is made on a Guarantor pursuant to Article Fifteen hereof, the Company or such Guarantor shall promptly notify the holders of the Designated Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor or the Representative of such Designated Senior Indebtedness of such demand; provided that any failure to give such notice shall have no effect whatsoever on the provisions of this Article Sixteen. If any Designated Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor is outstanding, such Guarantor may not pay its Guarantee until five Business Days after the Representatives with respect to such Designated Senior Indebtedness receive notice of such acceleration and, thereafter, may pay its Guarantee only if this Indenture otherwise permits payment at that time.
Demand for Payment
 
69
     SECTION 16.05. . If a distribution is made to Holders that, due to the subordination provisions, should not have been made to them, such Holders are required to hold it in trust for the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor and pay it over to them as their interests may appear.
When Distribution Must Be Paid Over
     SECTION 16.06. . After all Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor is paid in full and until the Securities are paid in full, Holders shall be subrogated to the rights of holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive distributions applicable to such Senior Indebtedness. A distribution made under this Article Sixteen to holders of such Senior Indebtedness which otherwise would have been made to Holders is not, as between the relevant Guarantor and Holders, a payment by such Guarantor on such Senior Indebtedness.
Subrogation
     SECTION 16.07. . This Article Sixteen defines the relative rights of Holders and holders of Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor. Nothing in this Indenture shall:
Relative Rights
     (a) impair, as between such Guarantor and Holders, the obligation of such Guarantor, which is absolute and unconditional, to make payments under its Guarantee in accordance with its terms;
     (b) prevent the Trustee or any Holder from exercising its available remedies upon a default by such Guarantor under its obligations with respect to its Guarantee, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor to receive payments or distributions otherwise payable to Holders and such other rights of such holders of Senior Indebtedness as set forth herein; or
     (c) affect the relative rights of Holders and creditors of such Guarantor other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Indebtedness.
     SECTION 16.08. . No right of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor to enforce the subordination of the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by such Guarantor or by its failure to comply with this Indenture.
Subordination May Not Be Impaired by a Guarantor
     SECTION 16.09. . Notwithstanding Section 16.03 hereof, the Trustee or any Paying Agent may continue to make payments on the Securities and shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of facts that would prohibit the making of any payments unless, not less than two Business Days prior to the date of such payment, a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives notice satisfactory to him that payments may not be made under this Article Sixteen. A Guarantor, the Security Registrar, the Paying Agent, a Representative or a holder of Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor shall be entitled to give the notice; provided, however, that, if an issue of Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor has a Representative, only the Representative shall be entitled to give the notice.
Rights of Trustee and Paying Agent
     The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity shall be entitled to hold Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. The Security Registrar and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to do the same with like rights. The Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article Sixteen with respect to any Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as
 
70
any other holder of such Senior Indebtedness; and nothing in Article Six shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. Nothing in this Article Sixteen shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof or any other Section of this Indenture.
     SECTION 16.10. . Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their Representative (if any).
Distribution or Notice to Representative
     SECTION 16.11. . The failure of a Guarantor to make a payment pursuant its Guarantee by reason of any provision in this Article Sixteen shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of a default by such Guarantor under its Guarantee. Nothing in this Article Sixteen shall have any effect on the right of the Holders or the Trustee to make a demand for payment on a Guarantor pursuant to Article Sixteen hereof.
Article Sixteen Not to Prevent Events of Default or Limit Right to Demand Payment
     SECTION 16.12. . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, payments from money or the proceeds of U.S. Government Obligations held in trust by the Trustee for the payment of principal of and interest on the Securities pursuant to Article Four or Article Thirteen hereof shall not be subordinated to the prior payment of any Senior Indebtedness of any Guarantor or subject to the restrictions set forth in this Article Sixeen, and none of the Holders shall be obligated to pay over any such amount to such Guarantor or any holder of Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor or any other creditor of such Guarantor, provided that the subordination provisions of this Article Sixteen were not violated at the time the applicable amounts were deposited in trust pursuant to Article Four or Article Thirteen hereof, as the case may be.
Trust Moneys Not Subordinated
     SECTION 16.13. . Upon any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Sixteen, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely (a) upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which any proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 16.02 hereof are pending, (b) upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making such payment or distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders or (c) upon the Representatives of Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of such Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article Sixteen. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Sixteen, the Trustee shall be entitled to request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article Sixteen, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee shall be entitled to defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. The provisions of Section 6.01 and Section 6.03 hereof shall be applicable to all actions or omissions of actions by the Trustee pursuant to this Article Sixteen.
Trustee Entitled to Rely
 
71
     SECTION 16.14. . A Holder by its acceptance of a Security agrees to be bound by this Article Sixteen and authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee, on his behalf, to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination between the Holders and the holders of Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor as provided in this Article Sixteen and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
Trustee to Effectuate Subordination
     SECTION 16.15. . The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders or such Guarantor or any other Person, money or assets to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Sixteen or otherwise.
Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness of Guarantors
     SECTION 16.16. . Each Holder by accepting a Security acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provisions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a consideration to each holder of any Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor, whether such Senior Indebtedness was created or acquired before or after the issuance of the Securities, to acquire and continue to hold, or to continue to hold, such Senior Indebtedness and such holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Indebtedness.
Reliance by Holders of Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor on Subordination Provisions
     Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders, without incurring responsibility to the Trustee or the Holders and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article Sixteen or the obligations hereunder of the Holders to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor, do any one or more of the following: (a) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor, or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor is outstanding; (b) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor; (c) release any Person liable in any manner for the payment or collection of Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor; or (d) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against such Guarantor and any other Person.
     SECTION 17.01. .
Form of Documents Delivered to Trustee
     In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only
 
72
one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.
     Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate of opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate or Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the Company stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.
     Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.
     SECTION 17.02. .
Notices
     Any notice or communication by the Company, any Guarantor or the Trustee to the others is duly given if in writing and delivered in Person or mailed by first class mail (registered or certified, return receipt requested), telex, telecopier or overnight air courier guaranteeing next day delivery, to the others' address.

however

Any notice or communication shall also be so mailed to any Person described in TIA  313(c), to the extent required by the TIA.

     If the Company mails a notice or communication to Holders, it shall mail a copy to the Trustee and each Agent at the same time.

Notice to Holders; Waiver

In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
     In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

     (2) an Opinion of Counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (which shall include the statements set forth in Section 17.06 hereof) stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all such conditions precedent and covenants, if any, have been satisfied, except that in the case of any such application or request as to which the furnishing of such documents is specifically required by any provision of this Indenture relating to such particular application or request, no additional certificate or opinion need be furnished.

Each Holder of the Securities by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Securities.

For purposes of determining compliance with the foregoing limitation on any Extension Period, (x) only when all Deferred Interest has been paid shall any Extension Period end; and (y) after the commencement of an Extension Period, the period from the first Interest Payment Date for which interest is deferred pursuant to Section 2.6 or Section 2.7 and ending on the date on which all Deferred Interest, including Compounded Interest, is paid in full, shall be included for purposes of calculating the length of an Extension Period.
     Section 2.9 .
Right to Optional Redemption by the Company
     (a) The Debentures will not be subject to redemption prior to December 20, 2011. Subject to clauses (c) and (d) below, the Debentures are subject to redemption, at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, (i) between December 20, 2011 and December 19, 2036, at any time at which the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock for at least 20 Trading Days in the 30 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the date one Trading Day prior to the day the Company gives a notice of redemption is greater than 130% of the Conversion Price applicable to the relevant Trading Day and (ii) on or after December 20, 2036 at any time, in each case at a redemption price in cash equal to the Par Redemption Amount.
     (b) Any such redemption shall be governed by Article 11 of the Base Indenture.
 
     (c) The Company may not redeem any Debentures unless all accrued and unpaid interest on all Outstanding Debentures, including Deferred Interest, if any, has been paid in full for all Interest Payment Periods terminating on or prior to the Redemption Date.
     (d) If any Perpetual Preferred Stock is outstanding, the Company may not optionally redeem any Debentures unless it first gives irrevocable notice of redemption, pursuant to Section 7 of the Perpetual Preferred Stock Certificate of Designations, of the Perpetual Preferred Stock in whole or, if the redemption of the Debentures is in part, in the same proportion as the redemption of the Debentures. For the avoidance of doubt, this restriction does not apply to the Company's obligation to repay the Debentures at the Scheduled Maturity Date pursuant to Section 2.10 hereof.
     (e) Each notice that the Debentures are being redeemed pursuant to the Indenture, shall, in addition to setting forth the information required pursuant to Section 11.02 of the Base Indenture, state that the Debentures are being optionally redeemed pursuant to the Indenture and set forth the facts permitting such redemption and, if less than all outstanding Debentures are to be redeemed, to the extent that the Debentures are not all held in global form, shall identify the particular Debentures to be redeemed.
     (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11.02 of the Base Indenture, if the Debentures are held in book-entry form through DTC, the Company may give notice of redemption in any manner permitted by DTC, with a copy to the Trustee.
     (g) Any notice of redemption, once given by the Company, shall be irrevocable.
     (h) If the Par Redemption Amount in respect of any Debentures called for redemption is not paid on the Redemption Date, such amount shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the Debenture Interest Rate compounded semiannually.
     Section 2.10 .
Scheduled Maturity
     (a) On each Repayment Date, the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all then Outstanding Debentures shall be payable in full, provided that in the event the Company has delivered an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee pursuant to and in accordance with clause (d) of this Section 2.10 in connection with such Repayment Date, (A) the amounts of principal and interest in respect of the Debentures that the Company is obligated to pay on such Repayment Date, if any, shall be the amounts set forth in the notice of repayment accompanying such Officers' Certificate and (B) such amounts of principal and interest in respect of the Debentures shall be due and payable on such Repayment Date pursuant to this Section 2.10. In the event that the Company does not deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee on or prior to the tenth Business Day immediately preceding any Repayment Date, the entire principal of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all Outstanding Debentures shall be due and payable on such Repayment Date.
     (b) The principal of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all Outstanding Debentures shall be due and payable on the Final Maturity Date.
 
     (c) The obligation of the Company to repay the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.10 on any date prior to the Final Maturity Date shall be subject to (A) its obligations under Article Fourteen of the Base Indenture as amended by this First Supplemental Indenture to the holders of Senior Indebtedness and (B) its obligations under Section 2.7 with respect to the payment of Mandatorily Deferred Interest.
     (d) The Company shall, if it has not raised sufficient QCS Proceeds in connection with any Repayment Date to repay principal and interest on all then Outstanding Debentures in full, deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee (who shall forward such certificate to each Holder of Debentures as soon as practicable) no more than 15 and no less than 10 Business Days in advance of such Repayment Date stating the amount of QCS Proceeds, if any, raised in connection with such Repayment Date. Each Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to this clause (d), unless no principal amount of Debentures is to be repaid on the applicable Repayment Date, shall be accompanied by a notice of repayment pursuant to Section 2.10(h) setting forth the amounts of interest and principal in respect of the Debentures that the Company will repay on such Repayment Date, which amounts shall be equal to or greater than the amount of QCS Proceeds to be applied thereto pursuant to clause (e) of this Section 2.10.
     (e) QCS Proceeds shall be applied by the Company first, to pay Mandatorily Deferred Interest (to the extent that such QCS Proceeds are also APM Eligible Proceeds), second, to pay Optionally Deferred Interest (provided that if such payment is to be made following the date that is five years following the first Interest Payment Date as of which the Company commenced an Optional Extension Period (as may be extended by any Mandatory Extension Period occurring within such Optional Extension Period), only to the extent that such QCS Proceeds are also APM Eligible Proceeds), third, to pay current interest to the extent not paid from other sources, and fourth, to pay the principal of the Debentures, subject to a minimum principal amount of $5 million to be repaid on any Repayment Date; that if the Company is obligated to sell Qualifying Capital Securities and apply the net proceeds to payments of principal of or interest on any other outstanding securities that rank pari passu with the Debentures, then on any date and for any period the amount of APM Eligible Proceeds received by the Company from those sales and available for such payments shall be applied to the Debentures and those other equal-ranking securities in accordance with their respective outstanding principal amounts.
provided
pro rata
     (f) If less than all the Debentures are to be repaid on any Repayment Date, the particular Debentures to be repaid shall be selected prior to such Repayment Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Debentures not previously repaid or called for redemption, by lot or such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Debentures, that the portion of the principal amount of any Debentures not repaid shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination of $1,000) for such Debentures.
provided
     (g) The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Debentures selected for partial repayment and the principal amount thereof to be repaid. For all purposes hereof, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the repayment of Debentures shall relate, in the case of any Debentures repaid or to be repaid only in part, to the
 
portion of the principal amount of such Debentures which has been or is to be repaid. If the Company shall so direct in writing, Debentures registered in the name of the Company, any Affiliate or any Subsidiary thereof shall not be included in the Debentures selected for repayment.
     (h) Notice of repayment shall be given by the Company by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not earlier than the 15th Business Day, and not later than the tenth Business Day, prior to the Repayment Date, to each Holder of Debentures to be repaid, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Securities Register, with a copy to the Trustee. Each notice of repayment shall identify the Debentures to be repaid (including CUSIP number, if a CUSIP number has been assigned to the Debentures) and shall state:
     (i) the Repayment Date;
     (ii) the payment amount and the manner of its calculation;
     (iii) that the Debentures are being paid pursuant to the Indenture;
     (iv) if less than all Outstanding Debentures are to be paid, the identification (and, in the case of partial repayment, the respective principal amounts) of the particular Debentures to be paid;
     (v) that on the Repayment Date, the principal amount of the Debentures to be paid shall become due and payable upon each such Debenture or portion thereof, and that interest thereon, if any, shall cease to accrue on and after said date; and
     (vi) the place or places where such Debentures are to be surrendered for payment of the principal amount thereof.
Notice of repayment shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall be irrevocable. The notice if mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. In any case, a failure to give such notice by mail or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Debentures designated for repayment as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the repayment of any other Debentures.
     (i) Prior to 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the Repayment Date specified in the notice of repayment given as provided in Section 2.10(h), the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money sufficient to pay the principal amount of, and any accrued interest (including Deferred Interest and Compounded Interest) on, all the Debentures which are to be repaid on that date.
     (j) If any notice of repayment has been given as provided in Section 2.10(h), the Debentures or portion of the Debentures with respect to which such notice has been given shall become due and payable on the date and at the place or places stated in such notice. On presentation and surrender of such Debentures at a place of payment in said notice specified, the said securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid by the Company at their principal
 
amount, together with accrued interest (including any Deferred Interest and Compounded Interest) to the Repayment Date.
     (k) Upon presentation of any Debentures repaid in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, new Debentures, of authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the portion of the Debentures not repaid and so presented and having the same original issue date and terms. If a Global Debenture is so surrendered, such new Debenture shall also be a new Global Debenture. If any Global Debenture is repaid in part only, and the Depositary so permits, the Trustee or a custodian at the direction of the Trustee shall make a notation on such Global Debenture as to the reduction in the principal amount in lieu of new Debentures being authenticated and delivered.
     (l) If any Debentures called for repayment shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof, the principal of such Debentures shall, until paid, bear interest from the Repayment Date at the Debenture Interest Rate.

Event of Default
     (i) default for 30 calendar days in the payment of any interest on the Debentures, including any Compounded Interest, when it becomes due and payable under the Indenture; provided, however, that the deferral of interest during an Extension Period satisfying Section 2.6 or Section 2.7, as applicable, and Section 2.8, as applicable, hereof shall not constitute a default in the payment of interest;
     (ii) deferral of interest on the Debentures, due to a mandatory deferral or optional deferral, or combination thereof, that continues for 10 consecutive years after the date on which the Company began the deferral of interest without all Deferred Interest, including any Compounded Interest, having been paid in full on or prior to the day that is 30 days after the date that is 10 years after the commencement of such deferral;
     (iii) default in the payment of the principal of the Debentures when due; or
     (iv) an Event of Default as set forth in clause (e) of Section 5.01 of the Base Indenture.

Holder or beneficial owner of a Debenture, as the case may be, shall have any claim for, or right to receive, any Foregone Interest and any Foregone Interest shall not be due and payable.
     (c) For the avoidance of doubt, (A) the use of sources of funding other than the Warrant and Preferred Stock Settlement Mechanism to fund (i) interest payments during a Mandatory Extension Period or (ii) payments of Optionally Deferred Interest following the date that is five years (as may be extended by any Mandatory Extension Period occurring within an Optional Extension Period) following the first Interest Payment Date as of which the Company commenced an Optional Extension Period or (B) the failure of the Company to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell Qualifying Capital Securities pursuant to Section 3.3 or to apply QCS Proceeds pursuant to Section 2.10(e), shall, in neither case, be an Event of Default hereunder, but shall constitute a Covenant Breach hereunder.
     Section 2.12 . The Base Indenture is hereby amended and supplemented with respect to the Debentures as follows:
Covenant Breaches
     (a) Section 5.05 is amended in its entirety as follows: "No Holder of a 4.75% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debenture (a "") shall have any right by virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (i) (A) such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of default and of the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided, with a copy to the Company, or (B) the Trustee shall have previously given notice of such default to the Company, (ii) the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures then Outstanding, or a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures then Outstanding, in the case of a Covenant Breach (as defined in the First Supplemental Indenture hereto, dated as of December 20, 2006), shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as Trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, (iii) the Trustee for 90 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding during such 90-day period, and (iv) during such 90-day period no direction inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures then Outstanding (or such amount as shall have acted at a meeting pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture), it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the Holder of every Debenture with every other Holder and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holder, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such Holder, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all such Holders.
Debenture

such payment on or after such respective dates or for the enforcement of the Company's obligation to deliver conversion consideration when due shall not be impaired or affected without the written consent of such Holder."
     (b) Section 5.06 is amended in its entirety as follows: "If an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of the Debentures by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
     If a Covenant Breach with respect to the Debentures occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. If a Covenant Breach with respect to the Debentures occurs and is continuing, and then only if the Trustee is directed by Holders of Debentures pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5.08 hereof and, if so requested by the Trustee, an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it is granted by the Holders, the Trustee shall proceed to protect and enforce the rights of the Holders of the Debentures by such appropriate judicial proceedings as such Holders shall so direct to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy."
     (c) Section 5.08 is amended in its entirety as follows: "The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures at the time Outstanding shall have the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Debentures; provided, however, that (subject to the provisions of Section 6.01) the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that the action or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that the action or proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Subject to Section 5.02, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures at the time Outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Debentures waive any past Covenant Breach, default or Event of Default described in Section 5.01, or any other Event of Default for such series specified in the terms thereof as contemplated by Section 3.01, and its consequences except a default in the payment of interest on, or the principal of, any of the Debentures or a default in respect of a provision of this Indenture that, under Section 9.02, cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each Holder of each Debenture affected by such modification or amendment. Upon any such waiver the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debentures shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Covenant Breach, default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any Covenant Breach, default or Event of Default hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by this Section 5.08, said Covenant Breach, default or Event of Default shall for all purposes of the Debentures and this Indenture be deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing."
 
     (d) The final sentence of Section 6.02 is amended in its entirety as follows: "For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, a Covenant Breach or Event of Default."
     (e) The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that in the case of any failure to deliver consideration deliverable in respect of any conversion (other than a conversion upon notice of redemption or in connection with a Non-Stock Change of Control), monetary damages would not be adequate and hereby specify specific performance as the remedy for any such failure.

     (ii) at any time after the Company has issued a notice of redemption of the Debentures pursuant to Article 11 of the Base Indenture and Section 2.9 hereof until 5:00 p.m., New York City Time, on the last Business Day preceding the Redemption Date;
     (iii) during the 10 Trading Days immediately following any five-consecutive-Trading-Day period in which the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of the Debentures for each day of such five-consecutive-Trading-Day period is determined, after a request to conduct such measurement, to be less than 98% of the product of the Closing Sale Price per share of the Company's

     The Trustee (or other conversion agent appointed by the Company) shall, upon the request of, and on behalf of, the Company, determine whether the Debentures shall be convertible as a result of the occurrence of an event specified in clause (iii) above and, if the Debentures shall be so convertible, the Trustee (or other conversion agent appointed by the Company) shall promptly deliver to the Company and the Trustee (if the Trustee is not the conversion agent) written notice thereof.
 
     The Company appoints the Trustee as the initial conversion agent. The Trustee may resign from its appointment as conversion agent at any time and the Company shall then appoint a new conversion agent. The Trustee (or other conversion agent appointed by the Company) shall have no obligation to determine the Trading Price under Section 2.15(a)(iii) unless the Company has requested that the Trustee (or other conversion agent appointed by the Company) make such a determination. The Company shall have no obligation to make such request unless so requested in writing by a Holder that provides the Company with reasonable evidence that the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures would be less than 98% of the product of the Closing Sale Price per share of the Company's Common Stock and the Conversion Rate then in effect. If a Holder submits such a request, the Company shall instruct the Trustee (or other conversion agent) to determine the Trading Price of the Debentures beginning on the next Trading Day and on each successive Trading Day until the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures is greater than or equal to 98% of the product of the Closing Sale Price per share of the Common Stock and the Conversion Rate then in effect for five consecutive Trading Days.

Ex-Dividend Time
     (b) Whenever the Debentures shall become convertible pursuant to this Section 2.15, the Company or, at the Company's request, the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall notify the Holders of the event triggering such convertibility in the manner provided in Section 17.02 and Section 17.03 of the Base Indenture, and the Company shall also publicly announce such information and publish it on the Company's Internet site or otherwise publicly disclose it.
     (c) A Holder of Debentures is not entitled to any rights of a holder of Common Stock or Perpetual Preferred Stock until such Holder has converted his Debentures and received upon conversion thereof shares of Common Stock or perpetual Preferred Stock.
     To the extent that the cash, Perpetual Preferred Stock or Common Stock received by a Holder of Debentures upon the conversion of the Debentures is subject to U.S. withholding tax and such cash, Perpetual Preferred Stock or Common Stock is not sufficient to comply with the Company's U.S. withholding obligations with respect to these amounts, the Company may, to the extent required by law, recoup or set-off such liability against any payments subsequently made with respect to such Perpetual Preferred Stock or Common Stock, including, but not limited to, any actual cash dividends or distributions subsequently made with respect to such Perpetual Preferred Stock or Common Stock.

entitlement to interest thereon shall be carried out through that date in respect of the Debentures converted and upon that date the Holder will no longer be a Holder of such Debentures.
     (e) If the last Trading Day of the Conversion Reference Period applicable to conversion of any Debenture falls after a Regular Record Date but prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, interest thereon shall be payable to the holder of record on such Regular Record Date. However, any Debenture or portion thereof surrendered for conversion during the period from 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for any Interest Payment Date to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date shall be accompanied by payment, in immediately available funds or other funds acceptable to the Company, of an amount equal to the interest payable by the Company on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount being converted; no such payment need be made (1) if a Holder converts its Debentures in connection with a redemption and the Company has specified a Redemption Date that would, if it were the Conversion Date for any Debentures, result in the last Trading Day of the Conversion Reference Period for those Debentures falling after a Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, (2) if a Holder converts its Debentures in connection with a Non-Stock Change of Control and the final date upon which Debentures may be converted to qualify for receipt of the related Additional Shares would, if it were the Conversion Date for any Debentures, result in the last Trading Day of the Conversion Reference Period for those Debentures falling after a Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, (3) to the extent of any overdue or deferred interest, including any Compounded Interest, if any overdue or deferred interest exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Debenture or (4) if Holder converts its Debentures following the last Record Date prior to December 15, 2041. Except as otherwise provided herein, no payment or other adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of such Debenture hereunder. Accrued interest, if any, to the date of conversion not paid in cash is deemed to be paid in full with the Perpetual Preferred Stock, cash or shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion, rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. For purposes of this clause (e), all days that are, on any Conversion Date, scheduled to be Trading Days shall constitute Trading Days without regard to whether, due to a market disruption or otherwise, such days ultimately fail to meet the definition of "Trading Day" herein.
provided that
     Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Debenture, the Trustee (or other conversion agent appointed by the Company), or the Custodian at the direction of the Trustee (or other conversion agent appointed by the Company), shall make a notation on such Global Debenture as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversions of Debentures effected through any conversion agent other than the Trustee.
     In case any Debenture of a denomination greater than $1,000 shall be surrendered for partial conversion, and subject to Section 3.03 of the Base Indenture, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of the Debenture so surrendered, without charge to the Holder, a new Debenture or Debentures in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Debenture.
     Section 2.17 . No fractional shares of Common Stock or scrip certificates representing fractional shares shall be issued upon
Cash Payments in Lieu of Fractional Shares
 
conversion of Debentures. If more than one Debenture shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares that shall be issuable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted hereby) so surrendered. If any fractional share of stock would be issuable upon the conversion of any Debenture or Debentures, the Company shall make an adjustment and payment therefor in cash to the Holder of Debentures at a price equal to the Closing Sale Price on the last Trading Day immediately preceding the Conversion Date.
     Section 2.18 .
Conversion Rate
     (a) The Conversion Rate (the "") for the Debentures is 16.1421 shares of Common Stock per each $1,000 principal amount of the Debentures, subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 2.18.
Conversion Rate
     (b) In case the Company shall hereafter pay a dividend or make a distribution to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the date following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution by a fraction,
     (i) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution plus the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting such dividend or other distribution; and
     (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination,
such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purpose of this clause (b), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this clause (b) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     (c) In case the Company shall issue to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock rights or warrants entitling them (for a period expiring within 60 calendar days after the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Company's Common Stock on the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the date of the first public announcement of such issuance of rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall
 
equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants by a fraction,
     (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants plus the total number of additional shares of Common Stock offered for subscription or purchase, and
     (ii) the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants plus the number of shares that the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so offered would purchase at Current Market Price for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the first public announcement of the issuance of such rights or warrants.
     Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights or warrants are issued, and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants; that no adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made if the Holder shall otherwise participate in such distribution without conversion as a result of holding the Debentures. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than the Current Market Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Company's Board of Directors.
provided
     If the rights provided for in the Company's stockholder rights agreement dated July 24, 2002 or in any future rights plan adopted by the Company have separated from the shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable stockholder rights agreement so that the holders of the Debentures would not be entitled to receive any rights in respect of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Debentures, if any, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted as provided in Section 2.18(e).
     (d) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such subdivision or combination by a fraction,
 
     (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding after, and solely as a result of, such subdivision or combination, and
     (ii) the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding prior to such subdivision or combination,
such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective.
     (e) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock shares of any class of capital stock of the Company, assets (including shares of any Subsidiary or business unit of the Company), debt securities or rights to purchase the Company's securities (excluding any rights described in clause (c) above and any cash dividends or other cash distributions), then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be increased by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect on the Record Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction,
     (i) the numerator of which shall be the Current Market Price of the Company's Common Stock on such Record Date; and
     (ii) the denominator of which shall be the Current Market Price of the Company's Common Stock on such Record Date less the Fair Market Value (as determined by the Company's Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive, and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) on the Record Date of the portion of the distribution applicable to one share of Common Stock,
such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following such Record Date; that if the then Fair Market Value (as so determined) of the portion of the distribution applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on the Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount of assets such Holder would have received had such Holder converted each Debenture prior to the Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the Fair Market Value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 2.18(e) by reference to the actual or when-issued trading market for any securities, it must, in doing so, consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Current Market Price of one share of Common Stock on the applicable Record Date.
provided
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the dividend or distribution requiring an adjustment pursuant to this clause (e) consists of capital stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, then the Conversion Rate shall be increased by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect on the Record Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction,
 
     (i) the numerator of which shall be (x) the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Company's Common Stock for the 10 Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution on the NYSE or the principal U.S. stock exchange or interdealer quotation system on which the Company's Common Stock then listed or quoted, plus (y) the market value distributed per share of the Company's Common Stock based upon the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the security distributed for the 10 Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution on the NYSE or the principal U.S. stock exchange or interdealer quotation system on which such security is then listed or quoted and
     (ii) the denominator of which shall be the average of the Closing Sale Prices of the Company's Common Stock for the 10 Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth Trading Day after the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution on the NYSE or the principal U.S. stock exchange or interdealer quotation system on which Company's Common Stock is then listed or quoted.
     Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's capital stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (a ""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 2.18(e) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 2.18(e) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 2.18(e). If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Record Date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 2.18(e) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.
Trigger Event
 
     No adjustment of the Conversion Rate shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.18(e) in respect of rights or warrants distributed or deemed distributed on any Trigger Event to the extent that such rights or warrants are actually distributed, or reserved by the Company for distribution to Holders of the Debentures upon conversion by such Holders of Debentures to Common Stock, unless such rights or warrants have become separated from the Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the relevant agreement such that the Holders would not thereafter be entitled to receive such rights or warrants in respect of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Debentures. In such circumstances an adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made with respect to Debentures then outstanding pursuant to Section 2.18(e) (to the extent required thereby) upon the separation of the rights or warrants from the Common Stock.
     For purposes of this Section 2.18(e) and Sections 2.18(b) and (c), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 2.18(e) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 2.18(e) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Sections 2.18 (b) and (c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution", "the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants" and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Sections 2.18(b) and (c) and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 2.18(b).
     (f) In case the Company shall distribute to all or substantially all holders of its shares of Common Stock, cash (excluding (x) any distributions described in Section 2.18(g) or (y) any dividend or distribution in connection with the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding up), then the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect on the Trading Day immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution on the NYSE or the principal U.S. stock exchange or interdealer quotation system on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted by a fraction,
     (i) the numerator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on such date, less the Dividend Threshold Amount; and
     (ii) the denominator of which shall be equal to the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on such date, less the amount of the distribution per share of Common Stock,
such adjustment to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution, that if the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price of
provided
 
one share of Common Stock on the Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount of cash such Holder would have received had such Holder converted each Debenture prior to the Record Date. In the event that such distribution is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     (g) In case the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, at any time or from time to time, while any of the Debentures are outstanding, distribute cash or other consideration in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer made by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of the Common Stock of the Company, where the sum (such sum, the "aggregate amount" for purposes of this Section 2.18(g)) of the amount of such cash distributed and the Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and set forth in a Board Resolution), as of the expiration date of the tender offer or exchange offer (the last date on which shares of Common Stock can be tendered or exchanged), of such other consideration distributed, each per share of Common Stock purchased or exchanged, pursuant to such tender offer or exchange offer as of the expiration date of the tender offer or exchange offer (such purchased or exchanged shares of Common Stock, the "purchased shares" for purposes of this Section 2.18(g)) exceeds the Closing Sale Price per share of the Company's Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately following the expiration date of such tender offer or exchange offer, then, and in each case, immediately after the close of business on such date, the Conversion Rate shall be increased so that the same shall equal the rate determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Trading Day immediately following the expiration date of such tender offer or exchange offer by a fraction,
     (i) the numerator of which is equal to the sum of (A) the aggregate amount and (B) the product of (I) an amount equal to (1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the expiration date of the tender offer or exchange offer, less (2) the purchased shares and (II) the Closing Sale Price per share of the Company's Common Stock on the first Trading Day immediately following the expiration date of the tender offer or exchange offer; and
     (ii) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the expiration date of the tender offer or exchange offer (including all purchased shares) and (B) the Closing Sale Price per share of the Company's Common Stock on the first Trading Day immediately following the expiration date of the tender offer or exchange offer.
     An adjustment, if any, to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 2.18(g) shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the second Trading Day immediately following the expiration date of the tender offer or exchange offer. In the event that the Company or a Subsidiary is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender offer or exchange offer, but the Company or such Subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases, or all such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate which
 
would then be in effect if such tender offer or exchange offer had not been made. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if the application of this Section 2.18(g) to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this Section 2.18(g).
     (h) The Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by Section 2.18(b)-(g) as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.
     To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 Business Days, the increase is irrevocable during the period and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to Holders of record of the Debentures, with a copy to the Trustee, a notice of the increase, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it shall be in effect.
     (i) No adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) in such rate; provided that any adjustments that by reason of this Section 2.18(i) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and the Company shall make such carry-forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1%, within one year of the first such adjustment carry-forward, upon any redemption, upon a Change of Control or on the Final Maturity Date. All calculations under this Section 2.18 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock pursuant to a Company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest or for any issuance of Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities or rights to purchase Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities.
     (j) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any conversion agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which such adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the Holder of each Debenture at its last address appearing on the Security Register, within 20 calendar days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
 
     (k) In any case in which this Section 2.18 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after (1) a Record Date for an event, (2) the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive a dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 2.18(b), (3) a date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive rights or warrants pursuant to Section 2.18(c), or (4) the expiration time for any tender or exchange offer pursuant to Section 2.18(g), (each, an "adjustment determination date" for purposes of this Section 2.18(k)), the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of the applicable "adjustment event" (as hereinafter defined) (x) issuing to the Holder of any Debenture converted after such adjustment determination date and before the occurrence of such adjustment event, the additional shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such adjustment event over and above the cash and, if applicable, Common Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (y) paying to such Holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fractional shares. For purposes of this Section 2.18(k), the term "adjustment event" shall mean:
     (i) in any case referred to in clause (1) hereof, the occurrence of such event,
     (ii) in any case referred to in clause (2) hereof, the date any such dividend or distribution is paid or made,
     (iii) in any case referred to in clause (3) hereof, the date of expiration of such rights or warrants, and
     (iv) in any case referred to in clause (4) hereof, the date a sale or exchange of Common Stock pursuant to such tender or exchange offer is consummated and becomes irrevocable.
     (l) For purposes of this Section 2.18, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
     (m) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.18 if the Holders of the Debentures may participate in the transaction that would otherwise give rise to adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.18.
     (n) In respect of the settlement of any conversion in accordance with Section 2.23, all adjustments to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 2.18 shall be made for each day in the applicable Conversion Reference Period.
     Section 2.19
Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale.
     (a) In the event of:
     (i) any reclassification of the outstanding shares of Common Stock,
 
     (ii) any consolidation, merger, binding share exchange or combination of the Company with another Person, or
     (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company to any other Person
as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive capital stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, then the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture) providing for the conversion and settlement of Debentures as set forth in this Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments, which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in Section 2.18.
     (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.23, the Conversion Value in respect of any Debentures tendered for conversion on or after the 20th Trading Day immediately preceding the effective date of any such transaction shall be calculated in accordance with the definition of Conversion Value herein, except that for each of the Trading Days in the Conversion Reference Period on or after the effective date for such transaction, the relevant daily value will equal the daily value of the Exchange Property pertaining to such Debentures. For these purposes, "" means the kind and amount of shares of capital stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance by a holder of Common Stock holding, immediately prior to the transaction, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate (plus Additional Shares, to the extent that the holder is entitled to Additional Shares in accordance with Section 2.24 upon conversion) then in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent holders of our Common Stock are permitted to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the Exchange Property will be deemed for all purposes under this Section 2.19 to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election or, if a majority of holders that affirmatively make an election choose a single option, the types and amounts received by those majority electing holders.
Exchange Property
     (c) For the purpose of determining the value of any Exchange Property (""):
Exchange Property Value
     (i) Any shares of common stock of the successor or purchasing corporation or any other corporation that are included in the Exchange Property shall be valued as set forth in Section 2.23 as if such shares were "Common Stock" using the procedures set forth in the definition of "Closing Sale Price" in Section 1.1; and
     (ii) Any other property (other than cash) included in the Exchange Property shall be valued in good faith by the Board of Directors or by a NYSE member firm selected by the Board of Directors.
 
     (d) The Company shall in all cases deliver conversion consideration to Holders of Debentures converted as provided in Section 2.23, except that, in the case of any transaction described by Section 2.19(a) the effective date of which is on or before the last day of the Conversion Reference Period, instead of delivering any Net Shares otherwise deliverable under Section 2.23, the Company shall deliver an amount of Exchange Property that a holder of Common Stock holding, immediately prior to the transaction, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Net Shares would receive as a result of the transaction. If the Exchange Property includes more than one kind of property, the amount of Exchange Property of each kind to be delivered shall be in the proportion that the Exchange Property Value of such kind of Exchange Property bears to the Exchange Property Value of all the Exchange Property. If the foregoing calculations would require the Company to deliver a fractional share or unit of Exchange Property to a holder of Debentures being converted, the Company shall deliver cash in lieu of such fractional share or unit based on its Exchange Property Value.
     (e) The Company shall cause notice of the execution of the supplemental indenture referred to in Section 2.19(a) to be mailed to each holder of Debentures, at its address appearing on the Security Register provided for in Section 3.05 of the Base Indenture, within 20 calendar days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
     (f) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, combinations, sales and conveyances.
     (g) If this Section 2.19 applies to any event or occurrence, Section 2.18 shall not apply.
     Section 2.20 . The issue of stock certificates, if any, on conversion of Debentures shall be made without charge to the converting Holder for any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax in respect of the issue thereof. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of stock in any name other than that of the holder of any Debenture converted, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and until the Person or Persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.
Taxes on Shares Issued
     Section 2.21 . The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for the conversion of the Debentures as required by this Indenture from time to time as such Debentures are presented for conversion.
Reservation of Shares, Shares to be Fully Paid; Compliance with Governmental Requirements; Listing of Common Stock
     Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment increasing the Conversion Rate to an amount that would cause the Conversion Price to be reduced below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable, if any, upon conversion of the Debentures, the Company will take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in

     (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a Debenture (after giving effect to any Additional
 
Shares issuable pursuant to this Section 2.24) exceed 22.5988 per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures, subject to adjustment in the same manner and for the same events as the Conversion Rate may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.18.

Peabody Energy Corporation 701 Market Street, Suite 700 St. Louis, Missouri 93101
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          We have acted as counsel to Peabody Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), in connection with the preparation and filing by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") of a Registration Statement on Form S-3, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), as it became effective under the Act (the "Registration Statement"), with respect to the issuance and sale of $732,500,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 by the Corporation (the "Debentures") issued pursuant to the Subordinated Indenture, dated as of December 20, 2006, between the Corporation and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture, dated as of December 20, 2006 (the "Indenture"). The Debentures will be convertible, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Indenture, into a combination of cash or shares of perpetual preferred stock of the Corporation ("Perpetual Preferred Stock") and, under certain circumstances, common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Corporation. The Debentures will be offered for sale to investors pursuant to the Corporation's prospectus dated July 28, 2006, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement
 
December 20, 2006
dated December 14, 2006 (the "Prospectus"), filed by the Corporation pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act.
          In delivering this opinion letter, we have reviewed and relied upon: (i) the Registration Statement; (ii) the Prospectus; (iii) the Indenture; (iv) the Certificate of Designations of Perpetual Preferred Stock dated December 19, 2006; and (v) the global debentures representing the Debentures. We also have examined and relied upon originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such records of the Corporation and such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.
          In rendering the opinions described below, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. We also have assumed that the transactions related to the issuance of the Debentures will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the documents and forms of documents described herein.
          Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations stated herein and in the Prospectus constituting part of the Registration Statement, we are of the opinion that the statements set forth in the Prospectus constituting part of the Registration Statement under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income and Estate Tax Considerations," insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of matters of United States federal tax law and regulations or
 
December 20, 2006
legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute accurate summaries of the matters described therein in all material respects.
          We express no opinion with respect to the transactions referred to herein or in the Prospectus or the Registration Statement other than as expressly set forth herein. Moreover, we note that there is no authority directly on point dealing with securities such as the Debentures and that our opinion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or courts, any of which could take a contrary position. We do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the federal law of the United States.
          We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the Corporation's Form 8-K (which is deemed incorporated by reference into the Prospectus constituting part of the Registration Statement) and to the use of our name under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus.
