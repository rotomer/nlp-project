Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
Peabody Energy Corporation ("Peabody") announced on October 10, 2007, that its board of directors approved a spin-off of its wholly-owned subsidiary Patriot Coal Corporation ("Patriot"). The spin-off will be accomplished through a special dividend of all outstanding shares of Patriot to be issued to Peabody shareholders.
Peabody estimates that it will incur transaction costs in connection with the spin-off. Peabody has determined that at the time of this filing, it is unable in good faith to make a determination of the estimates required by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of Item 2.05 of the Form 8-K General Instructions. Peabody will file an amended report on Form 8-K within four business days of making a determination of the required estimates.
A copy of the press release relating to our announcement of the record date and expected distribution date for the spin-off is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.

He will continue to be employed by Peabody until the spin-off occurs. The Patriot spin-off is expected to occur on October 31, 2007.
On October 10, 2007, B. R. Brown stepped down from Peabody's board of directors, effective immediately. Mr. Brown joined the board of directors of Patriot effective as of October 12, 2007.

Amendments to Peabody benefit plans
The Board of Directors of Peabody approved amendments on October 10, 2007 (the "Amendments") to the following three Peabody plans: (1) the Peabody 2004 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan"); (2) the Peabody 2001 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the "2001 Plan"); and (3) the 1998 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of P&L Coal Holdings Corporation (the "1998 Plan" and, collectively with the 2001 Plan and the 2004 Plan, the "Plans").
The Plans, each of which authorizes the award of shares of Peabody common stock to Peabody employees, were amended to define the "fair market value" of Peabody's common stock and prohibit granting any stock options or stock appreciation rights under the Plans that have an exercise price that is below the fair market value of the underlying Peabody stock on the date of grant, as required to comply with final regulations promulgated under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
In addition, each of the Plans was amended with respect to certain awards held by Peabody employees who transfer directly to employment with Patriot following the spin-off of Patriot from Peabody (the "Patriot Employees"). The Plans were each amended to provide that the Patriot Employees' employment with Patriot following the spin-off will be treated as employment with Peabody for purposes of vesting and retirement eligibility with respect to awards under the Plans. For Patriot Employees who become Patriot senior management employees following the spin-off (excluding the Executive Advisor of Patriot), the Amendments provide that, (i) with respect to awards granted to such employees prior to 2006 under a Plan that are scheduled to vest on or before January 3, 2008, such employees' employment periods with Patriot will be treated as employment with Peabody for purposes of vesting and retirement eligibility under such awards, and (ii) with respect to awards granted to such employees prior to 2006 under a Plan that are scheduled to vest after January 3, 2008, such awards shall vest as of the effective date of the spin-off (and awards that are stock options shall cease to be exercisable and shall expire on July 3, 2008). All awards granted under the Plans held by Patriot Employees shall be immediately vested upon a Change in Control of Patriot, as defined in the Amendments.

Peabody also entered into an amendment to the 2004 Plan which provides that the spin-off of Patriot from Peabody shall not be considered or treated as a "Recapitalization Event" for purposes of the 2004 Plan.
Finally, the Board approved an amendment on October 10, 2007 to the Peabody Energy Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") that permits any Patriot Employee who is currently enrolled in the ESPP for the offering period ending December 31, 2007 to remain in the ESPP until the earliest to occur of (i) the end of the current offering period; (ii) such Patriot Employee's termination of employment with Patriot or (iii) three months from the date of the Patriot Employee's termination of employment with Peabody.
The above descriptions of the Amendments to the Plans and the ESPP are qualified in their entirety by reference to the texts of the Amendments, which are attached as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

WHEREAS

NOW, THEREFORE
     
1. Section 6 of the Plan is hereby amended by adding the following to the end thereof:
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, no SAR may be granted under this Plan that has an exercise price that is less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant.
     For purposes of this Plan, "Fair Market Value" means, as of any applicable date, (a) the closing sales price for one share of Common Stock on such date as reported on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the foregoing does not apply, on such other stock exchange on which the Corporation's Common Stock is then listed or admitted to trading, or on the last previous day on which a sale was reported if no sale of a share of Common Stock was reported on such date, or (b) if the foregoing subsection (a) does not apply, the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as reasonably determined in good faith by the Board in accordance with Code Section 409A. For purposes of subsection (b), the determination of such Fair Market Value by the Board will be made no less frequently
 
than every twelve (12) months and will either (x) use one of the safe harbor methodologies permitted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409-1(b)(iv)(B)(2) or (y) include, as applicable, the value of tangible and intangible assets of the Corporation, the present value of future cash flows of the Corporation, the market value of stock or other equity interests in similar corporations and other entities engaged in trades or businesses substantially similar to those engaged in by the Corporation, the value of which can be readily determined through objective means (such as through trading prices or an established securities market or an amount paid in an arms' length private transaction), and other relevant factors such as control premiums or discounts for lack of marketability and whether the valuation method is used for other purposes that have a material economic effect on the Corporation, its stockholders or its creditors.
     
2. Section 7 of the Plan is hereby amended to add the following to the end thereof:
     Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or the applicable Restricted Stock agreement to the contrary, employment with Patriot Coal Corporation or a subsidiary thereof ("Patriot") or with any successor (whether by merger, purchase or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the stock, assets or businesses of Patriot Coal Corporation (a "Successor") shall be treated as employment with the Corporation for the following purposes under the Plan:
     (a) Continued vesting of any Restricted Stock award held by a Patriot Employee (as defined below) that, immediately prior to such Patriot Employee's transfer to Patriot, is outstanding and unvested;
     (b) Continued vesting of any Restricted Stock award held by a Patriot Senior Management Employee (as defined below) that is scheduled to vest by January 3, 2008.
     Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or Restricted Stock agreement to the contrary, a Restricted Stock award held by a Patriot Senior Management Employee that is scheduled to vest later than January 3, 2008 shall be fully vested upon the effective date of the spin-off of Patriot ("Spin-Off Date").
     Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or Restricted Stock agreement to the contrary, a Restricted Stock award held by a Patriot Employee shall become fully vested upon a Patriot Change in Control (as such term is defined below).
     For purposes of the accelerated vesting provisions in the Restricted Stock agreement, the terms "Change of Control" and "Recapitalization Event" (if applicable) shall continue to have the meanings set forth in the Plan and shall apply only to the Corporation.
 
     For purposes of this Plan, a "Patriot Change in Control" means:

     (ii) during any period of twenty-four consecutive months (not including any period prior to November 1, 2007), individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board of Patriot, and any new director (other than (A) a director nominated by a Person who has entered into an agreement with Patriot to effect a transaction described in clause (i), (iii) or (iv) or (B) a director nominated by any Person (including Patriot) who publicly announces an intention to take or to consider taking actions (including, but not limited to, an actual or threatened proxy contest) which if consummated would constitute a Patriot Change in Control) whose election by the Patriot Board or nomination for election by Patriot's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least three-fourths (/) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof;

     (iv) the shareholders of Patriot approve a plan of complete liquidation of Patriot or the sale or disposition by Patriot of all or substantially all of Patriot's assets, other than a liquidation of Patriot into a wholly owned subsidiary.
     As used in this definition of Patriot Change in Control, "Person" (including a "group"), has the meaning as such term is used for purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (or any successor section thereto).

For purposes of the accelerated vesting provisions in the NQSO agreements held by a Patriot Employee or a Patriot Senior Management Employee, the terms "Change of Control" and "Recapitalization Event" (if applicable) shall continue to have the meanings set forth in the Plan and shall apply only to the Corporation.
 
     Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or NQSO agreement to the contrary, an NQSO award held by a Patriot Employee shall become fully vested upon a Patriot Change in Control.

The exercise price and tax withholding with respect to such exercise shall be paid by the withholding by the Corporation of such number of Shares acquired by the Participant upon such exercise of an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the exercise price plus the amount of any such tax withholding.

4. Section 11 of the Plan is hereby amended to add a new paragraph (e) to the end thereof that reads as follows:
     Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or the applicable Performance Unit agreement to the contrary, employment with Patriot or with any Successor shall be treated as employment with the Corporation for the continued vesting of any Performance Unit held by a Patriot Senior Management Employee that is scheduled to vest by January 3, 2008.
     A Performance Unit held by a Patriot Senior Management Employee that is scheduled to vest after January 3, 2008 shall become payable at its full value (without proration) based on the Corporation's actual performance results as of December 31, 2007. Such payment shall be made in the form of shares of Common Stock as soon as practicable after December 31, 2007, but no later than March 15, 2008.
     
5. Section 17 of the Plan is hereby amended to add a new paragraph (p) to the end thereof that reads as follows:
(p) To the extent applicable and notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, this Plan and Awards hereunder shall be administered, operated and interpreted in accordance with Code Section 409A and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the date on which the Board approves the Plan; , in the event that the Administrator determines that any amounts payable hereunder may be taxable to a Participant under Code Section 409A and related Department of Treasury guidance prior to the payment and/or delivery to such Participant of such amount, the Corporation may (i) adopt such amendments to the Plan and related Award, and appropriate policies and procedures, including amendments and policies with retroactive effect, that the Administrator determines necessary or appropriate to preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided by the Plan and Awards hereunder and/or (ii) take such other actions as the Administrator determines necessary or
provided, however
 
appropriate to comply with or exempt the Plan and/or Awards from the requirements of Code Section 409A and related Department of Treasury guidance, including such Department of Treasury guidance and other interpretive materials as may be issued after the date on which the Board approves the Plan. The Corporation makes no guarantees to any Participant regarding the tax treatment of Awards or payments made under the Plan, and, notwithstanding the above provisions and any agreement or understanding to the contrary, if any Award, payments or other amounts due to a Participant (or his or her beneficiaries, as applicable) results in, or causes in any manner, the application of an accelerated or additional tax, fine or penalty under Code Section 409A or otherwise to be imposed, then the Participant (or his or her beneficiaries, as applicable) shall be solely liable for the payment of, and the Corporation and its subsidiaries shall have no obligation or liability to pay or reimburse (either directly or otherwise) the Participant (or his or her beneficiaries, as applicable) for, any such additional taxes, fines or penalties.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PEABODY ENERGY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS
APPROVES SPIN-OFF OF PATRIOT COAL CORPORATION
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 10  Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) today announced that its board of directors has approved a spin-off of coal assets and operations in West Virginia and Kentucky to BTU shareholders. The spin-off will be accomplished through a special dividend of all outstanding shares of Patriot Coal Corporation, which would then be an independent public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PCX.
     Distribution of Patriot stock to Peabody Energy shareholders is expected to occur on October 31, at a ratio of one share of Patriot Coal stock for every 10 shares of Peabody held. Those holding Peabody shares up to the market close on the distribution date will be entitled to receive the Patriot distribution.* The record date is October 22, and "when issued" trading is expected to begin several days prior to the record date. Refer to PeabodyEnergy.com for more details regarding the distribution.
     The planned distribution has received a favorable tax-free ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. The distribution is conditioned upon Patriot's registration statement on Form 10 being declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission along with other conditions outlined in the information statement filed with the SEC.
     "We believe this spin-off unlocks long-term value for shareholders, who will retain ownership in the world's largest coal company and obtain ownership in a leading Eastern U.S. producer with a major metallurgical and steam coal position," said Peabody Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gregory H. Boyce. "With this spin-off, both companies are able to pursue their distinct growth plans and business focus. Peabody continues the planned transformation of our earnings base as we expand our global operating platform, increase our presence in the Western United States and Illinois Basin, accelerate our worldwide trading activities and participate in Btu Conversion."
