Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Peabody Energy Corporation ("Peabody") approved amendments on December 5, 2007 (the "Amendments") to the following two Peabody plans: (1) the Peabody 2004 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan"); and (2) the 1998 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of P&L Coal Holdings Corporation (the "1998 Plan" and, collectively with the 2004 Plan, the "Plans"). The Amendments were entered into on December 7, 2007. As described below, the Amendments are made to correct prior amendments to the Plans, approved on October 10, 2007 (the "Prior Amendments"), which did not accurately reflect the intent of Peabody and Patriot Coal Corporation ("Patriot"), a former subsidiary of Peabody that spun off from Peabody on October 31, 2007.
The Prior Amendments were made with respect to certain awards held by select Peabody employees who terminated their employment with Peabody in connection with the spin-off of Patriot. Under the Prior Amendments, options that were (1) held by these select Peabody employees who became senior management employees of Patriot following the spin-off (excluding the Senior Advisor of Patriot), (2) granted prior to 2006 and (3) scheduled to vest after January 3, 2008 (the "Accelerated Options"), became fully vested and were deemed to be exercised as of the date of the spin-off of Patriot. The Prior Amendments provided that the deemed exercise date for the Accelerated Options was the spin-off date of Patriot. The intent of the Prior Amendments was to have the Accelerated Options reflect the adjustment that would be made with respect to all outstanding options to purchase Peabody common stock for the spin-off of Patriot on the day following the spin-off of Patriot. The use of the spin-off date did not provide the intended result, because Peabody needed to use the opening price of its common stock on the day following the spin-off of Patriot in order to make this adjustment. The Amendments correct this unintended result by providing that the Accelerated Options are deemed to be exercised on the day immediately following the spin-off of Patriot. The Amendments allow the administrator for the Plans to use the opening sales price of Peabody common stock on the day following the spin-off in order to accurately reflect the adjustment intended to be made to the Accelerated Options with respect to the spin-off of Patriot.
The above descriptions of the Amendments to the 2004 Plan and the 1998 Plan are qualified in their entirety by reference to the texts of the Amendments, which are attached as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 hereto, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.

EXHIBIT 10.1
     , Peabody Energy Corporation (the "Company") adopted and maintains the Peabody Energy Corporation 2004 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the "Plan"), and all capitalized terms used but not defined herein are defined in the Plan;
WHEREAS
     , pursuant to Section 16 of the Plan, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has the right to amend the Plan and (ii) the Administrator may amend the terms of outstanding awards under the Plan without the Participant's consent, so long as such amendment does not adversely affect the Participant's rights under the award; and
WHEREAS
     , the Company spun off a portion of its business effective October 31, 2007 to Patriot Coal Corporation ("Patriot"), resulting in the transfer of certain Company employees to employment with Patriot and constituting a termination of employment for such employees for purposes of their outstanding grants under the Plan;
WHEREAS
     , the Board previously approved Amendment No. 3 to the Plan (the "Third Amendment") to allow for accelerated vesting and the deemed exercise of the Accelerated Options held by Patriot Senior Management Employees on the Spin-Off Date;
WHEREAS
     , the Board intended to pay full value for such Accelerated Options upon their exercise by adjusting the shares of Common Stock ("Peabody Stock") subject to such Accelerated Options to reflect the spin-off of Patriot, as is the case for all options outstanding under the Plan immediately after the Spin-Off Date;
WHEREAS
     the Board has determined that the Peabody Stock subject to the Accelerated Options will not be entitled to receive the distribution of Patriot common stock on the Spin-Off Date, because the Accelerated Options were not exercised and, thus the Peabody Stock was not owned, as of the applicable record date preceding the Spin-Off Date,
WHEREAS,
     , the Board has further determined that the Third Amendment mistakenly specifies the deemed exercise date as the Spin-Off Date, which is the day prior to the date that such Accelerated Options could be adjusted to reflect the spin-off of Patriot, as such adjustment requires the use of the opening sales price of Peabody Stock on the day immediately following the Spin-Off Date;
WHEREAS
     , the Board desires to amend the Plan to correct this unintended result and to have the Accelerated Options be deemed to be exercised on the day immediately following the Spin-Off Date, and to use the opening sales price of Peabody Stock on such date in order to accurately reflect the adjustment intended to be made to the Accelerated Options with respect to the spin-off of Patriot.
WHEREAS
 
          , the Plan is hereby amended effective as of October 31, 2007 as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
     
1. The second to last paragraph of Section 9 of the Plan is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:
     Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or any NQSO agreement to the contrary, each Accelerated Option (as defined below) shall vest on the Spin-Off Date and be deemed to be exercised on the day immediately following the Spin-Off Date. The exercise price and tax withholding with respect to such exercise shall be paid by the withholding by the Corporation of such number of shares of Common Stock acquired by the Participant upon such exercise of an aggregate fair market value equal to the exercise price plus the amount of any such tax withholding. For purposes of this paragraph and notwithstanding Section 6 of the Plan, the fair market value of a share of Common Stock shall equal the opening sales price of one share of Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the day immediately following the Spin-Off Date.
     
2. In all other respects, the Plan shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

 
EXHIBIT 10.2
     , Peabody Energy Corporation (the "Company") maintains the 1998 Stock Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees of P&L Coal Holdings Corporation (the "Plan"), and all capitalized terms used but not defined herein are defined in the Plan;
WHEREAS
     , pursuant to Section 10 of the Plan, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has the right to amend the Plan and (ii) the Compensation Committee of the Company may amend the terms and conditions of outstanding grants under the Plan if such amendment does not adversely affect the Participant's rights without his or her consent; and
WHEREAS
     , the Company spun off a portion of its business effective October 31, 2007 to Patriot Coal Corporation ("Patriot"), resulting in the transfer of certain Company employees to employment with Patriot and constituting a termination of employment for such employees for purposes of their outstanding grants under the Plan;
WHEREAS
     , the Board previously approved the Amendment to the Plan (the "First Amendment") to allow for accelerated vesting and the deemed exercise of the Accelerated Options held by Patriot Senior Management Employees on the Spin-Off Date;
WHEREAS
     , the Board intended to pay full value for such Accelerated Options upon their exercise by adjusting the shares of Common Stock ("Peabody Stock") subject to such Accelerated Options to reflect the spin-off of Patriot, as is the case for all options outstanding under the Plan immediately after the Spin-Off Date;
WHEREAS
     the Board has determined that the Peabody Stock subject to the Accelerated Options will not be entitled to receive the distribution of Patriot common stock on the Spin-Off Date, because the Accelerated Options were not exercised and, thus the Peabody Stock was not owned, as of the applicable record date preceding the Spin-Off Date,
WHEREAS,
     , the Board has further determined that the First Amendment mistakenly specifies the deemed exercise date as the Spin-Off Date, which is the day prior to the date that such Accelerated Options could be adjusted to reflect the spin-off of Patriot, as such adjustment requires the use of the opening sales price of Peabody Stock on the day immediately following the Spin-Off Date;
WHEREAS
     , the Board desires to amend the Plan to correct this unintended result and to have the Accelerated Options be deemed to be exercised on the day immediately following the Spin-Off Date, and to use the opening sales price of Peabody Stock on such date in order to accurately reflect the adjustment intended to be made to the Accelerated Options with respect to the spin-off of Patriot.
WHEREAS
 
          , the Plan is hereby amended effective as of October 31, 2007 as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
     
1. The seventh full paragraph of Section 
5(a)(ii)
of the Plan is hereby deleted in its entirety, and for the avoidance of doubt, such paragraph prior to this amendment read as follows:
     Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or any Grant Agreement to the contrary, each Accelerated Option (as defined below) shall vest and be deemed to be exercised on the effective date of the spin-off of Patriot ("Spin-Off Date"). The exercise price and tax withholding with respect to such exercise shall be paid by the withholding by the Company of such number of Shares acquired by the Participant upon such exercise of an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the exercise price plus the amount of any such tax withholding.
and such paragraph of Section 
5(a)(ii)
of the Plan is hereby replaced with the following:
     Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or any Grant Agreement to the contrary, each Accelerated Option (as defined below) shall vest on the effective date of the spin-off of Patriot (the "Spin-Off Date") and be deemed to be exercised on the day immediately following the Spin-Off Date. The exercise price and tax withholding with respect to such exercise shall be paid by the withholding by the Company of such number of Shares acquired by the Participant upon such exercise of an aggregate fair market value equal to the exercise price plus the amount of any such tax withholding. For purposes of this paragraph and notwithstanding Section 2(k) of the Plan, the fair market value of a Share shall equal the opening sales price of one Share as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the day immediately following the Spin-Off Date.
     
2. In all other respects, the Plan shall remain unchanged and in full force and effect.
