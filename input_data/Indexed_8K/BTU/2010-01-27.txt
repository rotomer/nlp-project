Item 1.01. Entry Into A Definitive Material Agreement.
Peabody Energy Corporation ("Peabody") has an accounts receivable securitization program through its wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary, P&L Receivables Company, LLC ("Seller"). Under the program, Peabody contributes a pool of eligible trade receivables to the Seller, which then sells, without recourse, to a multi-seller, asset-backed commercial paper conduit. Purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. Prior to January 25, 2010, Market Street Funding LLC was the sole conduit purchaser under the program.
On January 25, 2010, the receivables purchase agreement for the program was amended and restated (a) in order to add Calyon New York Branch as a related committed purchaser, as an LC participant and as a purchaser agent, (b) in order to add Atlantic Asset Securitization LLC as a conduit purchaser, (c) to reflect the release of Peabody COALTRADE International (CTI), LLC as an originator of receivables, and (d) to make certain other changes contained in the exhibit referenced below.
The foregoing description is only a summary of certain provisions of the amended and restated receivables purchase agreement, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amended and restated receivables purchase agreement itself, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and which is incorporated by reference herein.
