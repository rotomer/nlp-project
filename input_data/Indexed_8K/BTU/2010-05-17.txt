Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Peabody Energy Corporation ("Peabody") has an accounts receivable securitization program through its wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary, P&L Receivables Company, LLC ("Seller"). Under the program, Peabody contributes, on a revolving basis, trade receivables of most of its U.S. subsidiaries to the Seller, which then sells the receivables in their entirety to a consortium of unaffiliated asset-backed commercial paper conduits (the "Conduits"). Purchases by the Conduits are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. On May 11, 2010, the program was amended to extend its regularly scheduled expiration date by one year to May 10, 2011 and to make certain other changes. The foregoing description is only a summary of certain provisions of the amendment, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the amendment itself, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and which is incorporated by reference herein.
