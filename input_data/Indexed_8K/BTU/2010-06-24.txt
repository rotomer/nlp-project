Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Credit Agreement
     On June 18, 2010, Peabody Energy Corporation (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, entered into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer, and Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers, and the lenders named therein. The Credit Agreement replaces the Company's third amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of September 15, 2006, by and among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer, Banc of America Securities LLC and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., each as a joint lead arranger and joint book manager, Citibank, N.A., as syndication agent, BNP Paribas, Calyon, and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, each as a co-documentation agent, and the lenders party thereto (the "Old Credit Agreement").
     The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, of which up to $350.0 million will be available to our Dutch subsidiary, Peabody Holland B.V., upon certain conditions being met, and a $500.0 million term loan facility. The revolving credit facility commitment and the term loans under the senior unsecured credit facility will mature five years from the date of the execution of the Credit Agreement.
     All borrowings under the Credit Agreement (other than swingline borrowings and borrowings denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars) bear interest, at our option, at either: (a) a "base rate" equal to the higher of: (i) 0.50% per year above the overnight federal funds effective rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as in effect from time to time, (ii) the annual rate of interest in effect for that day as publicly announced by the administrative agent under the senior unsecured credit facility as its "prime rate" and (iii) the one-month "eurocurrency rate" plus 1.0% or (b) a "eurocurrency rate" equal to the rate (adjusted for reserve requirements, deposit insurance assessment rates and other regulatory costs for eurocurrency liabilities) at which eurocurrency deposits in the relevant currency for the relevant interest period (which will be one, two, three or six months or, subject to availability, one or two weeks or nine or twelve months, as selected by us) are offered in the interbank eurodollar market, plus in each case a rate, dependent on the ratio of our debt as compared to our adjusted consolidated EBITDA, ranging from 2.50% to 1.25% per year for borrowings bearing interest at the "base rate" and from 3.50% to 2.25% per year for borrowings bearing interest at the "eurocurrency rate" (such rate added to the "eurocurrency rate," the "Eurocurrency Margin"). Swingline borrowings bear interest at a "BBA LIBOR" rate equal to the rate (adjusted for reserve requirements, deposit insurance assessment rates and other regulatory costs at the discretion of the administrative agent) at which deposits in the relevant currency for a one month term are offered in the interbank eurodollar market, as determined by the administrative agent, plus the Eurocurrency Margin. Borrowings denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars will bear interest at the "eurocurrency rate" plus the Eurocurrency Margin.
     We pay a usage-dependent commitment fee under the revolving credit facility, which is dependent upon the ratio of our debt compared to our adjusted consolidated EBITDA and ranges
 
2
from 0.375% to 0.500% of the available unused commitment. Swingline loans will not be considered usage of the revolving credit facility for purposes of calculating the commitment fee. The fee will accrue quarterly in arrears.
     In addition, we pay a letter of credit fee calculated at a rate dependent on the ratio of our debt as compared to our adjusted consolidated EBITDA, ranging from 3.50% to 2.25% per year of the undrawn amount of each letter of credit and a fronting fee equal to 0.125% per year of the face amount drawn under each letter of credit. These fees are payable quarterly in arrears on the first business day of each March, June, September and December and we also pay customary transaction charges in connection with any letters of credit.
     The $500.0 million term loan facility will be subject to quarterly amortization of 1.25% per quarter commencing six months after the execution of the Credit Agreement, with the final payment of all amounts outstanding (including accrued interest) being due five years from the date of the execution of the Credit Agreement.
     The Credit Agreement imposes certain restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to: incur or suffer to exist debt or provide guarantees; grant or suffer to exist liens; enter into agreements with negative pledge clauses; pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of capital stock; make loans, investments, advances and acquisitions; sell our assets; make redemptions and repurchases of capital stock or otherwise return capital; liquidate or dissolve; engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in affiliate transactions; change our business; and restrict distributions from subsidiaries. It also provides for minimum interest coverage ratios, maximum leverage ratios and customary events of default.
     If an event of default under our Credit Agreement occurs and is continuing, the commitments thereunder may be terminated and the principal amount outstanding thereunder, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts owed thereunder, may be declared immediately due and payable and any letters of credit outstanding may be required to be cash collateralized.
     Our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries will guarantee all loans under the Credit Agreement. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries also, to the extent permitted by applicable law and existing contractual obligations, will guarantee loans made to our Dutch subsidiary.
     Our obligations under the Credit Agreement will be unsecured.
     Certain of the lenders and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us and our affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions.
     The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by this reference.

Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
     In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, on June 18, 2010 we terminated the Old Credit Agreement, which provided for a $1.8 billion revolving credit facility and a $950.0 million term loan facility. Proceeds from the Credit Agreement were used to repay in full all amounts outstanding under the Old Credit Agreement.

Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the applicable Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

For the purposes hereof "demand" shall include the commencement and continuance of any legal proceedings.

Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent    under the Credit Agreement, as hereinafter    defined (the "Administrative Agent")
and
The Lenders listed on Schedule I hereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          We have acted as counsel to the Company and the subsidiaries of the Company named on Schedule II attached hereto (each, a "Subsidiary Guarantor" and, collectively, the "Subsidiary Guarantors"; the Borrowers and the Subsidiary Guarantors being referred to herein collectively as the "Loan Parties") in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the following documents:
          (a) the Credit Agreement;
          (b) the Notes dated the date hereof delivered to the Lenders; and
          (c) the US Subsidiary Guaranty.
 
The documents described in the foregoing clauses (a) through (c) are collectively referred to herein as the "Loan Documents." Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement. This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(v) of the Credit Agreement.
          In connection with this opinion, we have examined:
In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing, and upon originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Loan Parties, and have made such other investigations as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth. In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to certain matters of fact upon the representations made in the Loan Documents.
          Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
          1. Each of the Loan Parties (other than the Loan Parties listed on Schedule III hereto (the "")) (a) is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, (b) has the corporate, limited liability or limited partnership power and authority to execute and deliver each of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to borrow and perform its obligations thereunder and (c) has duly authorized, executed and delivered each Loan Document to which it is a party.
Non-Delaware Loan Parties
          2. Assuming that proceeds of borrowings will be used in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the execution and delivery by each Loan Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party, borrowings by the Borrowers in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and performance by each Loan Party of its payment obligations under the Loan Documents to which such Loan Party is a party (a) do not and will not result in any violation of any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Delaware Limited Liability Act or the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act or any rule or regulation issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Delaware Limited Liability Act or the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act or any order known to us issued by any court or governmental agency or body and (b) will not breach or result in a default under or result in the creation of any lien upon or security interest in the property of any Loan Party pursuant to the terms of any agreement identified on Schedule IV hereto.
          3. No consent, approval, authorization, order, filing, registration or qualification of or with any federal or New York governmental agency or body or any Delaware governmental agency or body acting pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act or the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act is required for the execution and delivery by any Loan Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party or the performance by any Loan Party of its payment obligations under the Loan Documents to which such Loan Party is a party.
          4. Assuming that each of the Loan Documents is a valid and legally binding obligation of each of the parties thereto other than the Loan Parties and assuming that (a) each of the Non-Delaware Loan Parties is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has duly authorized, executed and delivered the Loan Documents to which it is a party in accordance with its organizational documents, (b) the execution, delivery and performance by each Loan Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party do not violate the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or any other applicable laws (excepting the law of the State of New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act and the federal laws of the United States) and (c) the execution, delivery and performance by each Loan Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party do not constitute a breach or violation of any agreement or instrument which is binding upon such Loan Party (except that we do not make the assumption in the foregoing clause (c) with respect to the agreements that are the subject of opinion paragraph 2 of this letter), each Loan Document constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of each Loan Party which is a party thereto, enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance with its terms.
 
          5. To our knowledge, there is no action, suit or proceeding now pending before or by any court, arbitrator or governmental agency, body or official to which the Company is a party or to which the business, assets or property of the Company is subject, and no such action, suit or proceeding is threatened to which the Company or the business, assets or property of the Company would be subject, that in either case questions the validity of the Loan Documents.
          6. Neither of the Borrowers nor any Subsidiary Guarantor is an "investment company" within the meaning of, and subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
          7. Assuming that the Borrowers will comply with the provisions of the Credit Agreement relating to the use of proceeds, the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement by the Company and the making of the Loans under the Credit Agreement will not violate Regulation T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
          Our opinion in paragraph 4 above is subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and (iv) the effects of the possible judicial application of foreign laws or foreign governmental or judicial action affecting creditors' rights.
          We note that (A) a New York statute provides that with respect to a foreign currency obligation a court of the State of New York shall render a judgment or decree in such foreign currency and such judgment or decree shall be converted into currency of the United States at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of entry of such judgment or decree and (B) with respect to a foreign currency obligation a United States federal court in New York may award judgment in United States dollars, provided that we express no opinion as to the rate of exchange such court would apply.
          We express no opinion with respect to:
     (A) any matters subject to the Coal Act or the Black Lung Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder;
 
     (B) the effect of any provision of the Loan Documents which is intended to permit modification thereof only by means of an agreement in writing signed by the parties thereto;
     (C) the effect of any provision of the Loan Documents insofar as it provides that any Person purchasing a participation from a Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Lender or other Person may exercise set-off or similar rights other than in accordance with applicable law;
     (D) the effect of any provision of the Loan Documents imposing penalties or forfeitures;
     (E) the enforceability of any provision of the Loan Documents to the extent that such provision constitutes a waiver of illegality as a defense to performance of contract obligations; and
     (F) the effect of any provision of the Loan Documents relating to indemnification or exculpation in connection with violations of any securities laws or relating to indemnification, contribution or exculpation in connection with willful, reckless or criminal acts or gross negligence of the indemnified or exculpated Person or the Person receiving contribution.
          In connection with the provisions of the Loan Documents whereby any Loan Party submits to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, we note the limitations of 28 U.S.C.  1331 and 1332 on subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts. In connection with the provisions of the Loan Documents which relate to forum selection (including, without limitation, any waiver of any objection to venue or any objection that a court is an inconvenient forum), we note that under NYCPLR  510 a New York state court may have discretion to transfer the place of trial, and under 28 U.S.C.  1404(a) a United States district court has discretion to transfer an action from one federal court to another.
          With respect to certain matters of Dutch law, we understand that you are relying on the opinion of Baker McKenzie Amsterdam N.V. dated the date hereof.
          With respect to certain matters of Illinois law, we understand that you are relying on the opinion of Thompson Coburn LLP dated the date hereof.
 
          With respect to certain matters of Indiana law, we understand that you are relying on the opinion of Ziemer, Stayman, Weitzel & Shoulders, LLP, dated the date hereof.
          With respect to certain matters with respect to the Loan Parties, we understand that you are relying on the opinion of Kenneth L. Wagner, Vice President, Assistant General Counsel and Assistant Secretary of the Company, dated the date hereof.
          We do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of New York, the federal law of the United States, the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act and the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act.
          This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the above described transactions. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by, or furnished to, any other person, firm or corporation without our prior written consent.
Very truly yours,

Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent      under the Credit Agreement, as hereinafter      defined (the "Administrative Agent")
and
The Lenders listed on Schedule I hereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am Vice President, Assistant General Counsel and Assistant Secretary of the Company. I have supervised the corporate proceedings of the Company and each of the subsidiaries of the Company named on Schedule II attached hereto (each, a "Subsidiary Guarantor" and, collectively, the "Subsidiary Guarantors"; the Borrowers and the Subsidiary Guarantors being referred to herein collectively as the "Loan Parties"), in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the following documents:
The documents described in the foregoing clauses (a) through (c) are collectively referred to herein as the "Loan Documents." Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement. This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(vi) of the Credit Agreement.
 
June 18, 2010
In connection with this opinion, I have examined:
In addition, I have also examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing, and upon the originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Loan Parties, and have made such other investigations as I have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth.
I have assumed in rendering the opinion set forth below: (a) that the Loan Documents have been duly authorized by each party thereto and that the Loan Documents have been validly executed and delivered by and are the valid and binding obligation of each party thereto enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms; (b) that the execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement by each party thereto other than the Company does not contravene or conflict with such party's articles of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents or contravene or conflict with any law or regulation binding upon such party; (c) that each party to the Loan Documents has acted in good faith in executing and delivering the Loan Documents; (d) that the Loan Documents and the Other Agreement (as defined below) would be enforced as written; (e) that the Loan Parties will not in the future take any discretionary action (including a decision not to act) permitted under the Loan Documents that would constitute a breach or default under the Other Agreement; and (f) that all parties to the Loan Documents will act in accordance with, and refrain from taking any action that is forbidden by, the terms and conditions of the Other Agreement. For purposes of this opinion letter, "Other Agreement" means the Second Amended and Restated Receivables Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 15, 2009, by and among P&L Receivables Company, LLC, the Company, the sub-servicers named therein, Market Street Funding LLC, the LC Participants named therein and PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrator and as LC Bank.
Additionally, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as duplicates or certified or conformed copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. As to questions of fact material to this opinion, I have relied upon certificates of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Loan Parties. In addition, I have examined, and have relied as to certain matters of fact upon, the representations made in the Loan Documents.
When a statement herein is qualified by the phrase "to my knowledge", it is intended to indicate that no information that would give current actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement has come to my attention.
 
June 18, 2010
I am a member of the Bar of the State of Missouri and, accordingly, I express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Missouri and the federal laws of the United States of America, each as currently in effect.
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications, exceptions and assumptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that the execution and delivery by each Loan Party of the Loan Documents to which it is a party, borrowings by the Borrowers in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and performance of their payment obligations thereunder will not breach or result in a default under or result in the creation of any lien upon or security interest in the Loan Parties' properties pursuant to the terms of the Other Agreement.
In addition, I advise you that to my knowledge there are no legal actions, suits or proceedings pending or overtly threatened in writing, in arbitration or before any court or other governmental authority, that name any Loan Party and are specifically directed to any Loan Party or its property (a) that question the validity of the Loan Documents or (b) other than as described in the Company's reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that, so far as the Company can now foresee considering their probability of success, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the above described transactions. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by, or furnished to, any other person, firm or corporation without my prior written consent. At your request, I hereby consent to reliance hereon by any future assignee of your interest in the loans under the Credit Agreement pursuant to an assignment that is made and consented to (to the extent required) in accordance with the express provisions of Section 10.6 of the Credit Agreement, on the condition and understanding that (i) this letter speaks only as of the date hereof, (ii) I have no responsibility or obligation to update this letter, to consider its applicability or correctness to other than its addressees, or to take into account changes in law, facts or any other developments of which I may later become aware, (iii) any such reliance by a future assignee must be actual and reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time of assignment, including any changes in law, facts or any other developments known to or reasonably knowable by the assignee at such time and (iv) I may revoke my consent to such reliance at any time by notice to the Lenders then party to the Credit Agreement, so long as such notice is accompanied by a replacement opinion letter addressing the matters covered in this opinion letter in a manner reasonably satisfactory to such Lenders.
