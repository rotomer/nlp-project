The Company will pay interest on the Notes on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2011. The Notes will mature on September 15, 2020 and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time under the terms provided in the indenture and supplemental indenture under which they will be issued.

The Company plans to use the net proceeds to purchase any and all of its outstanding 6 7/8% notes due 2013 Notes (the "2013 Notes") in the tender offer previously announced and to pay any fees and expenses related to the tender offer. Any proceeds not used to purchase the 2013 Notes will be used to redeem all 2013 Notes that are not tendered in the tender offer.

The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement is qualified by reference to the agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1 and incorporated herein by this reference.

     (b) Each Underwriter shall, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, their respective officers, each of their respective directors, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, or any action in respect thereof, to which the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any such director, officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action arises out of, or is based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information concerning such Underwriter furnished to the Company through the Representative by or on behalf of that Underwriter specifically for inclusion therein, which information consists solely of the information specified in Section 8(e), and shall reimburse the Company and any such director, officer or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have to the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or any such director, officer, employee or controlling person.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 8 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 8. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that the Representative shall have the right to employ one
 
counsel to represent jointly the Underwriters and their respective directors, officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company under this Section 8 if, in the reasonable judgment of the Representative, it is advisable for the Underwriters, directors, officers, employees and controlling persons to be jointly represented by such counsel, and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company. No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not include any findings of fact or admissions of fault or culpability as to the indemnified party or (ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities purchased under this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, on the one hand, and the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters with respect to the Securities purchased under this Agreement, on the other hand, bear to the total gross proceeds from the offering of the Securities under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this Section 8 were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such
 
purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 8 shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section 8(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes purchased by it was resold to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 8(d) are several in proportion to their respective Purchase obligations and not joint.
     (e) The Underwriters severally confirm and the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors acknowledge that the names of the Underwriters set forth on the cover page of, and the names of the underwriters appearing in the table on page S-48, the first sentence of the paragraph under the heading "Commissions and Discounts" on page S-48, the third sentence of the paragraph under the heading "New Issue of Notes" on page S-49 and the first two paragraphs under the heading "Short Positions" on page S-49 of, the Prospectus are correct and constitute the only information concerning such Underwriters furnished in writing to the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors by or on behalf of the Underwriters specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus.
     SECTION 9. .
Defaulting Underwriters
     If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated to purchase the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such Closing Date; that the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any of the Notes on such Closing Date if the total amount of the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such date exceeds 9.09% of the total amount of Notes to be purchased on such Closing Date, and the non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the amount of Notes which they agreed to purchase on such Closing Date pursuant to the terms of Section 3. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other Underwriters satisfactory to the Representative who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to purchase, all of the Notes to be purchased on such Closing Date. If the non-defaulting Underwriters do not elect to purchase the Notes which the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase on such Closing Date, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses to the extent set forth in Sections 6 and 11. As used in this Agreement, the term "" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context requires otherwise, any party not listed in Schedule II hereto who, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases the Notes which a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
provided, however,
Underwriter
 
     Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors for damages caused by its default. If the non-defaulting Underwriter is obligated or agrees to purchase the Notes of the defaulting or withdrawing Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Prospectus, in the Time of Sale Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement.
     SECTION 10. . The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be terminated by the Representative by notice given to and received by the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Notes if, prior to that time, any of the events described in Sections 7(k), 7(l) and (m) shall have occurred or if the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the Notes for any reason permitted under this Agreement.
Termination
     SECTION 11. . If the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall fail to deliver the Securities to the Underwriters by reason of any failure, refusal or inability on the part of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors to perform any agreement on its part to be performed, or because any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder required to be fulfilled by the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors is not fulfilled, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will reimburse the Underwriters for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of the Securities, and upon demand the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall pay the full amount thereof to the Representative.
