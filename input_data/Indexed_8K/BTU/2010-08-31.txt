Item 8.01 Other Events.
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act") was enacted. Section 1503 of the Act requires a Current Report on Form 8-K if a company is issued an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the "Mine Act") by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA"). On August 25, 2010, two contractor employees working at Peabody Western Coal Company ("PWCC", a subsidiary of Peabody Energy Corporation), were cited by MSHA for violating fall protection rules. The citations were immediately corrected and promptly terminated. MSHA also issued PWCC an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act, which was also promptly terminated. PWCC intends to vigorously contest the issuance of the order because the contractor is the responsible party in this matter.
