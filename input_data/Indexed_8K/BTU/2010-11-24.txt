Item 8.01 Other Events.
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act") was enacted. Section 1503 of the Act contains new reporting requirements regarding mine safety, including disclosing on a Current Report on Form 8-K the receipt of written notice from the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA") that a coal or other mine of which the issuer or a subsidiary is an operator has a pattern or potential pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards under section 104(e) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the "Mine Act"). On November 19, 2010, Peabody Midwest Operations LLC, a subsidiary of Peabody Energy Corporation, received a notice from MSHA that a potential pattern of violations exists at the Willow Lake Portal Mine. The notification was based upon a screening by MSHA of compliance records and of accident and employment records at the mine. Peabody Midwest Operations LLC is questioning whether the mine meets the criteria in the scr eening based on conflicting data from the same source.
