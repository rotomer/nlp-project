Item 8.01 Other Events.
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act") was enacted. Section 1503 of the Act contains new reporting requirements regarding mine safety, including disclosing on a Current Report on Form 8-K the receipt of an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the "Mine Act") issued by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA"). On February 10, 2011, Peabody Midwest Mining LLC, a subsidiary of Peabody Energy Corporation, received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act alleging that a miner at the Air Quality Mine was observed performing the task of trying to remove scrap metal from a portable trash dumpster under circumstances which created a hazardous condition. The miner was immediately removed from the hazardous area. The order requires that the operator conduct a safety meeting with all miners to discuss the hazards related to the cited condition and to take steps to prevent any future occurrences.
