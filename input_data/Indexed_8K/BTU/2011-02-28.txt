Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
In connection with the finalization of Peabody Energy Corporation's (the Company) financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010, the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share (EPS) has been adjusted from the previously reported figures in the Company's January 25, 2011 press release. The adjustment reflects a revision in the dilutive impact of the Companys Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066. The revised weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2010 and the year ended December 31, 2010 was increased by 1.1 million for each of the respective periods. As a result of the change in weighted average diluted shares outstanding, the Companys diluted EPS for income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders decreased by $0.01 for both the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2010, to $0.77 and $2.86, respectively. In addition, the after-tax impact on EPS of the remeasurement of income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2010 was a decrease of $0.01 to $0.17. There was no impact on the per-share amount reported for remeasurement of foreign income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2010. The information contained in this Current Report shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
