     On May 3, 2011, the shareholders of Peabody Energy Corporation (the "Company") approved the 2011 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the "2011 Plan") at the Company's 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting"). The 2011 Plan replaces the 2001 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the "2001 Plan"), the Equity Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Non-Employee Directors Plan") and the 2004 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan"). Both the 2001 Plan and the Non-Employee Directors Plan expire on May 22, 2011. The 2004 Plan is being amended to provide that no further awards may be made under it on or after May 3, 2011.
     The 2011 Plan authorizes an aggregate of 14,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock be reserved for issuance of awards in a variety of forms including: (1) stock appreciation rights ("SARs"); (2) restricted stock; (3) incentive stock options; (4) nonqualified stock options; (5) stock units; and (6) performance awards. The 2011 Plan was filed as Appendix A to the Company's 2011 Proxy Statement, and the terms thereof are incorporated herein by reference.
     The Company held its Annual Meeting on May 3, 2011. Of the 270,600,359 shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date, 224,663,311 shares were present at the meeting in person or by proxy, representing approximately 83% of the total outstanding shares eligible to vote. The final results for each of the matters submitted to a vote of shareholders at the Annual Meeting are as follows:
     After consideration of the stockholders' recommendation, the Company's board of directors has determined that it will hold an advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers annually until the next required vote on the frequency of such an advisory vote.
