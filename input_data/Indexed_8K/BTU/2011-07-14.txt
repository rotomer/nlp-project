Item 8.01 Other Events.
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act") was enacted. Section 1503 of the Act contains new reporting requirements regarding mine safety, including disclosing on a Current Report on Form 8-K the receipt of an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the "Mine Act") issued by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA"). On July 11, 2011, Peabody Midwest Mining LLC, a subsidiary of Peabody Energy Corporation, received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act. The order alleged that a continuous mining machine operator, while moving the machine to a new location, caused himself to be positioned in an unsafe area between the machine and a solid coal pillar. Operating machinery in such a manner constitutes a violation of the company's safety and operating procedures, and a full internal investigation is planned.
