On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act") was enacted. Section 1503 of the Act contains new reporting requirements regarding mine safety, including disclosing on a Current Report on Form 8-K the receipt of an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the "Mine Act") issued by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA").
On July 26, 2011, Peabody Midwest Mining LLC, a subsidiary of Peabody Energy Corporation, received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act. The order alleged that a contractor at the new maintenance shop construction site was observed climbing an extended ladder with no back guards or any type of fall protection installed. The contractor was immediately removed from the hazard.
