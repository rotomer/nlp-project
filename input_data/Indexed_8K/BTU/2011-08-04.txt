Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Bid Documents
On August 1, 2011, Peabody Energy Corporation ("") and ArcelorMittal S.A. ("") announced that they had completed due diligence and intend to launch an all-cash off-market takeover bid to acquire all of the shares in Macarthur Coal Limited ("") at A$15.50 per share (the ""). Macarthur shareholders will also be entitled to retain any final dividend Macarthur declares for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, up to an amount of A$0.16 per share.

ArcelorMittal
Macarthur
Takeover Bid
A subsidiary of ArcelorMittal currently holds approximately 16% of the shares of Macarthur and, under the proposal between Peabody and ArcelorMittal, a newly formed company, indirectly owned 60% by Peabody and 40% by ArcelorMittal, would offer all of Macarthur's shareholders cash in exchange for their shares of Macarthur.
Peabody and ArcelorMittal and certain of their subsidiaries have entered into several agreements in connection with the Takeover Bid. On July 29, 2011, Peabody and ArcelorMittal and certain of their subsidiaries entered into a contribution and co-operation agreement (the ""), a pre-bid acceptance deed (the "") and a deed of guarantee (the ""). On August 2, 2011, certain subsidiaries of Peabody and ArcelorMittal entered into a CCA Acknowledgement (the "").
Contribution Agreement
Pre-Bid Acceptance Deed
Deed of Guarantee
CCA Acknowledgement
The Contribution Agreement regulates Peabody and ArcelorMittal's conduct in the Takeover Bid, including their joint bidding arrangements, their respective financing obligations and certain termination rights. The Contribution Agreement contains customary non-solicitation and non-compete provisions that run for the six month period beginning on the later of the date of the Contribution Agreement and the date of a formal Takeover Bid.
Under the Pre-Bid Acceptance Deed, the ArcelorMittal subsidiary that holds the 16% ownership interest in Macarthur has agreed to the Takeover Bid, if one is made, and to tender its Macarthur shares.
The Deed of Guarantee provides that each of Peabody and ArcelorMittal will guarantee for the benefit of the other the obligations of their respective subsidiaries party to the Contribution Agreement and the Pre-Bid Acceptance Letter.
The CCA Acknowledgement clarifies certain matters relating to the Takeover Bid, including regulatory approvals.
The foregoing descriptions of the Contribution Agreement, the Pre-Bid Acceptance Deed, the Deed of Guarantee and the CCA Acknowledgement (the "") do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents, which are filed hereto, respectively, as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 and are incorporated herein by reference.
Bid Documents
The Bid Documents contain representations and warranties of Peabody and ArcelorMittal and/or their affiliates made to each other as of specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the contracts between Peabody and ArcelorMittal and/or their affiliates and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by such parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the Bid Documents. Moreover, certain representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date because they are subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to shareholders, or were used for the purpose of allocating risk between Peabody and ArcelorMittal rather than establishing matters as facts. For the foregoing reasons, no person should rely on the representations and warranties as statements of factual information.
Bridge Commitment Letter
On July 29, 2011, Peabody entered into a bridge commitment letter (the "") with Bank of America, N.A., UBS Loan Finance LLC and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (the "") and certain of their affiliates, pursuant to which the Initial Lenders committed to provide to Peabody unsecured bridge financing of up to $2.0 billion (the " "), subject to customary funding conditions for transactions of

this type. The Bridge Facility will be available in up to three drawings, each in an amount equal to not less than $500 million, the proceeds of which will be used to finance in part the Takeover Bid and to pay fees and expenses related to the Takeover Bid and the Bridge Facility. The Bridge Facility will mature one year following the date of the initial funding, which must occur within nine months of the date of execution of the Bridge Commitment Letter. The obligations under the Bridge Facility will be guaranteed by Peabody's subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Agreement, dated as of June 18, 2010, among Peabody and the lenders and others party thereto (the ""). The Bridge Facility will contain covenants, including financial covenants, and events of default substantially the same as those set forth in the Credit Agreement.
Credit Agreement
The Initial Lenders and certain of their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with Peabody or its affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions.
The foregoing description of the Bridge Commitment Letter does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such document, which is filed hereto as Exhibit 10.5 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On August 1, 2011, Peabody issued a press release announcing its and ArcelorMittal's intention to launch the Takeover Bid. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
On August 4, 2011, Peabody issued a press release announcing that it and Arcelor Mittal had lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") a Bidder's Statement for the Takeover Bid. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
Forward-Looking Statements
This report and the exhibits hereto may contain certain statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Wherever possible, Peabody has identified these forward-looking statements by words such as "anticipates," "believes," "intends," "estimates," "expects," "projects" and similar phrases. These forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions its management believes are reasonable. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause Peabody's actual results, performance and achievements to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these statements, including, among other things, the risks and uncertainties disclosed in its annual report on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other reports it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.
Because these forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond Peabody's control or are subject to change, actual results could be materially different and any or all of these forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They speak only as of the date made and can be affected by assumptions Peabody might make, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in this document and the exhibits hereto and in Peabody's annual and quarterly reports will be important in determining future results. Consequently, Peabody cannot assure you that its expectations or forecasts expressed in such forward-looking statements will be achieved. Actual future results may vary materially. Except as required by law, Peabody undertakes no obligation to publicly update any of its forward-looking or other statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
PEABODY ENERGY AND ARCELORMITTAL SUBMIT ALL CASH OFFER TO ACQUIRE MACARTHUR COAL
Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) and ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT) today confirm that following the recent completion of due diligence they intend to launch an all-cash off-market takeover bid to acquire all the shares in Macarthur Coal Ltd (ASX: MCC).
St. Louis, Luxembourg, August 1 
Under the offer, Macarthur shareholders will be offered A$15.50 cash per share, valuing the equity in Macarthur at approximately A$4.7 billion.
Macarthur shareholders will also be entitled to retain any final dividend declared by Macarthur in respect of the financial year ended June 30, 2011, up to an amount of 16 cents per share, without reducing the offer price. This represents a total value of A$15.66 cash per share.
Following due diligence, Peabody and ArcelorMittal attempted to negotiate a bid implementation agreement (BIA) with Macarthur. However, Macarthur was not willing to engage on a BIA on customary terms even with Peabody and ArcelorMittal's willingness to improve the price from the original proposal if such a BIA could be
 
agreed. As a result, a formal offer was submitted to Macarthur, valuing the company at $15.66 per share (inclusive of the dividend) without a BIA while seeking a recommendation. The Macarthur board declined to recommend this offer.
"Peabody and ArcelorMittal believe our bid is compelling," said Peabody Energy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gregory H. Boyce, "And we have decided to take this attractive offer directly to Macarthur shareholders to provide them with significant value."
Aditya Mittal, CFO ArcelorMittal said, "We are making an attractive offer directly to shareholders, which represents a 41% premium to the closing price immediately before our approach was disclosed to the market."
The total value to be received by Macarthur shareholders of up to A$15.66 per share represents a substantial premium of:
Peabody and ArcelorMittal urge Macarthur shareholders to accept the offer to receive a substantial premium for their investment.
Should the offer be successful, Macarthur will form an integral part of Peabody Australia and expand ArcelorMittal's mining interests in the key resource market of Australia. Both Peabody and ArcelorMittal acknowledge and value the contribution that Macarthur employees will make to the ongoing operations and growth plans.
 
The offer is made by a newly formed company, PEAMCoal Pty Ltd (ACN 152 004 772), to be owned 60% by Peabody and 40% by ArcelorMittal. PEAMCoal has a relevant interest of 16.1% in Macarthur's shares. Committed financing for the transaction has been secured.
The offer is subject to a limited number of conditions including minimum 50.01% acceptances, approval by Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, other regulatory approvals and other standard conditions.
Peabody and ArcelorMittal expect to lodge the Bidder's Statement in relation to the offer with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC") shortly. The Bidder's Statement will set out in detail why Macarthur shareholders should accept the offer and will be dispatched to Macarthur shareholders approximately two weeks after its lodgement with ASIC. In the interim, any Macarthur shareholder seeking further information regarding the offer should contact PEAMCoal's Offer Information Line on 1800 992 039 (for callers within Australia) or +61 2 8280 7692 (for callers outside Australia).
UBS is serving as lead financial adviser to Peabody. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley are also providing financial advisory services, and Freehills is serving as legal adviser. ArcelorMittal has engaged RBC Capital Markets as its financial adviser and Mallesons Stephen Jaques as its legal adviser for the proposed transaction.
