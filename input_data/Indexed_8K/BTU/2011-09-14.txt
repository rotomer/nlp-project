Item 8.01 Other Events.
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act") was enacted. Section 1503 of the Act contains new reporting requirements regarding mine safety, including disclosing on a Current Report on Form 8-K the receipt of an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the "Mine Act") issued by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA"). On September 8, 2011, Peabody Midwest Mining LLC, a subsidiary of Peabody Energy Corporation, received an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Mine Act. An excessive methane level was detected approximately 18 inches to 24 inches from the mine roof in the #1 entry working place of the Air Quality Mine. An oral imminent danger order was issued, actions for excessive methane were immediately instituted and the methane was reduced to a safe level.
