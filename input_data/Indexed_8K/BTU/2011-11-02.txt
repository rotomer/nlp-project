On October 28, 2011, Peabody Energy Corporation ("") entered into a term loan credit agreement among Peabody, as borrower, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, UBS Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and RBS Securities Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint book managers and the other lenders party thereto, providing unsecured term loan financing (the "").
Peabody
Term Loan Facility
Upon the satisfaction of certain conditions customary for a facility of this type, the Term Loan Facility permits Peabody to borrow an aggregate principal amount of up to $1 billion and is available in multiple drawings for the six month period following the initial drawing. The proceeds will be used (i) to finance in part Peabody's and ArcelorMittal S.A. ("l") previously announced takeover offer (the "") by PEAMCoal Pty Ltd, a company which is indirectly owned 60% by Peabody and 40% by ArcelorMittal ("l") to acquire at least a majority ownership (the "") in Macarthur Coal Limited (""), (ii) to repay borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement (as defined below), the proceeds of which are used solely to finance the Acquisition, (iii) to refinance borrowings or permanently reduce commitments under the bridge loan agreement, dated as of October 24, 2011, between Peabody, the lenders and the other parties thereto (the ""), entered into to provide funding for the Acquisition and (iv) to pay fees and expenses related to the Acquisition, the Bridge Facility and the Term Loan Facility.
ArcelorMitta
Takeover Offer
PEAMCoa
Acquisition
Macarthur
Bridge Facility
On October 25, 2011, Peabody and ArcelorMittal announced that ArcelorMittal had elected to sell its interest in PEAMCoal to Peabody in lieu of proceeding with the PEAMCoal joint venture. As a result, Peabody will own 100% of PEAMCoal and will become the owner of all the Macarthur shares tendered in the Takeover Offer to acquire Macarthur.
Upon entry into the Term Loan Facility, Peabody reduced the commitments under the Bridge Facility by the principal amount of the Term Loan Facility, thereby reducing the aggregate principal amount of commitments under the Bridge Facility to $1 billion.
The obligations under the Term Loan Facility are unsecured and are guaranteed by the direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of Peabody that guarantee Peabody's existing Credit Agreement, dated as of June 18, 2010, among Peabody and the lenders and others party thereto (the "").
Existing Credit Agreement
Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest, at Peabody's option, at a rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin or (ii) a base rate (defined as the highest of (a) the Bank of America prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) one month LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin depends on the ratio of Peabody's consolidated debt to its adjusted consolidated EBITDA, and may range from 1.75% to 3.00% per year for borrowings bearing interest at LIBOR and from 0.75% to 2.00% per year for borrowings bearing interest at the base rate. Under the Term Facility, Peabody also pays customary fees and expenses, including a commitment fee on the unused portion of the term loan commitments. The Term Loan Facility matures five years from the initial funding thereunder.
The Term Loan Facility is voluntarily prepayable from time to time without premium or penalty, subject to certain reimbursements of the lenders' costs. The Term Loan Facility will be subject to quarterly amortization of 1.25% commencing six months after the initial funding thereunder, with the final payment of all amounts outstanding due five years from the date of such initial funding.
The Term Loan Facility contains covenants, including financial covenants, and events of default substantially the same as those set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement and contains customary representations and warranties. These covenants impose certain restrictions on Peabody and its restricted subsidiaries and provide for a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum leverage ratio and customary events of default, including a cross-default under Peabody's agreements governing its other indebtedness. If an event of default under the Term Loan Facility occurs and is continuing, then-outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest, together with any other amounts owed thereunder, may be declared immediately due and payable.
The initial lenders under the Term Loan Facility, the Bridge Facility and the Existing Credit Agreement and certain of their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with Peabody or its affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions.
The foregoing description of the Term Loan Facility does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such document, which is filed hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information set forth under Item 1.01 above is incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth herein.
On November 2, 2011, Peabody borrowed $1 billion under the Term Loan Facility.
Forward-Looking Statements
This report and the exhibit hereto may contain certain statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Wherever possible, Peabody has identified these forward-looking statements by words such as "anticipates," "believes," "intends," "estimates," "expects," "projects" and similar phrases. These forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions its management believes are reasonable. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause Peabody's actual results, performance and achievements to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these statements, including, among other things, the risks and uncertainties disclosed in its annual report on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other reports it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.
Because these forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond Peabody's control or are subject to change, actual results could be materially different and any or all of these forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They speak only as of the date made and can be affected by assumptions Peabody might make, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in this document and the exhibits hereto and in Peabody's annual and quarterly reports will be important in determining future results. Consequently, Peabody cannot assure you that its expectations or forecasts expressed in such forward-looking statements will be achieved. Actual future results may vary materially. Except as required by law, Peabody undertakes no obligation to publicly update any of its forward-looking or other statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. New York City time shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
General
(b) (i) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by ) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower

severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount, in immediately available funds, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
(ii) . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available funds, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.
Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent

2.11. Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on any Loans, shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of such Loans then held by the respective Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it, resulting in such Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the applicable Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:

The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

Any and all payments by or on behalf of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, that if any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from such payments (as reasonably determined in good faith by the applicable withholding agent), then (i) the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (after payment of all Indemnified Taxes) the Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made and (ii) if a Loan Party is the withholding agent, it shall make such deductions and timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Payments Free of Taxes

(b) . Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower
(c) . The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Payments under this Section shall be made within 10 days after written demand therefor. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Indemnification by the Borrower
(d) . As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, the applicable Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
Evidence of Payments
(e) . Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law and reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate
Status of Lenders
 
of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so, as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Each Lender that is a "U.S. Person" as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code that has not otherwise established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Borrower and Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant purchasing its participation from a Foreign Lender, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) that it is an exempt recipient (as defined in section 6049(b)(4) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) shall deliver to the Borrower and Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter as prescribed by applicable law or upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or Administrative Agent, but only if such Lender is legally entitled to do so), two duly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-9.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender holding any Loan to the Borrower shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), two copies of whichever of the following is applicable or any subsequent version thereof or successor thereto:
(i) duly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,
(ii) duly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI or IRS Form W-8IMY, as applicable, relating to all payments to be received by such Foreign Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document,
(iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank" within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a "10 percent shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN, or
(iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed and executed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
In the event that, pursuant to , a Participant is claiming the benefits of this , such Participant shall provide the forms required above, as if it were a Lender,
Section 10.06(d)
Section 3.01
 
to the Lender from which the related participation was purchased, and if such Lender is a Foreign Lender, such Lender shall, promptly upon receipt thereof (but in no event later than the next scheduled payment under this Agreement) (i) forward such documentation to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, together with two duly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, or (ii) provide the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with two duly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY certifying that such Lender is a "qualified intermediary."
Without limiting or duplicating the obligations of the Lenders set forth above regarding delivery of certain forms and documents to establish each Lender's status for U.S. withholding tax purposes (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes any documentation necessary to prevent withholding under Sections 1471 or 1472 of the Code), each Lender agrees promptly to deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as the Administrative Agent or the Borrower shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter (including upon the expiration or obsolescence of any such forms or documents and promptly after the occurrence of any event requiring a change from the most recent forms previously delivered), but only if such Lender is legally entitled to do so, such other documents and forms as would reduce or avoid any Indemnified Taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender outside of the U.S. by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender's status for withholding tax purposes in such other jurisdiction. Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps that are consistent with the internal tax policies and procedures of such Lender and as shall not be materially disadvantageous to such Lender in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction that the Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.
(f) . If the Administrative Agent or any Lender receives a refund with respect to Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Borrower, which in the sole discretion and good faith judgment of such Administrative Agent or Lender is allocable to such payment, it shall promptly pay such refund to the extent allocable to payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to the Borrower, net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Administrative Agent or Lender incurred in obtaining such refund; provided, however, that the Borrower agrees to promptly return such amount, net of any incremental additional costs, to the applicable Administrative Agent or Lender, as the case may be, if it receives notice from the applicable Administrative Agent or Lender that such Administrative Agent or Lender is required to repay such refund. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the Administrative Agent or any Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent or any Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent or Lender would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
 
3.02. If any Lender determines that as a result of any Change in Law it becomes unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all such Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
Illegality.
3.03. If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan, or (b) the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
Inability to Determine Rates.

provided
(b) . If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, after submission the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
Capital Requirements
(c) . A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section, describing the basis therefor and showing the calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof.
Certificates for Reimbursement
(d) . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
Delay in Requests
provided
 
(e) . The Borrower shall pay to each Lender,as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as ""), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive, absent manifest error), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Eurocurrency Rate Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive, absent manifest error), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, the Borrower shall have received at least 10 Business Days' prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender describing the basis therefor and showing the calculation thereof in reasonable detail. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 Business Days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or costs shall be due and payable within 30 days from receipt of such notice.
