EXPLANATORY NOTE
This Current Report on Form 8-K/A is being filed to correct an error in Peabody Energy Corporation's (the Company) Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) on February 21, 2012 (the Original Filing). Due to an administrative error, the Original Filing contained the text of a Current Report on Form 8-K that was timely filed with the Commission on February 1, 2012. The information contained in Item 1.04 of the Original Filing is replaced and superseded in its entirety by the information contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K/A.
Item 1.04  Mine Safety - Reporting of Shutdowns and Patterns of Violations.
 
On February 16, 2012, Peabody Caballo Mining, LLC (PMC), a subsidiary of Peabody Energy Corporation, was issued an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.  The mine involved was the Caballo Mine located near Gillette, Wyoming.  The order was issued due to a missing inspection and cover plate on an electrical breaker panel located inside an enclosed electrical box.  PMC believed that the order was issued in error and that the condition did not constitute an imminent danger for a number of reasons, including:  (1) the panel was protected by a closed access door which provides a barrier to personnel walking in the area; (2) only qualified personnel perform work or open the control box; (3) the open panel 220/110 power does not pose an arc hazard; and (4) warning labels were on the outer door.  After considering PMC's arguments, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) vacated the order on February 17, 2012, thus rescinding the order and rendering it void.
