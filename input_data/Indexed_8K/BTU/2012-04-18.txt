Item 1.04 Mine Safety - Reporting of Shutdowns and Patterns of Violations.
On April 13, Big Ridge, Inc., a subsidiary of Peabody Energy Corporation, was issued an imminent danger order under section 107(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The mine involved was the Willow Lake Mine located in Saline County, Illinois. On that date, an inspector from the Mine Safety and Health Administration measured an excess accumulation of methane in a specific area of the mine. Management immediately implemented corrective measures and the methane was reduced to an acceptable level within 15 minutes.
