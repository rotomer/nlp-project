Statement on Forward-Looking Information Peabody Energy
Some of the following information contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is intended to come within the safe-harbor protection provided by those sections. Our forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but they are open to a wide range of uncertainties and business risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations as of Sept. 6, 2012. These factors are difficult to accurately predict and may be beyond the company's control. The company does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements. Factors that could affect the company's results include, but are not limited to: global supply and demand for coal, including the seaborne thermal and metallurgical coal markets; price volatility, particularly in higher-margin products and in our trading and brokerage businesses; impact of alternative energy sources, including natural gas and renewables; global steel demand and the downstream impact on metallurgical coal prices; impact of weather and natural disasters on demand, production and transportation; reductions and/or deferrals of purchases by major customers and ability to renew sales contracts; credit and performance risks associated with customers, suppliers, contract miners, co-shippers, and trading, banks and other financial counterparties; geologic, equipment, permitting and operational risks related to mining; transportation availability, performance and costs; availability, timing of delivery and costs of key supplies, capital equipment or commodities such as diesel fuel, steel, explosives and tires; integration of Macarthur Coal Limited (PEA-PCI) operations; successful implementation of business strategies; negotiation of labor contracts, employee relations and workforce availability; changes in postretirement benefit and pension obligations and their funding requirements; replacement and development of coal reserves; availability, access to and the related cost of capital and financial markets; effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates (primarily the Australian dollar); effects of acquisitions or divestitures; economic strength and political stability of countries in which we have operations or serve customers; legislation, regulations and court decisions or other government actions, including, but not limited to, new environmental and mine safety requirements and changes in income tax regulations, sales-related royalties or other regulatory taxes; litigation, including claims not yet asserted; and other risks detailed in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The use of Peabody, the company, and our relate to Peabody, its subsidiaries and majority-owned affiliates.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting net interest expense, income taxes, asset retirement obligation expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization and amortization of basis difference associated with equity method investments. Adjusted EBITDA, which is not calculated identically by all companies, is not a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flow as determined in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a key measure of operating performance and also believes it is a useful indicator of the company's ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements.
Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Diluted EPS are defined as income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of the remeasurement of foreign income tax accounts. Management has included these measures because, in management's opinion, excluding such impact is a better indicator of the company's ongoing effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share, and is therefore more useful in comparing the company's results with prior and future periods.

Peabody Positioned for Success in Challenging Market Conditions Peabody Energy
Peabody's long-term coal market view remains favorable Strong growth for global met and thermal coal Solid growth for PRB and Illinois Basin regions
Near-term view is cautious given decline in global commodity demand and pricing caused by recession in Europe, sluggish U.S. growth and eased expansion in China
We are responding to macro conditions by further reducing capital spending, deferring early-stage expansion projects, reducing growth volumes and continuing to aggressively manage costs

Peabody Responding to Near-Term Market Conditions Peabody Energy
Completing late-stage development projects Deferring future growth projects until economy strengthens
Reducing 2012 capital to $1.0 billion - $1.1 billion Capex midpoint $250 million below original 2012 target Expect 2013 capital at or below 2012 levels
Slowing pace of Australia volume growth
Closing Air Quality Mine in Indiana due to market conditions
Aggressively managing cost structure
