BORGWARNER TURBO SYSTEMS CONTINUES SHIPMENTS UNDER AGREEMENT WITH HONEYWELL Chicago, Illinois, July 29, 2002 -- In order to continue uninterrupted service to its customer, BorgWarner Turbo Systems has agreed to pay Honeywell $25 million so that Turbo Systems can continue to make and ship disputed passenger car turbochargers through June of 2003. BorgWarner expects to absorb the cost and has not altered its earnings per share guidance of $5.50 for 2002. Sales under this agreement are estimated at approximately 9% of BorgWarner Turbo Systems sales (including sales through June of 2003). The agreement suspends a July preliminary injunction that limited shipments, and covers penalties and damages related to an infringement action decided in February. BorgWarner Turbo Systems is appealing the July action. The company reiterated its belief that its current production designs do not violate Honeywell patents and are not covered by their lawsuit. The company is pursuing all available legal means to resolve the situation. A hearing on the turbocharger model currently in dispute is still scheduled for December. BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) is a product leader in highly engineered components and systems for vehicle powertrain applications worldwide. The company operates manufacturing and technical facilities in 50 locations in 14 countries.
