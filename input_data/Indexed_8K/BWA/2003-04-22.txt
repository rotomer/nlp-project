[BORGWARNER LOGO] Contact: Mary Brevard 312/322-8683 BORGWARNER ACHIEVES FIRST QUARTER EPS OF $1.65; NEW BUSINESS, ENGINE AND FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEMS SPUR GROWTH Chicago, Illinois, April 22, 2003 BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) delivered earnings of $1.65 per share in the first quarter of 2003 on a 22% sales increase. New business worldwide and demand for the company's technology for fuel-efficient engines in Europe and four-wheel drive systems in North America continues to drive growth. Financial Results: Net earnings for the 2003 first quarter were $44.2 million or $1.65 per share, compared with $31.5 million, or $1.18 per share before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for goodwill in 2002. Sales were $775.7 million compared with $633.9 million in the prior first quarter. Comments and Outlook: "Our exceptional results were driven by continued strong demand in Europe for our fuel-efficient engine systems, and new business growth in North America for our computer-controlled four-wheel and all-wheel drive systems that enhance vehicle stability," said Timothy M. Manganello, President and CEO. "We expect continued growth in 2003 from this new business and increased sales to the faster growing parts of the auto market, even as worldwide auto production continues to soften." Last week, the company provided guidance for first half 2003 earnings per share in a range of $3.10 to $3.20. The guidance reflects more balanced financial performance between the first and second quarters than a year ago when new business accelerated in the second quarter, and anticipates lower industry production levels that are expected in the 2003 second quarter. The company also reiterated its guidance for full- year earnings per share of $6.20 to $6.35. Operating Group Results: Sales in the company's two operating groups were up significantly over the first quarter of 2002. The company's Engine Group registered a 20% sales gain to $465.8 million and a 25% gain in operating income. The group benefited from a number of positive trends during the quarter. These included continued demand for the company's chain timing systems and turbochargers for European passenger cars, growth in sales of turbochargers and cooling systems for European commercial vehicles, continued solid sales of sport-utility vehicles that increased demand for four-wheel drive chain, and sales growth for a variety of products in emerging markets such as India and China. - - more -
BorgWarner 2003 First Quarter results Page 2 The Drivetrain Group experienced sales growth of 27% to $321.7 million with operating income increasing by 33%. These gains were aided by four-wheel drive transfer case programs with General Motors, increased sales of the company's new InterActive Torque Management(TM) (ITM(TM)) all-wheel drive systems to Honda and Hyundai, and steady demand for transmission components and systems, especially with increased automatic transmission penetration in Europe. Recent Highlights: During the quarter, the company announced that the first application of BorgWarner DualTronic(TM), the company's wet-clutch and control-system technology for a new concept automated transmission, will debut this spring on the VW Golf R32 DSG and the Audi TT 3.2. The new technology enables a manual transmission to perform like an automatic transmission, yet deliver significantly improved vehicle fuel economy compared to automatic transmissions of today. The initials DSG stand for direct-shifting gearbox. The company also announced that its Engine Group will provide a new viscous fan drive and polymer fan system for Nissan's new I-4 engine beginning in March of 2005. The I-4 engine will be on two Nissan light vehicle models. BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) is a product leader in highly engineered components and systems for vehicle powertrain applications worldwide.
