[BORGWARNER Logo] Immediate Release Contact: Mary Brevard 312/322-8683 BORGWARNER EARNS $1.30 PER SHARE FOR Q303; ENGINE AND FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEMS CONTINUE TO SPUR GROWTH Chicago, Illinois, October 27, 2003 BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) delivered earnings of $1.30 per share in the third quarter of 2003 on a 6% sales increase. Increased demand for the company's fuel-efficient engine technology and four-wheel drive systems continued to drive growth. Financial Results: The company reported 2003 third quarter net earnings of $35.9 million or $1.30 per share, compared with $31.9 million, or $1.18 per share last year. Third quarter 2003 sales were $725.2 million compared with $684.0 million in the 2002 third quarter. These results came in the face of a very weak automotive market, with production soft in all regions, especially North America which was off 5%. Net earnings for the first nine months of 2003 were $124.9 million or $4.59 per share compared with $109.1 million or $4.07 per share for the 2002 period before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for goodwill. Sales were $2,270.4 million, up 12% over 2002 nine-month sales of $2,030.3 million. Comments and Outlook: "We continue to see strong sales growth for our turbochargers and four-wheel drive systems," said Timothy M. Manganello, Chairman and CEO. "These include our electronic all-wheel systems for crossover vehicles such as those from Honda, Acura and Hyundai, and four-wheel drive systems for new GM applications. In Europe, the demand for fuel-efficient cars is driving the growth of our engine-related products, while our Asian customers are experiencing significant growth in North America." Manganello tightened the company's full-year 2003 guidance to a range of $6.25 to $6.35 per share. Commenting on the company's 2004 outlook, Mr. Manganello noted that the company expects overall stability but little growth in the global auto market. "We expect BorgWarner's performance to continue to outpace that of the global auto industry because our powertrain technology serves the fastest growing areas of the market. With our fuel-efficient products for Europe and new business among Japanese and Korean automakers, we expect to achieve our growth targets of 8% to 11% in sales, and 12% to 16% in earnings in 2004. We will release our pipeline of new business for 2004 through 2006 in early November, and we expect this business to provide the platform for our growth." - -more-
BorgWarner 2003 Third Quarter Results Page 2 Operating Group Results: The company's Engine Group registered an 8% sales gain to $451.4 million with an increase in operating income. Strong sales of turbochargers boosted the group's results. The group continues to benefit from demand for the company's products for European passenger cars and commercial vehicles, and sales growth for a variety of products in emerging markets such as India and China, which more than offset weak North American markets. Sales for the Drivetrain Group were up 3% while operating income declined compared with last year's third quarter. Increased sales came from four-wheel drive systems. The impact of start-up costs for the group's new fuel-efficient transmission technology being introduced in Europe and mix changes combined to cause the short-term operating income decline. The company expects operating income improvements in the fourth quarter as new programs expand and cost reductions begin to be realized. Recent Highlights: During the quarter, the company announced a commitment for the first use of its patented Morse TEC Gemini(TM) chain system in a four-wheel drive transfer-case application for the 2004 Dodge Durango. In addition, BorgWarner TorqTransfer Systems will supply its InterActive Torque Management (ITM)(TM) system to the new Hyundai Santa Fe CM crossover utility vehicle, beginning in June 2005.
