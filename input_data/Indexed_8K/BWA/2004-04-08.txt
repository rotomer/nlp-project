"We expect to deliver continued growth in 2004 from our technologies that address the needs of our global customers for fuel efficiency, performance, air quality and vehicle stability," said Timothy M. Manganello, Chairman and CEO. "While there is uncertainty in the second half of the year from the impact of escalating prices for commodities like steel, we are working to offset these cost increases."
