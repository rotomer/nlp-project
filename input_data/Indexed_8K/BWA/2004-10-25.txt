EXHIBIT 99.1 [BORGWARNER LOGO] IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Mary Brevard 248/373-2406 BORGWARNER THIRD QUARTER EPS UP 22% TO $0.79; DEMAND IN EUROPE AND ASIA DRIVES 16% SALES GROWTH Chicago, Illinois, October 25, 2004 - BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2004 and reiterated fiscal 2004 guidance. Strong demand for its technology in Europe and Asia along with continued cost efficiencies helped boost results. THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS: o Earnings per share grew by 22% to a new third quarter record high of $0.79 o Sales were up 16% to $839.8 million o Operating income margin of 8.1% o Engine Group sales up 18% o Drivetrain Group sales up 12% "We had an outstanding third quarter," said Tim Manganello, Chairman and CEO. "Both our Engine and Drivetrain businesses had solid growth driven by demand for our systems which improve fuel economy, performance and air quality. This growth was achieved despite stagnant market conditions, including a year-over-year decline in North American production. BorgWarner sales in Europe and Asia were particularly strong. We translated this sales growth into improved profits, despite significant increases in steel and other commodity prices, by redoubling our focus on manufacturing and administrative cost reduction efforts, as well as on supply chain management. Despite continued commodity pricing pressure and expected declines in auto production in the fourth quarter, we are reiterating our guidance for the year of $3.60 to $3.70 per share. We expect to continue to grow faster than the automotive industry and will release our pipeline of new business for 2005 through 2007 in early November." Net earnings for the first nine months of 2004 were $150.6 million or $2.67 per share compared with $124.9 million or $2.30 per share in 2003. Sales were $2,636 million, up 16% over 2003 nine-month sales of $2,270.4 million. Operating income was $68.2 million or 8.1% of sales in the 2004 third quarter, compared with $56.5 million or 7.8% of sales in the 2003 third quarter. Research and development spending was $33.6 million in the quarter, versus $29.0 million in the same period in 2003. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 46% to $320.7 million for the first nine months of 2004 compared with $220.4 million for the same period in 2003. Investments in capital expenditures and net tooling totaled $167.2 million for the first nine months of 2004, compared with $132.9 million for the same period in 2003. Debt repayments were $61.0 million and cash and cash equivalents increased $75.9 million for the first nine months of 2004. -more-
BorgWarner 2004 Third Quarter Results - Page 2 ENGINE GROUP RESULTS: Strong demand from Asian and European automakers boosted the company's Engine Group sales 18% to $532.7 million with a 17% increase in earnings before interest and taxes to $65.2 million. The group continues to benefit from European and Asian automaker demand for the company's turbochargers, timing systems and emissions products, and from stronger commercial vehicle production in both Europe and North America. DRIVETRAIN GROUP RESULTS: Sales for the Drivetrain Group were up 12% and earnings before interest and taxes improved 46% compared to last year's third quarter. These gains were driven by demand for transmission and four-wheel drive systems, especially among Asian and European automakers. Productivity efforts more than offset the impact of commodity pricing, as well as health care costs. RECENT HIGHLIGHTS: During the quarter, BorgWarner began production of the engine chain timing system and will also supply the electronic throttle control for a world engine family of four-cylinder gasoline engines produced by a joint venture between Hyundai Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler AG and Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. Total annual world engine production is estimated at more than 1.6 million units. The company also supplies the engine chain timing system and the solenoid exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve to the popular DaimlerChrysler 5.7-liter HEMI engine. In the Drivetrain Group, BorgWarner TorqTransfer Systems has broadened its industry-leading capabilities in torque management with two new technologies that provide automakers and drivers with enhanced traction and stability for maximum performance and security as well as improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. Both the Pre-emptive Torque Management(TM) system and InterActive Differential Control(TM) system deliver the requested amount of torque in response to electronic signals provided by one or more of the vehicle's traction and/or stability control systems. They are both fully interactive with, and work in conjunction with, other vehicle systems. We are in development contracts in anticipation of commercializing this technology. BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) is a product leader in highly engineered components and systems for vehicle powertrain applications worldwide. The company operates manufacturing and technical facilities in 43 locations in 14 countries.
