 Item 8.01 Other Events.
On July 8, 2005, BorgWarner Inc. (the "Company") announced that it and other defendants, including the Company's subsidiary Kuhlman Corporation ("Kuhlman"), entered into a settlement regarding approximately 90% of claims related to previously disclosed alleged environmental contamination from a Kuhlman Electric Corporation ("KEC") plant site in Crystal Springs, Mississippi.  The alleged contamination related to activities that predate the Company's purchase of Kuhlman, the former parent of KEC.  In exchange for, among other things, the dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits, the defendants agreed to pay a total sum of up to $39 million in settlement funds.  The actual amount paid in the settlement funds will depend upon the number of plaintiffs who opt-out of the settlement. The settlement will be paid in three approximately equal installments in the third and fourth quarters of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.  
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.

"We are pleased to have the vast majority of this issue behind us and expect that the remainder can be resolved quickly and in a satisfactory manner," said Timothy Manganello, Chairman and CEO of BorgWarner.  
The company will incur an after-tax charge of approximately $29 million in the second quarter, or $0.50 per share, as a result of anticipated costs associated with settling all Crystal Springs-related claims. BorgWarner is also vigorously pursuing recovery of the settlement amount from various insurance carriers and other third parties and will reflect those recoveries as income in future periods as they become resolved.  
As a result of the $0.50 per share after-tax charge, the company says it now expects 2005 earnings per share in a range of $4.15 to $4.31 which includes the ($0.50) per share second quarter charge related to the Crystal Springs settlement and $0.38 per share associated with divestitures, the release of tax accruals and net of the immediate write-off of the excess purchase price associated with Beru's in-process R&D reported in the first quarter.  Previous earnings guidance for 2005 was $4.65 to $4.81 per share. The company reconfirms its expectations for earnings per share in a range of $4.27 to $4.43 on its base business plus the anticipated contribution from Beru, excluding the aforementioned items.
