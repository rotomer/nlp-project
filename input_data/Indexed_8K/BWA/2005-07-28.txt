"We had another strong quarter in spite of a challenging environment," said Tim Manganello, Chairman and CEO.  "Our results were driven by our technology that is targeted at the fastest growing parts of the market.  Our sales were up 11% in the quarter, excluding our acquisition of a majority stake in Beru, while worldwide industry production was up a modest 2%.  Sales including Beru were up 24% versus second quarter 2004.  Our Engine business had solid growth driven by demand for our technology, which improves fuel economy, performance and air quality, while the Drivetrain group reported sales slightly up versus second quarter 2004 despite a decline in North American light truck and sport-utility vehicle production.  We clearly demonstrated the viability of our technology-driven growth strategy and the benefits of building one of the most diverse customer bases in the industry."

  For second quarter 2005, strong demand and the acquisition of a majority stake in Beru boosted Engine Group sales 38% to $773.9 million with a 22% increase in segment earnings before interest and income taxes to $92.6 million.  The group continued to benefit from European and Asian automaker demand for turbochargers, timing systems and emissions products, and from stronger commercial vehicle production in both Europe and North America.
Engine Group Results:
  The Drivetrain Group had a solid quarter reporting sales growth of 1% and a 16% increase in segment earnings before interest and income taxes to $27.7 million. The group continued to benefit from growth outside of North America, including increased sales of dual-clutch transmission products, which offset the 4% decline in North American light truck and sport-utility vehicle volumes.
Drivetrain Group Results:
  During the quarter, BorgWarner announced that its Engine Group has begun production of turbochargers for Hyundai/Kia Motor Company in Korea.  The first of these are variable turbine geometry (VTG) systems for the new Kia Sorento 2.5 CRDI VTG diesel engine.
Recent Highlights:
The company is also supplying the turbocharger for the world's first gasoline engine to use both direct injection and a turbocharger, the Audi 2.0-liter Turbo FSI. The engine offers excellent performance with moderate fuel consumption while meeting EU4 and ULEV 2 exhaust emissions regulations. The engine was recently introduced in the new Audi A3 Sportback, and is now available on the Audi A4, the Golf GTI and the Passat.
The company entered into a settlement regarding approximately 90% of personal injury and property damage claims related to previously disclosed alleged environmental contamination from a Kuhlman Electric Corporation ("KEC") plant site in Crystal Springs, Mississippi. BorgWarner and other defendants will pay up to $39 million in three equal installments ending on January 2, 2006.
In its Drivetrain Group, the company's DualTronic(TM) technology for automated transmissions will be available on turbocharged direct-injected gasoline (TFSI) models of the all-new 2005 VW Jetta.
