"We had another strong quarter in spite of a challenging environment," said Timothy M. Manganello, Chairman and CEO. "Our results were driven by our technology that is targeted at improvements in fuel economy, emissions reduction and vehicle performance, the fastest growing parts of the market. Our sales were up 11% in the quarter, excluding sales from our first quarter 2005 acquisition of a majority stake in Beru, while worldwide industry production was up 5% and North American vehicle production was up 2%.  We clearly demonstrated the viability of our technology-driven growth strategy and the benefits of building one of the most diverse customer bases in the industry."
Comment and Outlook:
"Despite an increasingly difficult market, we intend to hold our guidance for the year within the lower end of our previous guidance range. We expect our growth to continue to outpace the industry and will release our new business backlog for 2006 through 2008 in early November."

Net cash provided by operating activities was $252.6 million in the first nine months of 2005 versus $320.7 million in the first nine months of 2004. Investments in capital expenditures and net tooling totaled $179.7 million for the first nine months of 2005, compared with $167.2 million for the same period in 2004. Balance sheet debt was higher by $216.1 million, and cash and cash equivalents was lower by $90.2 million at the end of third quarter 2005 compared with end of fourth quarter 2004, primarily due to the first quarter 2005 funding of the Beru acquisition.
The reduction from 2004 is primarily due to the 2004 funding of employee retirement benefits with common stock and increased foreign tax payments in 2005.
  For third quarter 2005, strong demand and the first quarter 2005 acquisition of a majority stake in Beru boosted Engine Group sales 38% to $736.7 million with a 46% increase in segment earnings before interest and income taxes to $95.4 million. The group continued to benefit from European and Asian automaker demand for turbochargers, timing systems and emissions products, and from stronger commercial vehicle production in both Europe and North America.
Engine Group Results:
  The Drivetrain Group reported sales growth of 2% to $324.4 million, while segment earnings before interest and income taxes were down 8% to $22.5 million. The group continued to benefit from sales growth outside of North America, including increased sales of dual-clutch transmission products, but segment earnings were negatively impacted by the lower domestic production of light trucks and sport-utility vehicles equipped with its torque transfer products.
Drivetrain Group Results:
  During the quarter, BorgWarner entered into a collaborative relationship with Modine Manufacturing Company to develop thermal management solutions for truck and off-highway applications worldwide.
Recent Highlights:
The company also announced that Volkswagen's new "Twincharger" engine, the first dual-charged direct-injected gasoline engine, will use BorgWarner turbochargers. The engine, which is boosted by a supercharger and a BorgWarner K03 turbocharger, is expected to debut on the new VW Golf GT in November 2005.

In addition, the company announced three new European programs, and two new European customers, for its fuel-efficient DualTronic transmission technology. Total BorgWarner DualTronic technology programs announced to date represent an expected 1.5 million transmissions per year at full production volumes.
The company also announced that it is supplying the all-wheel drive transfer case to the new Ssangyong Kyron sport-utility vehicle, and the all-wheel drive transfer case to the new Audi Q7, a luxury performance sport-utility vehicle on which the transfer case will be standard.
