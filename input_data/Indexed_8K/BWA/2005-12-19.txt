ITEM: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
On December 19, 2005, BorgWarner Inc. ("BorgWarner") adopted amendments to the BorgWarner Inc. 2004 Deferred Compensation Plan, and the BorgWarner Inc. Board of Directors Deferred Compensation Plan (collectively, the "Plans").  The Plans are nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements offered by BorgWarner to eligible executives and to non-employee directors of BorgWarner, respectively.  Under the Plans, participants may elect to defer portions of their current compensation from BorgWarner (for later payment in accordance with the distribution provisions of the Plans) and are credited with deemed earnings during the deferral period.  The Plans were amended to implement certain transition rules set forth in published guidance of the Internal Revenue Service for Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code Section 409A").  Enacted in October, 2004, Code Section 409A imposes new requirements on nonqualified deferred compensation, generally effective for amounts deferred after December 31, 2004.  Under these transition rules, BorgWarner was permitted to offer the Plans' participants the opportunity in 2005 to make new deferral elections with respect to 2005 deferrals or to revoke previously-made elections with respect to 2005 deferrals. Under the transition rules, BorgWarner is required to amend the Plans in 2005 to authorize the new deferral elections and the revocation elections.  These amendments to the Plans have been adopted to satisfy this requirement. SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
