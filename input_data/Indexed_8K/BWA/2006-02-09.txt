- BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE:BWA) today reported 2005 full-year earnings of $4.17 per diluted share on a U.S. GAAP basis, which included ($0.16) per diluted share related to special items. Excluding these special items, earnings were $4.33 per diluted share. The powertrain systems supplier delivered solid results in spite of flat vehicle production in North America and Europe.

"We had a strong fourth quarter and another outstanding year, relative to overall industry conditions," said Tim Manganello, Chairman and CEO.  "Our results were driven by our technology that is targeted at improvements in fuel economy, emissions reduction and vehicle performance, the fastest growing parts of the market.  Our sales were up 7% in 2005, excluding sales from our first quarter 2005 acquisition of a majority stake in Beru, while North American vehicle production was flat and worldwide vehicle production was up approximately 4%.  We clearly demonstrated the viability of our technology-driven growth strategy and the benefits of building one of the most diverse customer bases in the industry."
Comment and Outlook:
    The company reiterated that it expects 2006 earnings per diluted share, on a U.S. GAAP basis, in a range of $4.22 to $4.57, which includes ($0.16) to ($0.18) per diluted share negative impact of the implementation of FAS 123(R) and ($0.12) to ($0.25) per diluted share negative impact of weaker foreign currencies.  Also, the company expects to maintain operating margins in 2006 despite continued raw material and energy cost increases, rising healthcare costs and the costs related to global expansion.
  For fourth quarter 2005, sales were $1,048.0 million, up 17.9% from $889.2 million in fourth quarter 2004.  Excluding Beru, sales were up 3.4% in fourth quarter 2005. Net income in the quarter was $64.6 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, compared with $67.7 million, or $1.19 per diluted share in last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2005 net income included final purchase accounting adjustments related to the first quarter 2005 acquisition of a majority stake in Beru of ($5.1) million, or ($0.09) per diluted share. As part of the Beru final purchase price allocation process, the excess purchase price allocated to in-process R&D, customer order backlog and inventory, increased $6.7 million in the fourth quarter from the amount reported in first quarter 2005, and was subsequently written off in the quarter. In addition, $40.6 million of Beru assets, which were previously considered to be cash equivalents, have been determined to be marketable securities and have been reflected as such on the year-end balance sheet. Correspondingly, the Payments for business acquired, net of cash acquired line item in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows has been increased to $477.2 million to reflect the $47.8 million value of the marketable securities acquired in January 2005, and 2005 prior quarters will be conformed accordingly. Fourth quarter 2004 net income included favorable year-end adjustments to tax accounts of $11.4 million, or $0.20 per diluted share. The impact of weaker foreign currencies in fourth quarter 2005, primarily the Euro and the Japanese Yen, reduced sales by $9.7 million and net income by $0.3 million.
Financial Results:
    Sales for 2005 totaled $4,293.8 million, up 21.8% from $3,525.3 million in 2004. Excluding Beru, sales were up 7.3% in 2005. Full-year 2005 net income was $239.6 million, or $4.17 per share, compared with $218.3 million, or $3.86 per share in 2004.  Full-year 2005 net income includes normalized earnings related to Beru of $9.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share; purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of a majority stake in Beru, reported in the first and fourth quarters, of ($12.2) million, or ($0.21) per diluted share; net gains from divestitures, reported in the first quarter, of $6.3 million, or $0.11 per diluted share; favorable tax adjustments, reported in the first and third quarters, of $25.7 million, or $0.45 per diluted share; a charge associated with the anticipated cost of settling all Crystal Springs-related alleged environmental contamination personal injury and property damage claims, reported in the second quarter, of ($28.7) million, or ($0.50) per diluted share. Full-year 2004 net income included favorable year-end adjustments to tax accounts of $11.4 million, or $0.20 per diluted share. The increase in foreign currencies, primarily the Korean Won, added $23.9 million to sales in 2005 compared with 2004, and $3.1 million to net income.

    The normalized earnings related to Beru reflect BorgWarner's 69.42% ownership share of Beru, adjusted by BorgWarner from International Financial Reporting Standards to U.S. GAAP, and include expenses related to the recurring amortization of approximately 49.0% of the excess purchase price and BorgWarner's acquisition financing costs. Fourth quarter and full-year 2004 and 2005 net income excluding special items and the normalized earnings related to Beru are provided for comparisons with other reporting periods.
    Net cash provided by operating activities was $394.5 million in 2005. Investments in capital expenditures of $246.7 million, together with net tooling outlays of $45.8 million, totaled $292.5 million for 2005, compared with $252.4 million for 2004.  Debt increased $156.0 million and cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased $99.4 million in 2005, primarily due to the funding of the first quarter 2005 acquisition of a majority stake in Beru.
  Strong demand for Engine Group products and the first quarter 2005 acquisition of a majority stake in Beru boosted Engine Group sales in both the fourth quarter and the full year. Sales were up 28.9% to $731.7 million in the fourth quarter with a 22.8% increase in segment earnings before interest and income taxes to $89.5 million. Excluding Beru, sales were up 6.3% with an 8.5% increase in segment earnings before interest and income taxes in the quarter. For the full year, sales were up 35.5% to $3,004.7 million with a 25.8% increase in segment earnings before interest and income taxes to $354.5 million. Excluding Beru, sales were up 12.5% with a 13.7% increase in segment earnings before interest and income taxes for the full year. The group continued to benefit from European and Asian automaker demand for turbochargers, timing systems and emissions products, and from stronger commercial vehicle production in both Europe and North America.
Engine Group Results:
  Sales were down 2.0% to $326.2 million in the fourth quarter with a 12.5% decrease in segment earnings before interest and income taxes to $24.5 million. For the full year, sales were down 1.8% to $1,333.7 million with an 8.7% decrease in segment earnings before interest and income taxes to $97.6 million.  The group continued to benefit from sales growth outside of North America, including increased sales of dual-clutch transmission products, but segment earnings were negatively impacted by the lower domestic production of light trucks and sport-utility vehicles equipped with its torque transfer products.
Drivetrain Group Results:
  During the fourth quarter 2005, the company announced $1.6 billion of expected net new powertrain business for 2006 through 2008.
Recent Highlights:
    The company's board of directors approved a 14% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per share on all of the company's issued and outstanding common stock.
    In the Drivetrain Group, BorgWarner is broadening its all-wheel drive presence in South Korea with a new facility in Ochang. This facility will be an addition to an all-wheel drive sales and engineering support office located in Seoul, and three other BorgWarner operations in South Korea.
    BorgWarner will also supply its ITM 3e torque management system for the Chery Tiggo 4x4i, the first Chinese OEM-designed crossover vehicle to be built in China using an active rather than passive all-wheel drive system.
    In response to increasing demand for BorgWarner DualTronic transmission technology in Europe, and associated new business gained in transmission controls systems, the company has broken ground for a larger facility in Tulle, France, replacing its current operations. The operation will include application engineering, testing and manufacturing capabilities for these systems.  BorgWarner's fuel-efficient DualTronic wet dual-clutch module technology will make its debut in India on the Skoda Laura, which is being launched this year, its first application outside of Europe.
