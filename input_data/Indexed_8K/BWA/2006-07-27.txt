 BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) second quarter sales and income showed strong growth over last year, driven by the demand for fuel-efficient engine and drivetrain technology around the world. 
Auburn Hills, Michigan, July 27, 2006
 
Second Quarter Highlights:
        Earnings of $1.21 per diluted share, which included $(0.04) per diluted share related to the implementation of FAS 123(R)
        Record sales of $1,169 million, up 5% versus second quarter 2005
        Sales outside of the U.S. grew 12% over second quarter 2005
        Operating income margin of 9.2%
       
On a comparable non-U.S. GAAP basis, earnings increased 11% in the quarter
        Company revised its 2006 full year guidance range to $4.35 to $4.60 per diluted share
 
We operate in a tough industry environment but continue to deliver solid results, said Tim Manganello, Chairman and CEO.  BorgWarners leadership in powertrain technology that improves fuel economy, reduces emissions and improves performance sets us apart from other suppliers.  Our sales were up 5% in the second quarter of 2006,
Comment and Outlook:
while North American vehicle production was flat and worldwide vehicle production was up approximately 3%
. Because of our presence in growing markets, such as Korea, India and China, as well as our relationships with emerging auto industry leaders, we expect to continue to outpace industry growth. 
 
The company revised its 2006 full year guidance range to $4.35 to $4.60 per diluted share, at the high end of the previous range of $4.22 to $4.57 per diluted share. While we have moved our guidance to the higher end of the previous range, we remain cautious concerning the second half of the year, Manganello said.  Market share shifts and continued weakness in sport-utility and light truck sales continue to create uncertainty in North America.  Strong demand for our products in the rest of the world will drive our results.  We also expect to maintain operating margins in 2006 despite continued raw material and energy cost increases, rising health care costs and the costs related to global expansion.

Second quarter 2005 net income included a $(28.7) million charge, or $(0.50) per diluted share, related to special items.
Financial Results:
 
For the first six months of 2006, sales were $2,323.9 million, up 6% from $2,194.9 million in the first six months of 2005. For the first six months of 2006, net income was $131.5 million, or $2.27 per diluted share, compared with $113.5 million, or $1.99 per diluted share in the first six months of 2005.

The impact of currency was not meaningful in second quarter 2006 when compared with second quarter 2005. For the first six months of 2006, the decline in the Euro, the Japanese Yen and other currencies reduced sales by $45 million versus the first six months of 2005, and net income by $4 million, or $0.07 per diluted share.
 
Operating income was $107.5 million or 9.2% of sales in second quarter 2006 versus $58.7 million or 5.3% of sales in the second quarter 2005. Excluding the impact of FAS 123(R) from second quarter 2006 and special items from second quarter 2005, second quarter 2006 operating income margin was 9.5%, up slightly from 9.4% a year ago. Research and development spending was $47.8 million in the quarter versus $40.0 million in 2005.
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $233.2 million in the first six months of 2006 versus $186.1 million in the first six months of 2005. Investments in capital expenditures of $113.2 million, together with net tooling outlays of $32.3 million, totaled $145.5 million for the first six months of 2006, compared with $113.4 million for the same period in 2005.
 
Balance sheet debt decreased by $54.7 million, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $22.5 million, and marketable securities increased by $20.8 million at the end of second quarter 2006 compared with the end of 2005.
  Strong global demand for its products boosted Engine Group second quarter 2006 sales 8% versus second quarter 2005 to $792.0 million with a 6% increase in earnings before interest and taxes to $95.4 million. The group continued to benefit from Asian automaker demand for turbochargers and timing systems, European automaker demand for turbochargers, timing systems, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valves and diesel engine ignition systems, the continued roll-out of its variable cam timing systems with General Motors high-value V6 engines, stronger EGR valve sales in North America, and higher turbocharger and thermal products sales due to stronger global commercial vehicle production.
Engine Group Results:
 
  Second quarter 2006 sales were down 1% versus second quarter 2005 to $386.3 million with a 6% decrease in segment earnings before interest and income taxes to $28.6 million. The group continued to benefit from growth outside of North America including the continued ramp up of dual-clutch transmission and torque transfer product sales in Europe. In the U.S., the group was negatively impacted by lower production of light trucks and sport-utility vehicles equipped with its torque transfer products.
Drivetrain Group Results:
 
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company assigned an operating facility previously reported in the Engine segment to the Drivetrain segment due to changes in the facilitys product mix. Prior period segment amounts have been re-classified to conform to the current years presentation.
 
  In the first North American application of BorgWarners Interactive Torque Management (ITM 3e) system, BorgWarner's all-wheel drive (AWD) technology will be standard on the 2007 model year Chrysler Pacifica models with AWD, which is expected to launch later this year.
 Recent Highlights:
   
 
BorgWarner is developing new high-flow air pump technology designed to address its global customers need to meet increasingly stringent industry standards for emissions and fuel economy. The new BorgWarner high-flow air pump technology enables the replacement of dual-pump systems with a single, submersible, high-flow pump  called 1000-T3. The benefits include reductions in cost, space, and weight, as well as enhanced energy conversion efficiency.
