 BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) second quarter sales showed strong growth over last year, driven by the demand for fuel-efficient engine and drivetrain technology around the world. The company posted solid earnings growth in the quarter despite the impact of lower domestic vehicle production and sharply higher commodity costs.
Auburn Hills, Michigan, July 26, 2007
Second Quarter Highlights:
BorgWarner had an outstanding quarter, said Tim Manganello, Chairman and CEO.  Our sales outside of the U.S. were up 20%, excluding the impact of currency, compared with vehicle production outside of the U.S. that was up 5%. Global powertrain technology trends toward improved fuel economy, lower emissions and better vehicle performance, continued to drive strong growth for the company. Sales in the U.S. were up 2%, despite lower U.S. vehicle production, which was down 3%. Our technology leadership, global presence and customer diversity have been key elements in the successful execution of our growth strategy.
Comment and Outlook:
 
Furthermore, the restructuring of our North American operations in the second half of 2006, actions we took in anticipation of permanent reductions in customer production schedules, has stabilized our margins.
Due to the favorable impact of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, the company now expects sales growth of greater than 10% in 2007, and has raised its 2007 full year earnings guidance range to $4.63 to $4.83 per diluted share, which includes the impact of a $0.17 per diluted share warranty-related charge taken in first quarter 2007. Operating margins are expected to be near the low end of its historical range of 8.5% to 9.0%.
  Sales were $1,364.3 million in second quarter 2007, up 17% from $1,168.7 million in second quarter 2006.  Net income in the quarter was $75.7 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, compared with $70.2 million, or $1.21 per diluted share in second quarter 2006. The impact of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, increased sales by $51.3 million, or 4%, in second quarter 2007 compared with the same period in 2006, and net income by $2.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.
Financial Results:
 
Sales were $2,642.1 million in the first six months of 2007, up 14% from $2,323.9 million in the first six months of 2006.  Net income was $134.1 million in the first six months of 2007, or $2.28 per diluted share, compared with $131.5 million, or $2.27 per diluted share in the first six months of 2006. The impact of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, increased sales by $111.3 million, or 5%, in the first six months of 2007 compared with the same period in 2006, and net income by $5.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted share.
Operating income was $113.6 million, or 8.3% of sales, in second quarter 2007 versus $107.5 million, or 9.2% of sales, in second quarter 2006. Research and development spending was $56.7 million in the quarter versus $47.8 million in 2006.
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $223.4 million in first six months of 2007 versus $233.2 million in the first six months of 2006. Investments in capital expenditures, including tooling outlays, totaled $122.5 million for the first six months of 2007, compared with $145.5 million for the same period in 2006.
 
Balance sheet debt decreased by $75.7 million, cash decreased by $4.8 million, and marketable securities decreased by $0.7 million at the end of second quarter 2007 compared with the end of 2006.
  Engine Group second quarter 2007 sales were up 21% versus second quarter 2006 to $955.4 million, while earnings before interest and income taxes were up 14% to $108.3 million. Sales outside of the U.S. were up 18% excluding the impact of foreign currencies, as the group continued to benefit from European and Asian automaker demand for turbochargers, timing systems and emissions products, and European demand for diesel engine ignition systems. Sales in the U.S. were up 10% as increased turbocharger sales more than offset lower domestic sales of other Engine Group products, which were lower primarily due to lower domestic vehicle production. Segment earnings in the quarter were negatively impacted by sharply higher commodity costs, primarily nickel. In the quarter, gross nickel-related costs were approximately $37 million higher than second quarter 2006.
Engine Group Results:
  Drivetrain Group second quarter 2007 sales were up 8% versus second quarter 2006 to $417.7 million, while earnings before interest and income taxes were up 16% to $33.3 million. Sales outside of the U.S. were up 14%, excluding the impact of foreign currencies and the acquisition of the European transmission and engine solenoid product lines from Eaton Corporation, as the group continued to benefit from increased demand for dual-clutch transmission and torque transfer products. Sales in the U.S. were down 6% primarily due to the impact of lower domestic vehicle production.
Drivetrain Group Results:
 
 
  BorgWarner received a number of awards and commendations in recent months:
Recent Highlights:
Driven by growing global demand for its dual-clutch transmission technology, known as DualTronic, the Drivetrain Group broke ground for a second manufacturing facility at its Drivetrain campus in Arnstadt, Germany.
 
Furthermore, BorgWarners Board of Directors approved investment in a new Drivetrain Manufacturing Campus in Mexico that will produce dual-clutch transmission modules for the companys first North American program. The plant is expected to produce approximately 680,000 dual-clutch transmission modules annually at full production volumes.  Additionally, the campus will complement the companys other North American transmission component and all-wheel drive production capacity.
 
Propelled by growing demand in the rapidly expanding Chinese automotive market, the Engine Group broke ground for a new thermal systems production facility at its campus in Ningbo, China. The facility, which will be BorgWarners largest in China, will produce fans, viscous fan drives, Visctronic fan drives, water pumps, electronic water pumps and oil pumps. Additionally, BorgWarners Board of Directors, yesterday, approved investment in a new Technical Center in Shanghai, China to support the companys accelerating growth in all its product technologies in that country.  Product development will support the needs of Chinese vehicle makers as well as support other global and regional customers.
 
BorgWarners Board of Directors also approved investment in a new production facility in Poland to meet the continued demand for fuel-efficient turbocharged engines, both diesel and gasoline.  The plant will have capacity to make 500,000 turbochargers per year.
