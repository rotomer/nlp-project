Item 5.02(e)  
Compensatory Arrangements for Certain Officers
 
On August 3, 2007 the Compensation Committee awarded 126,637 Stock Units to the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Timothy Manganello, pursuant to the BorgWarner Inc. Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, (the Plan).  Each Stock Unit represents a contingent right to receive one share of common stock, par value $.01 of the Company (Stock).  This award was made in recognition of the outstanding performance of the Company and Mr. Manganellos leadership in achieving that success, and to assure, to the extent possible, continued retention of Mr. Manganellos services as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
The Stock Units vest as follows:
Except as described below, vested Stock Units will be settled in stock of the Company upon termination of employment, subject to any delay required by law.
If the Company terminates Mr. Manganellos employment for Cause (as defined in the Plan), Mr. Manganello will forfeit any unvested Stock Units and will forfeit the right to receive Stock in respect of vested Stock Units.
If Mr. Manganello voluntarily terminates employment with the Company (other than for Good Reason, as defined), Mr. Manganello will forfeit unvested Stock Units and if, prior to the first to occur of a Change of Control (as defined in the Plan) or August 3, 2010, Mr. Manganello joins or provides consultation or advisory services to a competitor, the award agreement requires Mr. Manganello to also return any then-vested portion of the award.
The award agreement provides for 100% vesting of the Stock Units in the event of death, disability, involuntary separation other than for cause, termination of employment by Mr. Manganello for Good Reason and in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan).
