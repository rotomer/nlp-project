Deloitte continued as the Company's auditor for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. With the filing on February 12, 2009 of the Company's Annual Report of Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, Deloitte was dismissed as the Company's independent auditor and the Company's auditor  client relationship with Deloitte effectively ceased.
Deloitte's audit report dated February 12, 2009 on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that the audit report included an emphasis of a matter indicating that as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its methods of accounting in 2007 for income taxes as a result of adopting FASB Interpretation No. 48, , and in 2006 for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as a result of adopting SFAS No. 158, .
