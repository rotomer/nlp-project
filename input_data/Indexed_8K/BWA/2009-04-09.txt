Underwriting Agreement
     On April 6, 2009, BorgWarner Inc. (the "Company") entered into an underwriting agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement ") under which it agreed to sell $325 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.50% convertible senior notes due 2012 (the " Notes ") to certain underwriters named therein (collectively, the " Underwriters "). The Underwriting Agreement also granted the Underwriters the option to purchase up to an additional $48.75 million aggregate principal amount of Notes to cover over-allotments. The Underwriters fully exercised their over-allotment option. The closing of the Notes occurred on April 9, 2009. The description of the Underwriting Agreement herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such Underwriting Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
Indenture
     The Notes are governed by an indenture dated September 23, 1999 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee "), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture thereto, dated as of April 9, 2009. Pursuant to the Indenture, interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate of 3.50% per annum on the principal amount from April 9, 2009, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2009. The Notes will mature on April 15, 2012 (the "Maturity Date "), subject to earlier conversion or repurchase. The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to the Maturity Date.
Conversion Rights
     Holders may convert their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the Maturity Date of the Notes, in equal multiples of $1,000 principal amount.
     The initial conversion rate for the Notes will be 30.4706 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $32.82 per share of the Company's common stock. Such conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain events, but will not be adjusted for accrued interest, including any additional interest.
     Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination thereof at the Company's election (the "Conversion Obligation"). If the Company satisfies its Conversion Obligation solely in cash or through payment and delivery, as the case may be, of a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, the amount of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, if any, due upon conversion will be based on a daily conversion value (as described in the Indenture) calculated on a proportionate basis for each trading day in the 40 trading-day cash settlement averaging period (as described in the Indenture).
Table of Contents
Fundamental Change
     Upon the occurrence of certain fundamental corporate changes, holders will have the option to require the Company to purchase the Notes or any portion of the principal amount thereof that is equal to $1,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000. In such event, the Company must pay a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, including any additional interest. Any Notes purchased by the Company pursuant to the provisions for fundamental change will be paid for in cash.
Events of Default
     The Indenture includes customary events of default, including, among other things, payment default, covenant default, conversion default, certain defaults under other indebtedness of the Company or certain of its subsidiaries, the failure to timely satisfy judgments over a certain sum against the Company or certain of its subsidiaries, failure to provide certain notices required by the Indenture and bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization affecting the Company or certain of its subsidiaries.
Ranking
     The Notes will be equal in right of payment with the Company's existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior in right of payment to the Company's debt that is expressly subordinated to the Notes, if any. The Indenture does not limit the amount of debt that the Company or its subsidiaries may incur. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and guarantees of the Company's debt) of the Company's subsidiaries, including such subsidiaries' guarantees of the Company's indebtedness under the Company's revolving credit facility and existing notes. The Notes will also be effectively junior to the Company's secured debt, if any, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt.
     The description of the Indenture herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such Indenture, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
Convertible Note Hedges; Warrants
     Concurrently with the pricing of the Notes, on April 6, 2009 the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock (the "Convertible Note Hedges" ) with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated as agent for Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc and Bank of America, N.A., affiliates of two of the Underwriters (collectively, the "Hedge Counterparties "). The Convertible Note Hedges cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 9.9 million shares of the Company's common stock at an initial strike price equal to the Initial Conversion Price.
     Separately and concurrently with the pricing of the Notes, on April 6, 2009, the Company entered into warrant transactions (the "Warrants") whereby it sold to the Hedge Counterparties
Table of Contents
warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, up to approximately 9.9 million shares of its common stock at an initial strike price of approximately $38.61.
     The Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants are separate transactions (in each case entered into by the Company with the Hedge Counterparties), are not part of the terms of the Notes and thus will not affect the holders' rights under the Notes. The Convertible Note Hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution with respect to the Company's common stock upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Company's common stock, as measured under the Convertible Note Hedges, at the time of conversion is greater than the strike price of the Convertible Note Hedges, which corresponds to the Initial Conversion Price of the Notes and is similarly subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. If, however, the volume-weighted price per share of the Company's common stock exceeds the strike price of the Warrants when they expire, there would be additional dilution from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the Warrants.
     The description of the Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements, forms of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, respectively, and incorporated by reference herein.
Use of Proceeds
     After deducting the discount to the Underwriters, the net proceeds to the Company from the offering of Notes are $362,537,500. The Company expects to use the net proceeds of the offering of Notes for general corporate purposes, including to repay short-term indebtedness, after applying a portion of the net proceeds for the cost of the convertible note hedges after such cost is offset by the proceeds of the warrant transactions described above
     The cost of the convertible note hedges, after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants, was approximately $21.9 million. The Company expects to use the remaining proceeds, together with the proceeds from the sale of additional warrants, for general corporate purposes.
     The Underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking, commercial banking, corporate trust, financial advisory and other commercial services in the ordinary course of business with the Company. Affiliates of the underwriters act as administrative agent, syndication and lenders under the Company's multi-currency revolving credit facility.
     This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

2. Agreements to Sell and Purchase
     On the basis of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to its terms and conditions, the Company agrees to sell to the Underwriters the Additional Securities, and the Underwriters shall have the right to purchase, severally and not jointly, up to the aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto at the purchase price set forth in Schedule I, plus accrued interest, if any, from the Closing Date to the Option Closing Date. The Representatives may exercise this right on behalf of the Underwriters in whole or from time to time in part by giving written notice. Any exercise notice shall specify the aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities to be purchased by the Underwriters and the date on which such securities are to be purchased. Each purchase date must be at least one business day after the written notice is given, unless waived in writing by the Company, may not be earlier than the Closing Date for the Firm Securities nor later than ten business days after the date of such notice and must be within the thirteen day period beginning with the Closing Date. Additional Securities may be purchased solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments made in connection with the offering of the Firm Securities. On each day, if any, that Additional Securities are to be purchased (an "Option Closing Date"), each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase the aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities (subject to such adjustments to eliminate fractional Securities as the Representatives may determine), that bears the same proportion to the total aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities to be purchased on such Option Closing Date as the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto opposite the name of such Underwriter bears to the total aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities.
          . The Company is advised by you that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of their respective portions of the Securities as soon after the Registration Statement and this Agreement have become effective as in your judgment is advisable. The Company is further advised by you that the Securities are to be offered to the public upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus.

Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (other than with respect to the registration Statement, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein.
          (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.

In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.

final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by, or on behalf of, any indemnified party.
          (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in or is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
Section 8(a)
Section 8(b)
Section 8
          (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this , no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
Section 8
Section 8(d).
Section 8(d)
Section 8
 
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
Section 8
          (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.

          . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Global Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
9. Termination
          . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
10. Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
          If, on the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall
provided
Section 10
 
terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Securities to be sold on such Option Closing Date or (ii) purchase not less than the aggregate principal amount of Additional Securities that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
          If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
          . (a) This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the preparation of any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.
11. Entire Agreement
          (b) The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Securities: (i) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (ii) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.
          . This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
12. Counterparts

          Section 3.02. . In case one or more Events of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body), then, and in each and every such case (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 3.01(h) with respect to the Company (and not solely with respect to a Significant Subsidiary of the Company, or a group of Subsidiaries of the Company that in aggregate would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Company), unless the principal of all of the Notes shall have already become due and payable (or waived), either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Noteholders), may declare 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest and accrued and unpaid Additional Interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall automatically be immediately due and payable, anything in this Indenture or in the Notes contained to the contrary notwithstanding.
Acceleration
If an Event of Default specified in Section 3.01(h) with respect to the Company (and not solely with respect to a Significant Subsidiary of the Company, or a group of Subsidiaries of the Company that in aggregate would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the Company) occurs and is continuing, the principal of all the Notes and accrued and unpaid interest and accrued and unpaid Additional Interest, if any, shall be immediately due and payable. This provision, however, is subject to the conditions that if, at any time after the principal of the Notes shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the monies due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay installments of accrued and unpaid interest and accrued and unpaid Additional Interest, if any, upon all Notes and the principal of any and all Notes that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on overdue installments of accrued and unpaid interest and accrued and unpaid Additional Interest, if any (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law), and on such principal at the rate borne by the Notes at such time) and amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to Section 6.06 of the Base Indenture, then and in every such case the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may waive all Defaults or Events of Default with respect to the Notes (other than a Default or an Event of Default resulting from a failure to repurchase any Notes when required upon a Fundamental Change or a failure to deliver, upon conversion, cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as applicable, due upon conversion) and rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences (other than a declaration or consequences, as the case may be, resulting from a failure to repurchase any Notes when required upon a Fundamental Change or a failure to deliver, upon conversion, cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as applicable, due upon conversion) and such Default (other than a Default resulting from a failure to repurchase any Notes when required upon a Fundamental Change or a failure to deliver, upon conversion, cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as applicable, due upon conversion) shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom (other than a
 
Default resulting from a failure to repurchase any Notes when required upon a Fundamental Change or a failure to deliver, upon conversion, cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as applicable, due upon conversion) shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent Default or Event of Default, or shall impair any right consequent thereon.
          Section 3.03. . Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture or in the Notes to the contrary, if the Company so elects, the sole remedy of Noteholders for an Event of Default relating to any obligation to file reports as required under Section 7.03 of the Base Indenture shall, for the first 180 days after the occurrence of such an Event of Default which will be the 90th day after written notice is provided to the Company in accordance with Section 3.01(c)), consist exclusively of the right to receive Additional Interest on the Notes at an annual rate equal to (x) 0.25% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes for the first 90 days an Event of Default is continuing in such 180-day period and (y) 0.50% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes for the remaining 90 days an Event of Default is continuing in such 180-day period. Additional Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date following the occurrence of such Event of Default in the same manner as regular interest on the Notes. The Company may elect to pay Additional Interest as the sole remedy under this Section 3.03 by giving notice to the holders, the Trustee and Paying Agent of such election on or before the close of business on the 5th Business Day after the date on which such Event of Default otherwise would occur. If the Company fails to timely give such notice or pay Additional Interest, the Notes will be immediately subject to acceleration as provided in Section 3.02. On the 181st day after such Event of Default (if such violation is not cured or waived prior to such 181st day), the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided in Section 3.02. This Section 3.03 shall not affect the rights of the Noteholders in the event of the occurrence of any other Event of Default. In the event the Company does not elect to pay Additional Interest upon an Event of Default in accordance with this Section, the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided in Section 3.02. Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of interest on, or in respect of, any Note, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of "Additional Interest" provided for in this Section 3.03 to the extent that, in such context, Additional Interest is, was or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of such sections, and express mention of the payment of Additional Interest (if applicable) in any provision shall not be construed as excluding Additional Interest in those provisions where such express mention is not made.
Additional Interest
          Section 3.04. . If an Event of Default under clause (a) or (b) of Section 3.01 shall have occurred and be continuing, the Company shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, the whole amount then due and payable on the Notes for principal and interest and Additional Interest, if any, with interest on any overdue principal, interest and Additional Interest, if any, at the rate borne by the Notes at such time, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover any amounts due to the Trustee under Section 6.06 of the Base Indenture. If the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Notes and collect the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner

To the extent that such payment of reasonable compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements out of the estate in any such proceedings shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, monies, securities and other property that the holders of the Notes may be entitled to receive in such proceedings, whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Noteholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Noteholder or the rights of any Noteholder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Noteholder in any such proceeding.
 
All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the Notes, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Notes.
In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and in any proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee shall be held to represent all the holders of the Notes, and it shall not be necessary to make any holders of the Notes parties to any such proceedings.
In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such waiver or rescission and annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company, the Noteholders, and the Trustee shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company, the Noteholders, and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

     Fourth, to the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company.

If the Company delivers a Settlement Notice electing to pay and deliver, as the case may be, a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock in respect of its Conversion Obligation but does not indicate a Specified Dollar Amount in such Settlement Notice, the Specified Dollar Amount shall be deemed to be equal to $1,000.
     (iv) The Settlement Amount in respect of any conversion of Notes shall be computed as follows:
     (A) if the Company elects to satisfy its Conversion Obligation in respect of such conversion by delivering solely Common Stock, the Company will deliver to the converting Noteholder a number of shares of Common Stock equal to (1)(i) the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be converted, (ii) $1,000, (2) the then-applicable Conversion Rate;
divided by
multiplied by
     (B) if the Company elects to satisfy its Conversion Obligation in respect of such conversion by paying solely cash, the Company shall pay to the converting Noteholder, cash in an amount per $1,000 principal amount of Notes being converted equal to the sum of the Daily Conversion Values for each of the forty consecutive Trading Days during the related Cash Settlement Averaging Period; and
     (C) if the Company elects to satisfy its Conversion Obligation in respect of such conversion by paying and delivering, as the case may be, a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, the Company shall pay and deliver to the converting Noteholder, as the case may be, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Notes being converted, a Settlement Amount equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amounts for each of the forty consecutive Trading Days during the related Cash Settlement Averaging Period.
     (v) The Company will also deliver to each converting Noteholder cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock as set forth pursuant to clause (l) below.
     (vi) The Daily Settlement Amounts (if applicable) and the Daily Conversion Values (if applicable) shall be determined by the Company promptly following the last day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period. Promptly after such determination of the Daily Settlement Amounts or the Daily Conversion Values, as the case may be, and the amount of cash deliverable in lieu of fractional shares (if any), the Company shall notify the Trustee and the Conversion Agent of the Daily Settlement Amounts or the Daily Conversion Values, as the case may be, and the amount of cash deliverable in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock. The Trustee and the Conversion Agent shall have no responsibility for any such determination.
     (c) [Reserved]
 
          (d) Before any holder of a Note shall be entitled to convert the same as set forth above, such holder shall (i) in the case of a Global Note, comply with the procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time and, if required, pay funds equal to the amount of interest and Additional Interest, if any, payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 5.02(j) and, if required, all transfer or similar taxes, if any, and (ii) in the case of a Note issued in certificated form, (1) complete and manually sign and deliver an irrevocable notice to the Conversion Agent in the form on the reverse of such certificated Note (or a facsimile thereof) (Exhibit B hereto) (a "") at the office of the Conversion Agent and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Notes to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for any shares of Common Stock, if any, to be delivered upon settlement of the Conversion Obligation to be registered, (2) surrender such Notes, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank (and accompanied by appropriate endorsement and transfer documents), at the office of the Conversion Agent, (3) if required, pay funds equal to interest (including additional interest, if any) payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 5.02(j), (4) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, and (5) if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes, if any as set forth in Section 5.02(g). The Trustee (and if different, the relevant Conversion Agent) shall notify the Company of any conversion pursuant to this Article 5 on the date of such conversion. No Notice of Conversion with respect to any Notes may be surrendered by a holder thereof if such holder has also delivered a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice to the Company in respect of such Notes and not validly withdrawn such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice in accordance with Section 6.03, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price.
Notice of Conversion
If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes, if any, that shall be payable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.
          (e) A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the "") that the holder has complied with the requirements set forth in clause (d) of this Section 5.02. The Company shall pay or deliver, as the case may be, such cash and/or shares of Common Stock on the third Trading Day immediately following the last Trading Day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period; , that if the Company elects to fulfill its Conversion Obligation solely in shares of Common Stock, the Company shall deliver such Common Stock on the third Trading Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date; , , that if prior to the relevant Conversion Date, the Common Stock has been replaced by Reference Property consisting solely of cash, pursuant to Section 5.06(b), the Company shall pay such cash on the third Trading Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any information required to calculate the Conversion Obligation is not available as of the applicable settlement date, the Company will deliver the additional shares of Common Stock resulting from such adjustment on the third Trading Day after the earliest Trading Day on which such calculation can be made. If application of the provisions described above would result in settlement of a conversion during the 10 Trading Days immediately following the Effective Date of a Fundamental Change, settlement will instead take place on the tenth Trading Day following the relevant Effective Date. If any shares of Common Stock are due to converting Noteholders, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued, and deliver to the Conversion Agent or to such Noteholder, or such Noteholder's nominee or nominees, certificates or a book-entry transfer through the Depositary for the number of

full shares of Common Stock to which such Noteholder shall be entitled in satisfaction of such Conversion Obligation.
          (f) In case any Note shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of the Note so surrendered, without charge to such holder, a new Note or Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Note.
          (g) If a holder submits a Note for conversion, the Company shall pay all stamp and other duties, if any, that may be imposed by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock, if any, upon the conversion. However, the holder shall pay any such tax that is due because the holder requests any shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the holder's name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax that will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
          (h) Except as provided in Section 5.04, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares of Common Stock issued upon the conversion of any Note as provided in this Article.
          (i) Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Note, the Trustee, or the Custodian at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such Global Note as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of Notes effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
          (j) Upon conversion, a Noteholder shall not receive any additional cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, except as set forth below. The Company's settlement of the Conversion Obligations pursuant to Section 5.02 shall be deemed to satisfy its obligation to pay the principal amount of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to, but not including, the Conversion Date. As a result, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, to, but not including, the Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a Interest Record Date, holders of such Notes as of the close of business on the Interest Record Date will receive the interest and Additional Interest, if any, payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Interest Record Date to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest and Additional Interest, if any, payable on the Notes so converted; , , that no such payment shall be required (1) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after a Interest Record Date but on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, (2) to the extent of any Defaulted Interest, if any, existing at the time of conversion with respect to such Note or (3) if the Notes are surrendered for conversion after the close of business on the Interest Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date. Except as set forth in this Section 5.02(j), no payment or adjustment will be made for accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, if any, on converted Notes.

          (k) The Person in whose name the certificate for any shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record as of the close of business on the relevant Conversion Date (if the Company elects to satisfy the related Conversion Obligation solely in shares of Common Stock) or the last Trading Day of the related Cash Settlement Averaging Period (in the case of any other Settlement Method), as the case may be; , , if such Conversion Date or such last Trading Day of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period occurs on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, such occurrence shall not be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive any such shares of Common Stock due upon conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such occurrence shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open. Upon conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Noteholder.

          (l) For each Note surrendered for conversion, if the Company has elected to deliver a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock in respect of its Conversion Obligation, the number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate Daily Settlement Amounts for the applicable Cash Settlement Averaging Period and any fractional shares remaining after such computation shall be paid in cash. If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered. The Company shall not issue fractional shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Notes. Instead, the Company shall pay cash in lieu of fractional shares based on the Daily VWAP on the relevant Conversion Date (if the Company elects to satisfy its Conversion Obligation solely in shares of Common Stock) or based on the Daily VWAP on the last Trading Day of the relevant Cash Settlement Averaging Period (in the case of any other Settlement Method).

     (ii) if the actual Stock Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is greater than $130.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Price as provided in clause (iii) below), or if the actual Stock Price of such Make-Whole Fundamental Change is less than $25.74 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Price as provided in clause (iii) below), then the Make-Whole Conversion Rate Adjustment shall be equal to zero and this Section 5.03 shall not require the Company to increase the Conversion Rate with respect to such Make-Whole Fundamental Change;

          (b) As soon as practicable after the Company determines the anticipated Effective Date of any proposed Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Company shall mail to each Noteholder, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent written notice of, and shall issue a press release indicating, and publicly announce, through a public medium that is customary for such announcements, and publish on the Company's website, the anticipated Effective Date of such proposed Make-Whole Fundamental Change and shall use commercially reasonable efforts in time to give such notice fifty Business Days in advance of such anticipated Effective Date. Each such press release notice, announcement and publication shall also state that in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Company shall increase, in accordance herewith, the Conversion Rate applicable to Notes entitled as provided herein to such increase (along with a description of how such increase shall be calculated and the time periods during which Notes must be surrendered in order to be entitled to such increase). No later than five Business Days after the actual Effective Date of each Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Company shall mail to each Noteholder, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent written notice of, and shall issue a press release indicating, and publicly announce, through a public medium that is customary for such announcements, and publish on the Company's website, such Effective Date and the amount by which the Conversion Rate has been so increased.
Nothing in this Section 5.03 shall prevent an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 5.04 in respect of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change.
          Section 5.04. . The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
Adjustment of Conversion Rate
          (a) If the Company issues solely shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on all or substantially all of the shares of Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination of the Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or the effective date for such share split or share combination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 5.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not split or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or split or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, share split or share combination had not been declared or announced.
          (b) If the Company distributes to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any rights, options or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than sixty days from the record date for such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock, at a price per share less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where
 
Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights, options or warrants are distributed and shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. To the extent that shares of the Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution had not been fixed.
For purposes of this Section 5.04(b), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for each Trading Day in the applicable ten-consecutive-Trading Day period, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors. In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 5.04(b).
          (c) If the Company shall distribute shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other of its assets or property other than (i) dividends or distributions (including share splits) covered by Section 5.04(a) or Section 5.04(b), (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash, and (iii) Spin-Offs to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 5.04(c) shall apply to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; that if "FMV" as set forth above is equal to or greater than "SP" as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provisions shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive on conversion in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes held by such holder, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate, the amount and kind of Distributed Property such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the Record Date for such distribution. If such distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines "FMV" for purposes of this Section 5.04(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any Notes, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution.

With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 5.04(c) where there has been a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (a ""), the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
where
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph of this Section 5.04(c) shall be made immediately after the opening of business on the day after the last day of the Valuation Period, but shall become effective as of the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off. If
 
the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off is less than ten Trading Days prior to, and including, the end of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period in respect of any conversion references within this Section 5.04(c) to ten Trading Days shall be deemed replaced, for purposes of calculating the affected daily Conversion Rates in respect of that conversion, with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off to, and including, the last Trading Day of such Cash Settlement Averaging Period. For purposes of determining the applicable Conversion Rate, in respect of any conversion during the ten Trading Days commencing on the Ex- Dividend Date of any Spin-Off, references in the portion of this Section 5.04(c) related to Spin-Offs to ten Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for such Spin-Off to, but excluding, the Conversion Date for such conversion.
Subject in all respect to Section 5.10, rights, options or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of its Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 5.04 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 5.04 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 5.04(c). If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights, options or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Supplemental Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different Notes, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Dividend Date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights, options or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 5.04 was made, (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
Trigger Event
 
For purposes of this Section 5.04(c), Section 5.04(a), and Section 5.04(b), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 5.04(c) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 5.04(b) applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights, options or warrants to which Section 5.04(c) applies (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 5.04(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights, options or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 5.04(a) and Section 5.04(b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the Ex-Dividend Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the Ex-Dividend Date," "the Ex-Dividend Date relating to such distribution of such rights, options or warrants" and "the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution" within the meaning of Section 5.04(a) and Section 5.04(b) and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or the effective date of such share split or share combination, as the case may be" within the meaning of Section 5.04(a) or "outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution" within the meaning of Section 5.04(b).
In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 5.04(c).
          (d) If any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution; that if "C" as set forth above is equal to or greater
provided
 
than "SP" as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive on the date on which the relevant cash dividend or distribution is distributed to holders of Common Stock, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, the amount of cash such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date for such distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.

For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 5.04(d), in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Notes become convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this Section 5.04(d), references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Last Reported Sale Prices of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Notes are then convertible equal to the numbers of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification. The above provisions of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications.
In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 5.04(d).
          (e) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for the Common Stock and if the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of the Common Stock exceeds the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading-Day period commencing on, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Expiration Date
where
 
Such adjustment under this Section 5.04(e) shall become effective at the opening of business on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date. If the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date is less than ten Trading Days prior to, and including, the end of the Cash Settlement Averaging Period in respect of any conversion, references within this Section 5.04(e) to ten Trading Days shall be deemed replaced, for purposes of calculating the affected daily Conversion Rates in respect of that conversion, with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date to, and including, the last Trading Day of such Cash Settlement Averaging Period. For purposes of determining the applicable Conversion Rate, in respect of any conversion during the ten Trading Days commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date, references within this Section 5.04(e) to ten Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date to, but excluding, the Conversion Date for such conversion. If the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any or all or any portion of such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had been made only in respect of the purchases that had been effected. In no event shall the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section 5.04(e).
          (f) The term "" means, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock (or other security) have the right to receive any cash, Notes or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, Notes or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, Notes or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
Record Date
          (g) Except as stated herein, the Company shall not adjust the Conversion Rate for the issuance of shares of its Common Stock or any Notes convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its Common Stock or the right, option or warrant to purchase shares of its Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable Notes.
          (h) Notwithstanding this Section 5.04 or any other provision of this Indenture or the Notes, if any Conversion Rate adjustment becomes effective, or any Ex-Dividend Date for any issuance, dividend or distribution (relating to a required Conversion Rate adjustment) occurs, during the period beginning on, and including, the open of business on a Conversion Date and ending on, and including, (x) the close of business on the third Trading Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date (if the Company elects to satisfy the related Conversion Obligation solely in shares of Common Stock) or (y) the close of business on the last Trading Day of a related Cash Settlement Averaging Period (in the case of any other Settlement Method), the Board of Directors shall make adjustments to the Conversion Rate and the amount of cash or number of shares of Common Stock
 
issuable upon conversion of the Notes, as the case may be, as are necessary or appropriate to effect the intent of this Section 5.04 and the other provisions of this Article 5 and to avoid unjust or inequitable results, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 5.04(h) shall apply in lieu of the adjustment or other term that would otherwise be applicable.
          (i) In addition to those required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 5.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least twenty Business Days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. In addition, the Company may also (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to the holder of each Note at its last address appearing on the Note Register provided for in Section 3.05 of the Base Indenture a notice of the increase at least fifteen days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
          (j) The Company shall not take any action that would result in adjustment of the Conversion Rate, pursuant to this Article 5, in such a manner as to result in the reduction of the Conversion Price to less than the par value per share of Common Stock.
          (k) The applicable Conversion Rate will not be adjusted:
     (i) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's Notes and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of the Common Stock under any plan;
     (ii) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of, or assumed by, the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries;
     (iii) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in clause (ii) of this subsection and outstanding as of the date the Notes were first issued;
     (iv) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock;
     (v) for accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Interest, if any; or
     (vi) for any transactions described in this Section 5.04 if Noteholders participate (as a result of holding the Notes, and at the same time as holders of Common Stock participate) in such transactions as if such Noteholders held a number shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate at the time such adjustment would be required, multiplied by the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Notes held by such Noteholder, without having to convert their Notes.
 
          (l) All calculations and other determinations under this Article 5 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share.
          (m) The Company shall not be required to make an adjustment in the Conversion Rate unless the adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate. However, the Company shall carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate and make such carried forward adjustment, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1%, (i) upon any conversion of Notes, and (ii) on each of the forty-two Scheduled Trading Days immediately preceding the Maturity Date.
          (n) Except as set forth in this Article 5, the Company shall not adjust the Conversion Rate.
          (o) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the holder of each Note at its last address appearing on the Note Register provided for in Section 3.05 of the Base Indenture, within ten days of the effective date of such adjustment. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
          (p) If, in respect of any Trading Day within the Cash Settlement Averaging Period for a converted Note:
     (i) shares of Common Stock are deliverable with respect to the Daily Settlement Amount for such Trading Day in accordance with this Article 5;
     (ii) any event that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under any of clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 5.04 has not resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate as of such Trading Day; and
     (iii) the shares of Common Stock the holder of such Note shall receive in respect of such Trading Day are not entitled to participate in the distribution or transaction giving rise to such adjustment event because, pursuant to the terms of Section 5.02(k), such shares were not held by such holder on the record date corresponding to such distribution or transaction,
then the Company will adjust the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable with respect to the Daily Settlement Amount for such Trading Day to reflect the relevant distribution or transaction.
          (q) If:
     (i) the Company elects to satisfy the Conversion Obligation solely in shares of Common Stock;
 
     (ii) any event that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under any of clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 5.04 has not resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate as of the Conversion Date; and
     (iii) the shares of Common Stock the holder of such Note shall receive on settlement are not entitled to participate in the distribution or transaction giving rise to such adjustment event because, pursuant to the terms of Section 5.02(k), such shares were not held by such holder on the record date corresponding to such distribution or transaction,
then the Company will adjust the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable with respect to the relevant Trading Day to reflect the relevant distribution or transaction.
          (r) For purposes of this Section 5.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company.
          (s) In the event that the Company adjusts the conversion rate pursuant to this Section 5.04, the Company shall notify the Trustee and issue a press release containing the relevant information (and make such press release available on the Company's website).
          Section 5.05. . The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion.

Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale
Merger Event
     (a) the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) permitted under Section 4.01(g) as set forth in this Supplemental Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article 5. If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other Notes and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, binding share exchange, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional
 
provisions to protect the interests of the holders of the Notes as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Article 6 herein.
     In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 5.06, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefor, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or asset that will comprise the Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Noteholders. The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Noteholder, at its address appearing on the Note Register provided for in this Indenture, within twenty days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
     (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.02(b), and subject to the provisions of Section 5.01 and Section 5.03, at and after the effective time of such Merger Event, (i) the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes into cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock at the Company's election as set forth in Section 5.02 will be changed to a right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of such Note into cash, the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive (the "") or a combination of cash and Reference Property at the Company's election and (ii) the related Conversion Obligation shall be settled as set forth under clause (c) below.
Reference Property
     (c) With respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes surrendered for conversion after the effective date of any such Merger Event, the Company's Conversion Obligation shall be settled in cash or units of Reference Property, at the Company's election, in accordance with Section 5.02(b) as follows:
     (i) (A) if the Company elects to satisfy its Conversion Obligation in respect of such conversion by delivering solely Reference Property, the Company shall deliver to the converting Noteholder a number of units of Reference Property (each such unit comprised of the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such Merger Event would have owned or been entitled to receive based on the Weighted Average Consideration) equal to (1) the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be converted, divided by $1,000, multiplied by (2) the then-applicable Conversion Rate; (B) if the Company elects to satisfy its Conversion Obligation in respect of such conversion by paying solely cash, the Company shall pay to the converting Noteholder cash in an amount, per $1,000 principal amount of Notes equal to the sum of the Daily Conversion Values for each of the forty consecutive Trading Days during the related Cash Settlement Averaging Period, such Daily Conversion Values determined as if the reference to "the Daily VWAP of the Common Stock" in definition thereof were instead a reference to "the Daily VWAP of a unit of Reference Property" comprised of the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such Merger Event would have owned or been entitled to receive based on the Weighted Average Consideration; and (C) if the Company elects to satisfy its Conversion Obligation through delivery of a combination of cash and Reference
 
Property, the Company shall deliver in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Notes being converted, a Settlement Amount equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amounts for each of the forty consecutive Trading Days during the Cash Settlement Averaging Period for such Note, such Daily Settlement Amounts determined as if the reference to "the Daily VWAP of the Common Stock" in definition of Daily Conversion Value and Daily Share Amount were instead a reference to "the Daily VWAP of a unit of Reference Property" comprised of the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such Merger Event would have owned or been entitled to receive based on the Weighted Average Consideration.
     (ii) The Company will deliver the cash in lieu of fractional units of Reference Property as set forth pursuant to Section 5.02(l) (that the amount of such cash shall be determined as if references in such Section to "the Daily VWAP of the Common Stock" were instead a reference to "the Daily VWAP of a unit of Reference Property" composed of the kind and amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such Merger Event would have owned or been entitled to receive based on the Weighted Average Consideration).
provided

     (v) The Company shall notify the holders and the Trustee of the Weighted Average Consideration as soon as practicable after the Weighted Average Consideration is determined.
          (d) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.
          (e) In the event that the Notes become convertible into Reference Property pursuant to this Section 5.06, the Company shall notify the Trustee and issue a press release containing the relevant information (and make such press release available on the Company's website).
          Section 5.07. .
Certain Covenants
 
          (a) The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Notes will be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.
          (b) The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued upon conversion, the Company will, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, secure such registration or approval, as the case may be.
          (c) The Company further covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on any national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Company will list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, any Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes.
          Section 5.08. . The Company hereby appoints the Trustee as the initial Conversion Agent, which appointment the Trustee accepts and agrees to perform in accordance with the terms of this Indenture. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Noteholder to determine the Conversion Rate (or any adjustment thereto) or whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment (including any increase) of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent ("") shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any Notes, property or cash that may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other Notes or property or cash upon the surrender of any Note for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 5.06 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or Notes or property (including cash) receivable by Noteholders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 5.06 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the Base Indenture, may accept (without any independent investigation) as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto. The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including without limitation its right to be compensated, reimbursed, and indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, including its capacity as Conversion Agent.

Notice to Noteholders Prior to Certain Actions

     (b) the Company shall authorize the granting to all of the holders of its Common Stock of rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights, options or warrants; or
     (c) of any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or
     (d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company;
the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Noteholder at its address appearing on the Note Register, provided for in Section 3.05 of the Base Indenture, as promptly as possible but in any event at least twenty days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (i) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights, options or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (ii) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for Notes or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.
          Section 5.10. . To the extent that the Company has a stockholder rights plan or other "poison pill" in effect upon conversion of the Notes, each share of Common Stock, if any, issued upon such conversion shall be entitled to receive the appropriate number of rights, if any, and the certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such conversion shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as may be provided by the terms of any such stockholder rights plan or poison pill, as the same may be amended from time to time. If, however, prior to the time of conversion, the rights have separated from the shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable stockholder rights agreement so that the holders of the Notes would not be entitled to receive any rights in respect of Common Stock, if any, issuable upon conversion of the Notes, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company has distributed to all holders of Common Stock, shares of Capital Stock of the Company, evidence of indebtedness or assets as provided in Section 5.04(c), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
Stockholder Rights Plans
          Section 5.11. . When a holder surrenders its Notes for conversion, the Company may, at its election, direct the Conversion Agent to surrender, on or prior

In order to accept any Notes surrendered for conversion for exchange in lieu of conversion, the Designated Institution must agree to timely deliver, in exchange for such Notes, the shares of Common stock and/or cash that would otherwise be due upon conversion pursuant to Section 5.02 and in respect of which the Company has notified converting Noteholders. If the Company makes the election provided for in this Section 5.11, the Company shall, by the close of business on the second Business Day following the relevant Conversion Date as part of its Settlement Notice, notify the holder surrendering its Notes for conversion that it has made such election. In addition, the Company shall concurrently notify the Designated Institution of the Settlement Method (and, if applicable, the Specified Dollar Amount) that Company has elected with respect to such conversion and the relevant deadline for delivery of the consideration due upon conversion. Any Notes exchanged by the Designated Institution will remain outstanding.
If the Designated Institution agrees to accept any Notes for exchange but does not timely deliver the related consideration due upon conversion to the Conversion Agent, or if the Designated Institution does not accept such Notes for exchange, the Company shall, within the time period specified in Section 5.02(e), convert such Notes into cash and/or shares of Common Stock, as applicable in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.02.
          
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the Company's designation of a Designated Institution pursuant to this Section 5.11 require the Designated Institution to accept any Notes for exchange.

Additional Termination Events
provided
     (i) Dealer reasonably determines that it is advisable to terminate a portion of the Transaction so that Dealer's related hedging activities will comply with applicable securities laws, rules or regulations or related policies and procedures of Dealer (whether or not such
 
requirements, policies or procedures are imposed by law or have been voluntarily adopted by Dealer), or Dealer, despite using commercially reasonable efforts, is unable or reasonably determines that it is impractical or illegal to hedge its obligations pursuant to this Transaction in the public market without registration under the Securities Act or as a result of any legal, regulatory or self-regulatory requirements; or
     (ii) at any time at which any Excess Ownership Position (as defined above) occurs, Dealer, in its discretion, is unable to effect a transfer or assignment to a third party of the Transaction or any other transaction between the parties after using its commercially reasonable efforts on pricing terms and within a time period reasonably acceptable to Dealer such that an Excess Ownership Position no longer exists; that Dealer shall treat only that portion of the Transaction as the Affected Transaction as necessary so that such Excess Ownership Position no longer exists; or
provided
     (iii) a "person" or "group" within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act other than Issuer or its subsidiaries files a Schedule TO or any schedule, form or report under the Exchange Act disclosing that such person or group has become the direct or indirect ultimate "beneficial owner," as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, of Issuer's common equity representing more than 50% of the voting power of Issuer's common equity; or
     (iv) consummation of any binding share exchange, exchange offer, tender offer, consolidation or merger of Issuer pursuant to which the Shares will be converted into cash, securities or other property or any sale, lease or other transfer in one transaction or a series of transactions of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of Issuer and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person other than one or more of Issuer's subsidiaries (any such exchange, offer, consolidation, merger, transaction or series of transactions being referred to herein as an ""); , , that any such event where the holders of more than 50% of the Shares immediately prior to such event own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of all classes of common equity of the continuing or surviving person or transferee or the parent thereof immediately after such event shall not be an Additional Termination Event; or

     (vi) Issuer's stockholders approve any plan or proposal for Issuer's liquidation or dissolution; or
     (vii) the Shares cease to be listed on at least one U.S. national securities exchange.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an event set forth in clause (iv) above will not constitute an Additional Termination Event if at least 90% of the consideration, excluding cash payments for fractional shares, in the transaction or event that would otherwise have constituted an Additional Termination Event consists of shares of common stock that are traded on at least one U.S. national securities exchange or that will be so traded when issued or exchanged in connection with the relevant transaction or event (these securities being referred to as "").
publicly traded securities

Continuing Director
 
     (k) . If, on or prior to the Effective Date, Dealer reasonably determines that it is advisable to cancel the Transaction because of concerns that Dealer's related hedging activities could be viewed as not complying with applicable securities laws, rules or regulations, the Transaction shall be cancelled and shall not become effective, and neither party shall have any obligation to the other party in respect of the Transaction.
Effectiveness
     (l) . Dealer may divide any Component into additional Components and designate the Expiration Date and the Number of Warrants for each such Component if Dealer determines, in a commercially reasonable manner, that such further division is necessary or advisable to preserve Dealer's hedging or hedge unwind activity hereunder in light of existing liquidity conditions in the cash market or stock loan market or to enable Dealer to effect purchases of Shares in connection with its hedging, hedge unwind or settlement activity hereunder in a manner that would, if Dealer were Issuer or an affiliated purchaser of Issuer, be compliance with applicable legal, regulatory and self-regulatory requirements, or with related policies and procedures applicable to Dealer.
Extension of Settlement
     (m) The provisions of Section 2(c) of the Agreement shall not apply to the Transaction.

Delivery of Cash
     (o) .

Payments by Dealer upon Early Termination
     (p) . This Confirmation and the Agreement may not be modified, amended or supplemented, except in a written instrument signed by Issuer and Dealer. If Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated exercises the underwriters' (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement) right under the Underwriting Agreement dated as of April 6, 2009, between Issuer and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. as managers for the underwriters party thereto, to purchase additional convertible notes as set forth therein, then Dealer and Issuer will either enter into a new confirmation evidencing a corresponding number of additional warrants to be issued by Issuer to Dealer or amend this Confirmation (in each case on pricing terms acceptable Dealer and Issuer) (such additional confirmation or amendment to this Confirmation to provide for the payment by Dealer to Issuer of the additional premium related thereto in an amount to be agreed between the parties).
Amendment
     (q) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Confirmation to the contrary requiring or allowing Dealer to purchase, sell, receive or deliver any Shares or other securities to or from Issuer, Dealer may designate any of its affiliates to purchase, sell, receive or deliver such Shares or other securities and otherwise to perform Dealer's obligations in respect of the Transaction and any such designee may assume such obligations. Dealer shall be discharged of its obligations to Issuer to the extent of any such performance.
Designation by Dealer.
     (r) . This Confirmation may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
