     On April 24, 2009 BWA Receivables Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BorgWarner Inc., as borrower, BorgWarner Inc., Windmill Funding Corporation and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, as the bank thereunder and as the agent for Windmill Funding Corporation, entered into the Fifth Amendment dated as of April 24, 2009 to Second Amended and Restated Receivables Loan Agreement (the "Receivables Line Amendment"). The Receivables Line Amendment extended the maturity date of the Second Amended and Restated Receivables Loan Agreement to April 27, 2009. On such maturity date, all loans outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated Receivables Loan Agreement were re-paid in full and the Second Amended and Restated Receivables Loan Agreement expired on its stated maturity date pursuant to its terms.
A. 
     The description of the Receivables Line Amendment herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by this reference.
     On April 30, 2009, BorgWarner Inc. amended its Credit Agreement dated July 22, 2004 pursuant to an Amendment No. 1 and Consent Agreement dated as of April 30, 2009 among BorgWarner Inc., as borrower, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, the Co-Syndication Agents named therein, the Documentation Agents named therein and the Lenders parties thereto.
B. 
     The amendment to the credit agreement extends the maturity date of the credit agreement from July 22, 2009 to January 22, 2011. After July 22, 2009, the amount of the credit facility will be not less than $250 million and may be increased to $300 million. BorgWarner's indebtedness under the credit agreement and under certain treasury management, interest protection and other hedging arrangements has been guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries and such indebtedness will be secured by unperfected pledges of its equity interests in its subsidiaries and by unperfected security interests in all present and future machinery and equipment, inventory and other goods, accounts receivables and inter-company debt (subject to certain restrictions thereon to comply with the borrower's existing bond indentures). No secured party is entitled to perfect its lien on any of the collateral until such time as the long term unsecured senior, non-credit enhanced debt rating of the borrower is less than or equal to BB+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group and less than or equal to Ba1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
     Under the terms of the amended credit agreement, subject to terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the lenders under the amended credit agreement, (i) the borrower and its domestic subsidiaries may undertake receivables financings in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $50 million at any one time outstanding (which amount may be increased to up t o$100 million under certain conditions) and (ii) the borrower and its foreign subsidiaries may undertake receivables financings in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed EUR50 million at any one time outstanding. At the present time neither the borrower nor any of its subsidiaries has undertaken any of such receivables financing and there can be no assurance that the borrower or any of its subsidiaries will undertake any such receivable financing.
     The amended credit agreement includes financial covenants that require the borrower (i) to maintain a consolidated net worth that is not less than the sum of (x) 85% of the consolidated net worth of the borrower as of March 31, 2009, (y) 25% of the cumulative consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter of the borrower (beginning with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2009) for which consolidated net income is positive, and (z) 100% of the net cash proceeds of any common equity interests issued by the borrower after April 30, 2009, (ii) to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (i.e., as at the date of determination, the ratio of consolidated EBITDA for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of the borrower ending on such date to consolidated interest charges for such period), and (iii) to maintain a
 
consolidated leverage ratio (i.e., as at the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of the borrower, the ratio of consolidated net debt on such day to consolidated EBITDA for such period) of not more than the ratio set forth below opposite such period:
The descriptions of (i) the Amendment No.1 and Consent Agreement dated as of April 30 ,2009 among BorgWarner Inc., as borrower, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, the Co-Syndication Agents named therein, the Documentation Agents named therein and the Lenders parties thereto ("Amendment No. 1"), (ii) the Credit Agreement dated July 22, 2004 as amended by Amendment No. 1 (the "Amended Credit Agreement") and (iii) the guarantee of the borrower's indebtedness by certain of its subsidiaries (the "Guaranty") are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of Amendment No.1, the Amended Credit Agreement, and the Guaranty, the forms of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, respectively, and are incorporated herein by this reference.

The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Issuing Bank.
     (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Borrowing of ABR Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the Issuing Bank an LC Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which LC Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate applicable to ABR Loans (including the Applicable Rate) plus 2%.

provided
however
     (vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.6(c) by the time specified in Section 2.6(c)(ii), the Issuing Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Bank at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Issuing Bank in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Issuing Bank in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or LC Advance in respect of the relevant LC Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of the Issuing Bank submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.6(c)(vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.
     (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.6(c)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 9.16 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Issuing Bank in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

     (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;
     (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;
     (iv) any payment by the Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the Issuing Bank under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any bankruptcy or other debtor relief law; or
     (v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might
 
otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.
The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the Issuing Bank. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the Issuing Bank and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.
          (f) . Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Issuing Bank shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Issuing Bank shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.6(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence or the Issuing Bank's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings. The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Bank and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America.

          (d) A Non-Extending Lender shall be obligated, at the request of the Borrower and subject to payment by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Non-Extending Lender of the principal amount of, and accrued interest on, such Lender's Loans, together with any fees or other amounts owing to such Lender under this Agreement, to transfer without recourse, representation or warranty (other than good title to its Loans), Extending Lender, at any time prior to the Maturity Date applicable to such Non-Extending Lender, all of its rights and obligations hereunder to another financial institution or group of financial institutions nominated by the Borrower and willing to participate in the Commitments in the place of such Non-Extending Lender; that, if such transferee is not a Lender, such transferee(s) satisfies all the requirements of this Agreement and the Administrative Agent shall have consented to such transfer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Each such transferee shall become a Continuing Lender hereunder in replacement of the Non-Extending Lender, with the Maturity Date applicable to such Continuing Lender's Commitments being the Extended Maturity Date, and shall enjoy all rights and assume all obligations on the part of the Lenders set forth in this Agreement. Simultaneously with such transfer, each such transferee shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a written agreement assuming
provided
 
all obligations of the Lenders set forth in this Agreement, which agreement shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Administrative Agent.
          (e) If the Maturity Date shall have been extended in respect of the Continuing Lenders in accordance with Section 2.7(a) any notice of borrowing pursuant to Section 2.3 or 2.5 specifying a borrowing date occurring after the Maturity Date applicable to a Non-Extending Lender or requesting an Interest Period extending beyond such date (a) shall have no effect in respect of such Non-Extending Lender and (b) shall not specify a requested aggregate principal amount exceeding the total applicable Commitments.
          SECTION 2.8 .
Funding of Borrowings
          (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of Same Day Funds by 2:00 p.m., New York City time, in the case of any Loan denominated in Dollars, and by the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent, in the case of any Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.5. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.6(c) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.
provided
          (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, in Same Day Funds at (i) in the case of such Lender, the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate on the applicable Borrowing. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
          SECTION 2.9 .
Interest Elections
          (a) Each Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars initially shall be of the Type and under the Facility specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of
 
a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
          (b) Each Revolving Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in the applicable Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to continue such Borrowing and may elect Interest Periods thereafter, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different Interest Periods with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
          (c) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone or by electronic communication (if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Administrative Agent) by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.3 if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy or by electronic communication (if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Administrative Agent) to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.
          (d) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.2:
     (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
     (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
     (iii) in the case of Borrowings denominated in Dollars, whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
 
     (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
          (e) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
          (f) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period (i) such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing if it is denominated in Dollars or (ii) such Borrowing shall be continued as such for an Interest Period of one month if it is denominated in an Alternative Currency. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing, (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency may be continued as such for an Interest Period of one month.

          (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Dollar Commitments; that (i) each reduction of the Dollar Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Dollar Commitments if, (A) after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans, the Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments or (B) the Dollar Commitments as so reduced would be less than the aggregate Euro Commitments, Sterling Commitments or Yen Commitments.
provided

Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of any Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of any Commitments shall be made ratably among the applicable Lenders in accordance with their respective applicable Commitments.

          SECTION 2.11 .
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt
          (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the Maturity Date.

prima
facie
provided
 
such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans and other Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
          (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.4) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

Alternate Rate of Interest
 
          (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, as applicable, for the relevant currency for such Interest Period; or
          (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders or by the holders of at least a majority of the Commitments under a Facility that the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be ineffective, (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain ABR Loans as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to the Eurocurrency Rate shall be suspended, but during such period ABR Loans shall be made and continued based on the interest rate determined by the greater of clauses (a) and (b) in the definition of Alternate Base Rate, and (iii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing, if denominated in Dollars, shall be made as an ABR Borrowing (with the interest rate determined by the greater of clauses (a) and (b) in the definition of Alternate Base Rate) and, if denominated in an Alternative Currency, shall be made as a Borrowing bearing interest at an interest rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent, after consultation with the Borrower and the applicable Lenders, to compensate the applicable Lenders for such Borrowing in such currency for the applicable period.

Increased Costs
          (a) If any Change in Law shall:
     (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except (A) any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate and (B) the requirements of the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank reflected in the Mandatory Cost, other than as set forth below) or the Issuing Bank;
     (ii) result in the failure of the Mandatory Cost, as calculated hereunder, to represent the cost to any Lender of complying with the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank in relation to its making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Loans; or
 
     (iii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
          (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
          (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Revolving Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.12(b) and is revoked in accordance herewith) or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.20, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period, over (ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such Lender) for dollar deposits from other banks in the Eurocurrency market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth (i) any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section and (ii) the calculations used to arrive at such amount shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
          SECTION 2.18 .
Taxes
          (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
          (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
          (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
 
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
          (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
          (f) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, each Lender and the Issuing Bank shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, against any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Borrower or the Administrative Agent by any Governmental Authority as a result of the failure by such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to deliver, or as a result of the inaccuracy, inadequacy or deficiency of, any documentation required to be delivered by such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (e). Each Lender and the Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this subsection (f). The agreements in this subsection (f) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the Issuing Bank, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.
          SECTION 2.19 .
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
          (a) All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or under Section 2.16, 2.17 or 2.18, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York, New York time (or as specified in the next sentence in the case of Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency), on the date when due, in Same Day Funds, without set off or counterclaim. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder with respect to principal and
 
interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made on the dates specified herein for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower by the same time at least one Business Day prior to the date when due. If, for any reason, the Borrower is prohibited by law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Amount of the Alterative Currency payment amount. All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 12:00 p.m., New York City time, in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.16, 2.17, 2.18 and 9.3 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments made by the Borrower hereunder shall be made in the applicable currency, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph.
          (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties, (iii) third, to pay all other Obligations (other than Obligations then owing under Secured Hedge Agreements and Secured Cash Management Agreements), ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amount of such Obligations then due to such parties, (iv) fourth, to pay that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid amounts owing under Secured Hedge Agreements and Secured Cash Management Agreements, ratably among the Hedge Banks and the Cash Management Banks entitled thereto in accordance with the amount of such Obligations then due to such parties, and (v) fifth, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank, to Cash Collateralize that portion of LC Exposures comprised of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit. Subject to Section 2.6(c), amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to subclause (v) of the preceding sentence shall be applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, Obligations arising under Secured Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements shall be excluded from the application described above if either (a) no Default has occurred and is continuing at such time or (b) the Administrative Agent has not received written notice thereof, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Cash Management
 
Bank or Hedge Bank, as the case may be. Each Cash Management Bank or Hedge Bank not a party to the Credit Agreement that has given the notice contemplated by the preceding sentence shall, by such notice, be deemed to have acknowledged and accepted the appointment of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms of Article VIII hereof for itself and its Affiliates as if a "Lender" party hereto.
          (c) Except to the extent that this Agreement provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender or to the Lenders under a particular Facility, if any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the applicable Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect.
          (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.5(c), 2.6(c) or (d), 2.8(b) or 2.19(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter
 
received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
          (f) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 9.3(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 9.3(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 9.3(c).
          SECTION 2.20 .
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
          (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.16, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.18, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.18, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
          (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.16, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.18, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.4), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Dollar Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the related Loan Documents, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.16 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.18, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments, and (iv) (a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 9.4(b). A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
 
          SECTION 2.21 .
Increase in Commitments

At the time of sending such notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders).

provided
          (b) . Each Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Applicable Percentage of such requested increase. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment.
Lender Elections to Increase
          (c) . The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders' responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Swing Line Lender (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.
Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders

If the aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective date (the "") and the final allocation of such increase.

The Borrower shall prepay any Revolving Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.17) to the extent
