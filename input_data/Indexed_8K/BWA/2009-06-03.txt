provided
     (e) In the event such Grantor shall fail to maintain, or fail to cause to be maintained, the full insurance coverage required hereunder or shall fail to keep any of its Collateral in good repair and good operating condition, the Administrative Agent may (but shall be under no obligation to), without waiving or releasing any Secured Obligation or Default or Event of Default by such Grantor hereunder, contract for the required policies of insurance and pay the premiums on the same or make any required repairs, renewals and replacements; and all sums so disbursed by Administrative Agent, including reasonable charges and disbursements of counsel, court costs, expenses and other charges related thereto, shall be payable on demand by such Grantor to the Administrative Agent, shall be additional Secured Obligations secured by the Collateral, and (in addition to other rights and remedies resulting from such nonpayment) shall bear

Section 2.14(e)
     (f) Each Grantor agrees that to the extent that it shall fail to maintain, or fail to cause to be maintained, the full insurance coverage required by Section 10(a), it shall in the event of any loss or casualty pay promptly to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, to be held in a separate account for application in accordance with the provisions of Sections 10(h), such amount as would have been received as Net Proceeds (as hereinafter defined) by the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, under the provisions of Section 10(h) had such insurance been carried to the extent required.
     (g) The Net Proceeds of any liability insurance carried pursuant to the provisions of Section 10(a) shall be applied by such Grantor toward satisfaction of the claim or liability with respect to which such insurance proceeds may be paid.
     (h) The Net Proceeds of casualty insurance carried with respect to the Collateral pursuant to the provisions of Section 10(a) hereof shall be paid to such Grantor and held by such Grantor in a separate account and applied, as long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, as follows: after any loss under any such insurance and payment of the proceeds of such insurance, each Grantor shall have a period of 30 days after payment of the insurance proceeds with respect to such loss to elect to either (x) repair or replace the Collateral so damaged, (y) deliver such Net Proceeds to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, as additional Collateral or (z) apply such Net Proceeds to the acquisition of tangible assets constituting Collateral used or useful in the conduct of the business of such Grantor, subject to the provisions of this Security Agreement. If such Grantor elects to repair or replace the Collateral so damaged, such Grantor agrees the Collateral shall be repaired to a condition substantially similar to or of better quality or higher value than its condition prior to damage or replaced with Collateral in a condition substantially similar to or of better quality or higher value than the condition of the Collateral so replaced prior to damage. At all times during which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive direct and immediate payment of the proceeds of such insurance and such Grantor shall take all action as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to accomplish such payment.

Subject to Section 10(d), each Grantor is hereby authorized and empowered to adjust or compromise any loss under any such insurance other than losses relating to claims made directly against any Secured Party as to which liability insurance described in Section 10(a) is applicable.
     (k) The provisions contained in this Security Agreement pertaining to insurance shall be cumulative with any additional provisions imposing additional insurance requirements under any of the Loan Documents.
     . Upon and after an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall have the following rights and remedies on behalf of the Secured Parties in addition to any rights and remedies set forth elsewhere in this Security Agreement or the other Loan Documents, all of which may be exercised with or, if allowed by law, without notice to a Grantor:
11. 
Rights and Remedies Upon Event of Default
     (a) All of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC or under other applicable law, all of which rights and remedies shall be cumulative, and none of which shall be exclusive, to the extent permitted by law, in addition to any other rights and remedies contained in this Security Agreement or any other Loan Document;
     (b) The right to foreclose the Liens and security interests created under this Security Agreement by any available judicial procedure or without judicial process;
     (c) The right to (i) enter upon the premises of a Grantor through self-help and without judicial process, without first obtaining a final judgment or giving such Grantor notice or opportunity for a hearing on the validity of the Administrative Agent's claim and without any obligation to pay rent to such Grantor, or any other place or places where any Collateral is located and kept, and remove the Collateral therefrom to the premises of the Administrative Agent or any agent of the Administrative Agent, for such time as the Administrative Agent may desire, in order effectively to collect or liquidate the Collateral, and (ii) require such Grantor or any bailee or other agent of such Grantor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Administrative Agent at a place to be designated by the Administrative Agent that is reasonably convenient to both parties;
     (d) The right to (i) exercise all of a Grantor's rights and remedies with respect to the collection of Accounts, including the right to demand payment thereof and enforce payment, by legal proceedings or otherwise; (ii) settle, adjust, compromise, extend or renew all or any Accounts or any legal proceedings pertaining thereto; (iii) discharge and release all or any Payment Collateral; (iv) take control, in any manner, of any item of payment or proceeds referred to in Section 5 above; (v) prepare, file and sign a Grantor's name on any Proof of Claim in bankruptcy, notice of Lien, assignment or satisfaction of Lien or similar document in any action or proceeding adverse to any obligor under any Payment Collateral or otherwise in connection with any Payment Collateral; (vi) endorse
 
the name of a Grantor upon any document, instrument, invoice, freight bill, bill of lading or similar document or agreement relating to any Collateral; (vii) use the information recorded on or contained on a Grantor's internet website or otherwise in any data processing equipment and computer hardware and software relating to any Collateral to which a Grantor has access; (viii) open such Grantor's mail and collect any and all amounts due to such Grantor from any Account Debtors or other obligor in respect of Payment Collateral; (ix) take over such Grantor's post office boxes or make other arrangements as the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, deems necessary to receive such Grantor's mail, including notifying the post office authorities to change the address for delivery of such Grantor's mail to such address as the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Secured Parties, may designate; (x) notify any or all Account Debtors or other obligor on any Payment Collateral that such Payment Collateral has been assigned to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and that Administrative Agent has a security interest therein for the benefit of the Secured Parties ( that the Administrative Agent may at any time give such notice to an Account Debtor that is a department, agency or authority of the United States government); each Grantor hereby agrees that any such notice, in the Administrative Agent's sole discretion, may (but need not) be sent on such Grantor's stationery, in which event such Grantor shall co-sign such notice with the Administrative Agent if requested to do so by the Administrative Agent; and (xi) do all acts and things and execute all documents necessary, in Administrative Agent's sole discretion, to collect the Payment Collateral; and
provided
     (e) The right to sell all or any Collateral in its then existing condition, or after any further manufacturing or processing thereof, at such time or times, at public or private sale or sales, with such notice as may be required by law, in lots or in bulk, for cash or on credit, with or without representations and warranties, all as the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, may deem advisable. The Administrative Agent shall have the right to conduct such sales on a Grantor's premises or elsewhere and shall have the right to use a Grantor's premises without charge for such sales for such time or times as the Administrative Agent may see fit. The Administrative Agent may, if it deems it reasonable, postpone or adjourn any sale of the Collateral from time to time by an announcement at the time and place of such postponed or adjourned sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Each Grantor agrees that the Administrative Agent has no obligation to preserve rights to the Collateral against prior parties or to marshal any Collateral for the benefit of any Person. The Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties is hereby granted an irrevocable fully paid license or other right (including each Grantor's rights under any license or any franchise agreement), each of which shall remain in full force and effect until the Facility Termination Date, to use, without charge, each of the labels, patents, copyrights, names, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks and advertising matter, or any property of a similar nature owned or licensed by any Grantor, as it pertains to the Collateral, in completing production of, advertising for sale and selling any Collateral. If any of the Collateral shall require repairs, maintenance, preparation or the like, or is in process or other unfinished state, the Administrative Agent shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to perform such repairs, maintenance, preparation, processing or completion of manufacturing for the purpose of putting the same in such
 
saleable form as the Administrative Agent shall deem appropriate, but the Administrative Agent shall have the right to sell or dispose of the Collateral without such processing and no Grantor shall have any claim against the Administrative Agent for the value that may have been added to such Collateral with such processing. In addition, each Grantor agrees that in the event notice is necessary under applicable law, written notice mailed to such Grantor in the manner specified herein ten (10) days prior to the date of public sale of any of the Collateral or prior to the date after which any private sale or other disposition of the Collateral will be made shall constitute commercially reasonable notice to such Grantor. All notice is hereby waived with respect to any of the Collateral which threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market. The Administrative Agent may purchase all or any part of the Collateral at public or, if permitted by law, private sale, free from any right of redemption which is hereby expressly waived by such Grantor and, in lieu of actual payment of such purchase price, may set off the amount of such price against the Secured Obligations. Each Grantor recognizes that the Administrative Agent may be unable to effect a public sale of certain of the Collateral by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""), and applicable state law, and may be otherwise delayed or adversely affected in effecting any sale by reason of present or future restrictions thereon imposed by governmental authorities (""), and that as a consequence of such prohibitions and restrictions the Administrative Agent may be compelled (i) to resort to one or more private sales to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire Affected Collateral for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof, or (ii) to seek regulatory approval of any proposed sale or sales, or (iii) to limit the amount of Affected Collateral sold to any Person or group. Each Grantor agrees and acknowledges that private sales so made may be at prices and upon terms less favorable to such Grantor than if such Affected Collateral was sold either at public sales or at private sales not subject to other regulatory restrictions, and that the Administrative Agent has no obligation to delay the sale of any Affected Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the Grantor or any other Person to register or otherwise qualify them under or exempt them from any applicable restriction, even if such Grantor or other Person would agree to register or otherwise qualify or exempt such Affected Collateral so as to permit a public sale under the Securities Act or applicable state law. Each Grantor further agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that the use of private sales made under the foregoing circumstances to dispose of Affected Collateral shall be deemed to be dispositions in a commercially reasonable manner. Each Grantor hereby acknowledges that a ready market may not exist for Affected Collateral that is not traded on a national securities exchange or quoted on an automated quotation system.
Securities Act
Affected Collateral
     The net cash proceeds resulting from the collection, liquidation, sale, or other disposition of the Collateral shall be applied first to the expenses (including all charges and disbursements of counsel) of retaking, holding, storing, processing and preparing for sale, selling, collecting, liquidating and the like, and then to the satisfaction of all Secured Obligations in accordance with the terms of of the Credit Agreement. Each Grantor shall be liable to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, and shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, on demand any deficiency which may remain after such sale, disposition, collection or liquidation of the Collateral.
Section 2.13
 
     Each Grantor hereby appoints the Administrative Agent as the Grantor's attorney-in-fact for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this Security Agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument which the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment is irrevocable and coupled with an interest; that the Administrative Agent shall have and may exercise rights under this power of attorney only upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall have the right and power;

     (d) to file any claims or take any action or institute any proceedings that the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or desirable for the collection of any of the Collateral or otherwise to enforce the rights of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, with respect to any of the Collateral; and
     (e) to execute, in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral provided for herein, any endorsement, assignments, or other instruments of conveyance or transfer with respect thereto.
     The granting of a security interest in the Collateral and the other provisions hereof shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Secured Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Secured Party or is repaid by any Secured Party in whole or in part in good faith settlement of a pending or threatened avoidance claim, whether upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Grantor or any other Loan Party or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

     . Each Grantor waives to the extent permitted by applicable law (a) any right to require any Secured Party or any other obligee of the Secured Obligations to (x) proceed against any Person or entity, including without limitation any Loan Party, (y) proceed against or exhaust any Collateral or other collateral for the Secured Obligations, or (z) pursue any other remedy in its power; (b) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any other Person, or by reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of any other Person or entity, (c) any right of subrogation, (d) any right to enforce any remedy which any Secured Party or any other obligee of the Secured Obligations now has or may hereafter have against any other Person and any benefit of and any right to participate in any collateral or security whatsoever now or hereafter held by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties. Each Grantor authorizes each Secured Party and each other obligee of the Secured Obligations without notice (except notice required by applicable law) or demand and without affecting its liability hereunder or under the Loan Documents from time to time to: (i) take and hold security, other than the Collateral herein described, for the payment of such Secured Obligations or any part thereof, and exchange, enforce, waive and release the Collateral herein described or any part thereof or any such other security; and (ii) apply such Collateral or other security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as such Secured Party or obligee in its discretion may determine.
14. 
Certain Waivers by the Grantors
     The Administrative Agent may at any time deliver (without representation, recourse or warranty) the Collateral or any part thereof to a Grantor and the receipt thereof by such Grantor shall be a complete and full acquittance for the Collateral so delivered, and the Administrative Agent shall thereafter be discharged from any liability or responsibility therefor.
     . Until the Facility Termination Date shall have occurred, the power of sale and other rights, powers and remedies granted to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties hereunder shall continue to exist and may be exercised by the Administrative Agent at any time and from time to time irrespective of the fact that any of the Secured Obligations or any part thereof may have become barred by any statute of limitations or that any part of the liability of any Grantor may have ceased.
