Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On October 28, 2009, BorgWarner Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits. The following exhibits are being furnished as part of this Report.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
     BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) reported third quarter U.S. GAAP earnings of $0.15 per diluted share today compared with $(1.12) per diluted share in the third quarter of 2008. The sequential gain in income from second quarter 2009 is attributable to continuous improvement in operational efficiency in combination with higher sales. Positive free cash flow of $13.6 million in the quarter (net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, including tooling outlays), further strengthened the balance sheet.
Auburn Hills, Michigan, October 28, 2009
     
Third Quarter Highlights:
"BorgWarner's continued focus on execution generated positive results during the quarter," said Timothy Manganello, Chairman and CEO. "Our earnings performance in the third quarter, which has lifted us to near breakeven levels year to date on a recurring basis, is a direct result of resizing our business for profitability at these sales levels. Our decremental margin in the quarter was approximately 15%, significantly better than our target range of 20% to 25%. As a result of actions taken over the last twelve months, BorgWarner is a much leaner company now with a renewed commitment to operational excellence and efficiency."
Comment and Outlook:
     Commenting on the remainder of the year, Manganello noted, "We continue to be cautiously optimistic about the fourth quarter. We expect production volumes to be incrementally higher than third quarter levels in North America, while visibility in Europe remains limited due to uncertainty surrounding consumer demand, the impact of expiring government-sponsored incentive programs and other market dynamics. Ultimately, we expect it to be another profitable quarter for our company. Furthermore, our leadership in fuel-efficient technologies, combined with the company's diversified customer base and broad geographic presence should enable BorgWarner to achieve sustained profitable growth over the long term."
 
BORGWARNER REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2009 RESULTS/2
     For the third quarter 2009, sales were $1,027.8 million, down 22.0% compared with $1,316.9 million in the third quarter 2008. Excluding the negative impact of currency, the decline would have been approximately 18%. Net income in the quarter was $17.2 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $(130.4) million, or $(1.12) per diluted share, in third quarter 2008. The third quarter 2008 loss included a restructuring charge of $(0.16) per diluted share, a charge of $(1.27) per diluted share for a goodwill adjustment related to the BERU acquisition, a valuation adjustment for foreign tax credits of $(0.12) per diluted share, and a charge related to the outcome of retiree healthcare benefits litigation of $(0.03) per diluted share. The impact of foreign currencies, primarily the lower Euro, lowered sales by approximately $50 million in third quarter 2009 compared with third quarter 2008, and reduced earnings by approximately $(3) million, or $(0.03) per diluted share.
Financial Results:
     For the first nine months of 2009, sales were $2,763.5 million, down 36.2% compared with $4,332.4 million in the first nine months of 2008. Excluding the negative impact of currency, the decline would have been approximately 31%. Net income in the first nine months of 2009 was a loss of $(25.7) million, or $(0.22) per diluted share, compared with income of $45.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2008. The loss in the first nine months of 2009 included a $(0.29) per diluted share loss related to restructuring activities, a $(0.03) per diluted share net loss from interest rate derivative agreements, a $(0.03) per diluted share loss upon adoption of Topic 805, Business Combinations (formerly referred to as FAS 141R), for the treatment of on-going acquisition-related activity, and a $0.15 per diluted share net gain related to retiree obligations resulting from the closure of the Muncie, Indiana, Drivetrain facility. The first nine months of 2008 net income included a third quarter restructuring charge of $(0.16) per diluted share, a charge of $(1.24) per diluted share for a goodwill adjustment related to the BERU acquisition, a valuation adjustment for foreign tax credits of $(0.11) per diluted share, a charge related to the outcome of retiree healthcare benefits litigation of $(0.03) per diluted share, and purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of BERU of $(0.04) per diluted share. The impact of foreign currencies, primarily the lower Euro, reduced sales by approximately $232 million in the first nine months of 2009 compared with first nine months of 2008, and reduced the loss in earnings by approximately $(3) million, or $(0.03) per diluted share.
 
BORGWARNER REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2009 RESULTS/3
     The following table reconciles the company's non-U.S. GAAP amounts included in the press release to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP amounts and is provided for comparisons with other results:
 
     The Company's operating income was $27.5 million in third quarter 2009 versus an operating loss of $(103.9) million in third quarter 2008. Excluding non-recurring items, operating income in third quarter 2008 was $71.9 million, or 5.5% of sales. Research and development spending was $41.4 million, or 4.0% of sales, versus $50.7 million, or 3.8% of sales, in third quarter 2008.
     Net cash provided by operating activities was $226.3 million in the first nine months of 2009 versus $265.1 million in the first nine months of 2008. Investments in capital expenditures, including tooling outlays, totaled $127.2 million during the first nine months of 2009, compared with $265.6 million for the same period in 2008. Balance sheet debt increased by $67.4 million at the end of the quarter compared with the end of 2008 primarily due to the net impact of the issuance of $373.8 million in convertible senior notes, the retirement of $136.7 million in senior notes and payments related to other short term debt obligations. Cash on hand increased by $155.4 million during the same period.
 
BORGWARNER REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2009 RESULTS/4
     Demand for the company's engine products in the third quarter was an improvement over the second quarter, but was still weak compared with the same period a year ago. Engine segment net sales decreased to $735.3 million, or 24.5%, compared with $974.1 million in the prior year's quarter. Excluding the negative impact of currency, sales were down approximately 21%. Earnings before interest and income taxes were $56.6 million.
Engine Group Results:
     Drivetrain segment third quarter sales were relatively strong considering the weakened state of the industry. Sales were $296.8 million, down only 14.5% compared with $347.2 million in third quarter 2008. Excluding the negative impact of currency, sales were down approximately 10%. Earnings before interest and income taxes were $7.5 million.
Drivetrain Group Results:
     During the quarter, the company announced it has been selected to supply turbochargers and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valves for various cars and light commercial vehicles manufactured by First Automotive Works (FAW), China's oldest and largest vehicle manufacturer, beginning in 2010. Located in Changchun, China, FAW sold 1.5 million vehicles in 70 countries last year. BorgWarner's proven turbocharging and EGR technologies will help FAW meet China 4 emissions standards, which are equivalent to Euro 4 emissions standards.
Recent Highlights:
     Also, BorgWarner has been selected to supply its friction materials and plates for the new ZF 8-speed automatic transmission (8HP), debuting on the 2010 BMW 760i. BorgWarner's friction technology helps reduce drag losses, allowing the transmission to achieve improved fuel economy and outstanding performance.
     The Company also announced the supply of collated friction packs and roller one-way clutch assemblies for the new generation of six-speed front-wheel drive automatic transmissions from the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group. Consisting of five variants, the new transmission family will ultimately drive 16 Hyundai and Kia vehicles powered by 2.0- to 3.8-liter gasoline and diesel engines. Debuting on the Hyundai Grandeur/Azera near-luxury sedans earlier this year, future applications for the new transmission family will include Hyundai's new Tucson, Sonata and Santa Fe, as well as Kia's new Sorento and Borrego (Mohave), among others.
     Additionally, BorgWarner was chosen to supply variable turbine geometry (VTG) turbochargers to boost John Deere Power Systems Interim Tier 4/Stage III B PowerTech PVX and PowerTech PSX 4.5L, 6.8L and 13.5L diesel engines for agricultural, construction, forestry and OEM applications. BorgWarner's turbocharging technology helps these new industrial engines meet stringent Interim Tier 4/Stage III B regulations for off-highway applications. These regulations require up to a 50% reduction in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions compared with previous standards.
 
BORGWARNER REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2009 RESULTS/5
     And, BorgWarner announced another eGearDrive transmission application on the all-electric CODA sedan, scheduled for introduction in California in 2010. Ideally suited for full performance electric vehicles on either front-wheel drive or rear-wheel drive transverse driveline applications, the BorgWarner 31-03 eGearDrive single-speed transmission delivers high torque capacity, high efficiency, and low noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) in a compact package.
