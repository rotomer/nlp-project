The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executives full attention and dedication to the Company currently and in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control which ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and which are competitive with those of other corporations.

Executives action or omission was in the best interests of the Company.  Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board, or if the Company is not the ultimate parent entity and is not publicly-traded, the board of directors (or, for a non-corporate entity, equivalent governing body) of the ultimate parent of the Company (the Applicable Board)or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.  The cessation of employment of the Executive shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Applicable Board (excluding the Executive if the Executive is a member of the Applicable Board) at a meeting of the Applicable Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel for the Executive, to be heard before the Applicable Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Applicable Board, the Executive is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

(ii)
 
any failure by the Company to comply with any of the provisions of Section 4(b) of this Agreement,  other than an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the Executive;
 
(iii)

any purported termination by the Company of the Executives employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by this Agreement; or
 
(v)
 
any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section 11(c) of this Agreement.

(d)
 
.  The Executives mental or physical incapacity following the occurrence of an event described above in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 5(c) shall not affect the Executives ability to terminate employment for Good Reason and the Executives death following delivery of a Notice of Termination for Good Reason shall not affect the entitlement of the estate of the Executive to severance payments or benefits provided hereunder upon a termination of employment for Good Reason.
Incapacity
 
(e)

The failure by the Executive or the Company to set forth in the Notice of Termination any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Good Reason or Cause shall not waive any right of the Executive or the Company, respectively, hereunder or preclude the Executive or the Company, respectively, from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing the Executives or the Companys rights hereunder.
Notice of Termination

.  Date of Termination means (i) if the Executives employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, or by the Executive for Good Reason, the date of receipt of the Notice of Termination or any later date specified therein, as the case may be, (ii) if the Executives employment is terminated by the Company other than  for Cause or Disability, the date on which the Company notifies the Executive of such termination, (iii) if the Executive resigns without Good Reason, the date on which the Executive notifies the Company of such termination and (iv) if the Executives employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability, the date of death of the Executive or the Disability Effective Date, as the case may be.

for [two] [three] years following the Date of Termination (the Benefits Period), the Company shall provide the Executive and his eligible dependents with medical and dental insurance coverage (the Health Care Benefits) and life insurance benefits no less favorable to those which the Executive and his spouse and eligible dependents were receiving immediately prior to the Date of Termination or, if more favorable to such persons, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company and the Affiliated Companies; , , that the Health Care Benefits shall be provided during the Benefits Period in such a manner that such benefits are excluded from the Executives income for federal income tax purposes; , , , that if the Executive becomes re-employed with another employer and is eligible to receive health care benefits under another employer-provided plan, the health care benefits provided hereunder shall be secondary to those provided under such other plan during such applicable period of eligibility.  The receipt of the Health Care Benefits shall be conditioned upon the Executive continuing to pay the Applicable COBRA Premium with respect to the level of coverage that the Executive has elected for the Executive and the Executives spouse and eligible dependents (, single, single plus one, or family).  During the portion of the Benefits Period in which the Executive and his eligible dependents continue to receive coverage under the Companys Health Care Benefits plans, the Company shall pay to the Executive a monthly amount equal to the Applicable COBRA Premium in respect of the maximum level of coverage that the Executive could have elected to receive for the Executive and the Executives spouse and eligible dependents if the Executive were still an employee of the Company during the Benefits Period (, single, single plus one, or family) regardless of what level of coverage is actually elected, which payment shall be paid in advance on the first payroll day of each month, commencing with the month immediately following the Executives Date of Termination.  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that, following the end of the Benefit Period, the Executive and the Executives spouse and eligible dependents shall be eligible to elect continued health coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code or other applicable law (COBRA Coverage), as if the Executives employment with the Company had terminated as of the end of such period.  For purposes of determining eligibility (but not the time of commencement of benefits) of the Executive for retiree welfare benefits pursuant to the Companys retiree welfare benefit plans, if any, the Executive shall be considered to have remained employed until the end of the Benefit Period and to have retired on the last day of such period. For purposes of this Provision, Applicable COBRA Premium means the monthly premium in effect from time to time for coverage provided to former employees under Section 4980B of the Code and the regulations thereunder with respect to a particular level of coverage (, single, single plus one, or family).

Certain Reduction of Payments by the Company
 
(a)
 
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event the independent accounting firm then used by the Company or such other nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as may be designated by the Executive (the Accounting Firm) shall determine that receipt of all payments or distributions by the Company or the affiliated companies in the nature of compensation to or for the Executives benefit, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise (a Payment), would subject the Executive to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Accounting Firm shall determine whether to reduce any of the Payments paid or payable pursuant to this Agreement (the Agreement Payments) to the Reduced Amount (as defined below).  The Agreement Payments shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount only if the Accounting Firm determines that the Executive would have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt (as defined below) of aggregate Payments if the Executives Agreement Payments were reduced to the Reduced Amount.  If the Accounting Firm determines that the Executive would not have a greater Net After-Tax Receipt of aggregate Payments if the Executives Agreement Payments were so reduced, the Executive shall receive all Agreement Payments to which the Executive is entitled under this Agreement.
 
(b)
 
If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Agreement Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Company shall promptly give the Executive notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof.  All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 9 shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive and shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than fifteen (15) days following the Date of Termination.  For purposes of reducing the Agreement Payments to the Reduced Amount, only amounts payable under this Agreement (and no other Payments) shall be reduced.  The reduction of the amounts payable hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by reducing the payments and benefits under the following sections in the following order:  (i) Section 6(a)(i)(B), (ii) Section 6(a)(i)(C), (iii) Section 6(a)(i)(A)(5) and (iv) Section 6(a)(ii).  All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company.
 
(c)
 
As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement which should not have been so paid or distributed (Overpayment) or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement could have been so paid or distributed (Underpayment), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder.  In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against either the Company or the Executive which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success determines that an Overpayment has been made, the Executive shall pay any such Overpayment to the Company together with Interest; , , that no amount shall be payable by the Executive to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not either reduce the amount on which the Executive is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes.  In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be paid promptly (and in no event later than 60 days following the date on which the Underpayment is determined) by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive together with Interest.

Net After-Tax Receipt shall mean the present value (as determined in accordance with Sections 280G(b)(2)(A)(ii) and 280G(d)(4) of the Code) of a Payment net of all taxes imposed on the Executive with respect thereto under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Code and under applicable state and local laws, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code and under state and local laws which applied to the Executives taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year, or such other rate(s) as the Accounting Firm determined to be likely to apply to the Executive in the relevant tax year(s).
 
(e)
 
[To the extent requested by the Executive, the Company shall cooperate with the Executive in good faith in valuing, and the Accounting Firm shall take into account the value of, services provided or to be provided by the Executive (including without limitation, the Executive agreeing to refrain from performing services pursuant to a covenant not to compete or similar covenant) before, on or after the date of a change in ownership or control of the Company (within the meaning of Q&A-2(b) of Section 280G of the Code), such that payments in respect of such services (or refraining from performing such services) may be considered reasonable compensation within the meaning of Q&A-9 and Q&A-40 to Q&A-44 of Section 280G of the Code and/or exempt from the definition of the term parachute payment within the meaning of Q&A-2(a) of Section 280G of the Code in accordance with Q&A-5(a) of Section 280G of the Code.]
