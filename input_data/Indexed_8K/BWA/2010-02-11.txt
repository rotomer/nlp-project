 BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE:  BWA) today reported fourth quarter U.S. GAAP earnings of $0.45 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $(0.70) per diluted share a year ago on strong sales growth of 28.6%. Positive free cash flow of $79.9 million in the quarter further strengthened the balance sheet.
Auburn Hills, Michigan, February 11, 2010
Fourth Quarter Highlights:
Full Year Highlights:
  Strong sales growth combined with our lean cost structure drove fourth quarter results, said Timothy Manganello, Chairman and CEO of BorgWarner.  We were able to control costs as volumes improved in our base business.  As a result, our operating margin improved substantially to 5.6% in fourth quarter 2009 from 0.5% in fourth quarter 2008, excluding non-recurring items. Furthermore, our earnings performance of $0.42 per diluted share, excluding non-recurring items, in fourth quarter 2009 was a significant improvement from the same period a year ago.
Fourth Quarter Performance:
We ended the year with a net debt to capital ratio of 17.9% compared with 24.9% at the end of 2008. This balance sheet strengthening is a remarkable accomplishment considering the difficult environment last year.
:  Today, the company provided sales and earnings guidance for 2010.  Sales are expected to grow 15% to 19% in 2010 compared with 2009, while full year earnings are expected to be within a range of $1.40 to $1.70 per diluted share.
2010 Outlook
We are optimistic about 2010, but also cautious as we contemplate the range of possible outcomes around the world, Manganello said. The recovery that we have seen in North America over the last two quarters is the foundation of our optimism. Based on a number of indicators, we expect production rates reached in the second half of 2009 in North America to extend into 2010. Furthermore, we believe that there may be potential upside to that scenario. We are also excited about our Asian businesses where higher production levels and new program launches in China, India, Korea and Japan are expected to drive growth for our company.
 
Our caution for 2010 is primarily related to Europe where visibility has improved from a year ago but is still limited due to uncertainty surrounding consumer demand, the impact of expiring government-sponsored incentive programs and other market dynamics.
  Sales were $1,198.3 million in fourth quarter 2009, up 28.6% from $931.5 million in fourth quarter 2008.  Net earnings in the quarter were $52.7 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $(81.4) million, or $(0.70) per diluted share in fourth quarter 2008. Fourth quarter 2009 included non-recurring items of $0.03 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2008 included net non-recurring items of $(0.70) per diluted share. These items are listed in a table below as reconciliations of non-U.S. GAAP measures, which are provided by the company for comparison with other results, and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.  The impact of foreign currencies in fourth quarter 2009, primarily the Euro, increased sales by $62.5 million, while the impact on net earnings was negligible.  
Financial Results:
Full-year 2009 sales were $3,961.8 million, down 24.7% from sales of $5,263.9 million in 2008.  Full-year 2009 net earnings were $27.0 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $(35.6) million, or $(0.31) per diluted share in 2008. Full-year 2009 net earnings included net non-recurring items of $(0.17) per diluted share while full-year 2008 included net non-recurring items of $(2.38) per diluted share. These items are listed in a table below as reconciliations of non-U.S. GAAP measures, which are provided by the company for comparison with other results, and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.  The impact of foreign currencies in full-year 2009, primarily the Euro, lowered sales by $(169.2) million and lowered net earnings by $(3.5) million or $(0.03) per diluted share.
The following table reconciles the company's non-U.S. GAAP measures included in the press release, which are provided for comparison with other results, and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures:

Balance sheet debt increased by $62.0 million at the end of 2009 compared with the end of 2008 primarily due to the net impact of the issuance of $373.8 million in convertible senior notes, the retirement of $136.7 million in senior notes and payments related to other short term debt obligations. Cash on hand increased by $254.0 million during the year. The ratio of balance sheet debt net of cash to capital was 17.9% at the end of 2009 compared with 24.9% at the end of 2008.
