Company Highlights:
First Quarter Highlights:
  Strong sales growth combined with cost controls drove first quarter results, said Timothy Manganello, Chairman and CEO of BorgWarner.  Growing demand for our technology around the world and improved volumes in our base business drove higher sales.  Most notably, our sales in Asia more than doubled from the same period a year ago. We successfully controlled costs while growing our sales during the quarter, resulting in a solid operating income margin of 8.3%. Our earnings performance of $0.65 per diluted share, excluding non-recurring items, in first quarter 2010 was a significant improvement from the same period a year ago.
First Quarter Performance:
  Today the Company raised its earnings guidance for 2010 to a range of $2.20 to $2.50 per diluted share.  Revenue growth in 2010 is now expected to be 28% to 32% compared with 2009. Production levels in first quarter 2010 were stronger than expected and demand appears to be based on fundamental improvements in the market, Manganello said.  The pace of recovery in North American production volumes continues to accelerate, we see a favorable shift in Europe toward vehicles with higher BorgWarner content, including diesels, and our sales growth in Asia continues to gain momentum.
2010 Revised Outlook:
