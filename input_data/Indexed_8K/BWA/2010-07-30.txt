  BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE:  BWA) today reported second quarter 2010 U.S. GAAP earnings of $0.68 per diluted share. Excluding non-recurring items in both periods, earnings were $0.78 per diluted share compared with a net loss of $(0.05) per diluted share a year ago.  Sales were up 55.2% from second quarter 2009 as growing demand for its fuel-efficient technologies drove the global powertrain systems suppliers strong results.
Auburn Hills, Michigan, July 30, 2010
Second Quarter Highlights:
 
 
  Growing demand for our leading-edge powertrain products drove our second quarter results, said Timothy Manganello, Chairman and CEO of BorgWarner.  Our sales were up 55% in second quarter 2010 compared with second quarter 2009, while global vehicle production was up 29%. The primary driver of our out-performance was new business growth as our product technology continued to penetrate the global market. Favorable macroeconomic trends, such as the continued volume shift in Europe toward vehicles with higher BorgWarner content, including diesels, also boosted results.
Second Quarter Performance:
 
In addition, a continued sharp focus on managing costs while sales grew resulted in an operating income margin of 9.7% in the quarter, excluding non-recurring items, which is the highest quarterly operating income margin that we have achieved since 2002.
  Today the Company raised its earnings guidance for 2010 to a range of $2.60 to $2.80 per diluted share from a previous range of $2.20 to $2.50 per diluted share. Both the current guidance range and the previous guidance range exclude non-recurring items.  Revenue growth in 2010 is now expected to be 32% to 35% compared with 2009. Our outlook for vehicle production in North America, Europe and China has improved since we last provided guidance, Manganello said. More importantly, we expect our growth to outpace the market as demand for our products continues to gain momentum. It is our expectation that 2010 will be a record earnings year for the Company.
2010 Improved Outlook:
