  BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE:  BWA) today reported third quarter 2010 U.S. GAAP earnings of $0.87 per diluted share compared with $0.15 per diluted share a year ago.  Sales were up 37.3% from third quarter 2009, sharply higher than global vehicle production growth of approximately 10%.
Auburn Hills, Michigan, October 27, 2010
Third Quarter Highlights:
  New business growth drove our third quarter results as our leading-edge powertrain technology continued to penetrate the global market, said Timothy Manganello, Chairman and CEO of BorgWarner.  Our sales were up 37% in third quarter 2010 compared with third quarter 2009, or 44% excluding the impact of currency, while global vehicle production was up 10%. We grew in every major region of the world, most notably in China where our sales were up nearly 70%. Our sales in China now represent approximately 6% of our consolidated sales and have nearly doubled from a year ago. Favorable macroeconomic trends, such as the continued volume shift in Europe toward vehicles with higher BorgWarner content, including diesels, also drove higher sales. A continued focus on execution at our operations resulted in a strong operating income margin of 8.7% in the third quarter, up from 2.7% a year ago.
Third Quarter Performance:
  Today, the Company raised its earnings guidance for 2010 to a range of $2.85 to $2.95 per diluted share from a previous range of $2.60 to $2.80 per diluted share. Both the current guidance range and the previous guidance range exclude non-recurring items.  Revenue growth in 2010 is now expected to be approximately 40% compared with 2009. Our outlook for vehicle production in North America, Europe and China has improved since our July 2010 guidance, Manganello said. More importantly, we expect our growth to outpace the market as demand for our products continues to gain momentum. It is our expectation that 2010 will be a record year for the Company for both sales and earnings.
2010 Improved Outlook:

BORGWARNER POSTS STRONG THIRD QUARTER/3
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $312.7 million in the first nine months of 2010 compared with $226.3 million in the first nine months of 2009.  Investments in capital expenditures, including tooling outlays, totaled $187.8 million in the first nine months of 2010, compared with $127.2 million in the first nine months of 2009.  Balance sheet debt increased by $349.0 million and cash on hand increased by $74.8 million compared with the end of 2009 primarily due to the acquisition of Dytech ENSA SL, the repurchase of approximately 5.0 million shares of common stock, the issuance of $250 million of 10-year senior notes, and the adoption of amended ASC Topic 860, , which requires the Company to re flect its $80 million receivables securitization facility in its financial statements. The ratio of balance sheet debt net of cash to capital remained strong at 24.8% at the end of third quarter 2010.
