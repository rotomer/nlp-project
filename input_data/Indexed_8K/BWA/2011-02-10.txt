  BorgWarner Inc.

Sales were up 28.0% from fourth quarter 2009, sharply higher than global vehicle production growth of approximately 4%.
Auburn Hills, Michigan, February 10, 2011
Fourth Quarter Highlights:
Full Year Highlights:
  The fourth quarter was a strong finish to an exceptional year for our company, said Timothy Manganello, Chairman and CEO of BorgWarner.  Our sales were up 28% in fourth quarter 2010 compared with fourth quarter 2009, or 33% excluding the impact of currency, while global vehicle production was up 5%. New business growth was the driving force behind our fourth quarter results as it had been throughout the year. Adoption rates of our leading-edge powertrain technology continued to outpace vehicle production growth in every major region of the world. A continued focus on execution at our operations resulted in a strong operating income margin of 10.3% in the fourth quarter, up sharply from 5.6% a year ago.
Comment and Outlook:
 
For the full year, we posted record sales and earnings, and our operating income margin was the highest it has been in several years. These are remarkable accomplishments considering they were achieved with depressed volumes and immediately following one of the most difficult periods in our history. However, we do not believe that 2010 was a peak year. In 2011, we expect 16% to 20% sales growth and 30% to 40% earnings growth compared with 2010, and an operating income margin of 10.5% or better," said Manganello.

Full year 2010 sales were $5,652.8 million, up 42.7% from $3,961.8 million in 2009.

BORGWARNER POSTS RECORD EARNINGS AND RECORD SALES IN FOURTH QUARTER 2010/3
Net cash provided by operating activities was $538.9 million in 2010 compared with $351.0 million in 2009.  Investments in capital expenditures, including tooling outlays, totaled $276.6 million in 2010, compared with $172.0 million in 2009.  Balance sheet debt increased by $338.1 million and cash on hand increased by $92.5 million compared with the end of 2009 primarily due to the acquisition of Dytech ENSA SL, the repurchase of approximately 7.1 million shares of common stock, the issuance of $250 million of 10-year senior notes, and the adoption of amended ASC Topic 860, , which requires the Company to reflect its $80 million receivables securitization facility in its financial statements. The ratio of balance sheet debt net of cash to capital remained strong at 24.0% at the end of 2010.
Accounting for Transfer of Financial Assets
:  Engine segment net sales were $1,118.4 million in fourth quarter 2010, up 31.1% from $853.0 million in the prior years quarter as a result of strong timing system and turbocharger growth in Asia and higher turbocharger and fan and fan drive sales in Europe. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were up approximately 37%.  Adjusted earnings before interest and income taxes were $162.0 million for the Engine Group in fourth quarter 2010, up 94.5% from $83.3 million in fourth quarter 2009.
