Sales were up 34.5% from first quarter 2010, significantly higher than global vehicle production growth of approximately 5%.
Auburn Hills, Michigan, April 28, 2011
First Quarter Results Highlights:
Company Highlights:
  We began 2011 with a strong first quarter, said Timothy Manganello, Chairman and CEO of BorgWarner. Growing demand for our advanced powertrain technology enabled us to grow significantly faster than the market. Excluding the impact of currency and sales related to the Haldex and ENSA acquisitions, our sales were up approximately 26% in the first quarter, compared with a global market that grew only 5%. We successfully managed costs while growing our sales during the quarter resulting in a solid operating income margin of 10.4%. Earnings of $1.00 per diluted share in first quarter 2011 were a significant improvement from the same period a year ago.
First Quarter Performance:
  Today the company reiterated its 2011 earnings guidance range of $3.85 to $4.15 per diluted share. Revenue growth in 2011 is now expected to be 19% to 23% compared with 2010, up from the previous guidance range of 16% to 20%, primarily due to the Haldex Traction Systems acquisition that closed in January. The acquisition is expected to have minimal impact on 2011 earnings as purchase accounting adjustments will likely offset most of the operating income generated by the business.
2011 Outlook:
 
Clearly there is great deal of concern regarding the disasters in Japan and their impact on the global automotive market, Manganello said.  While uncertainty remains, we expect that the impact on our business will be limited. Vehicle demand remains strong in our largest markets and should offset the volume declines in Japan.
 
 
 
 
BORGWARNER POST STRONG FRIST QUARTER/2
 
  Sales were $1,730.4 million in first quarter 2011, up 34.5% from $1,286.8 million in first quarter 2010.  Net earnings in the quarter were $124.5 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared with $76.2 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in first quarter 2010. First quarter 2010 net earnings included a non-recurring item of $(0.02) per diluted share. This item is listed in a table below as a reconciliation of a non-U.S. GAAP measure, which is provided by the company for comparison with other results, and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.  The impact of foreign currencies in first quarter 2011, primarily the Japanese Yen and the Chinese Renminbi, increased sales by $6.1 million, while the impact on net earnings was $0.02 per diluted share.
Financial Results:
The following table reconciles the company's non-U.S. GAAP measures included in the press release, which are provided for comparison with other results, and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures:
Net cash used in operating activities was $41.4 million in first quarter 2011 compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $64.1 million in first quarter 2010.  Investments in capital expenditures, including tooling outlays, totaled $70.2 million in first quarter 2011, compared with $55.3 million in first quarter 2010.  Balance sheet debt increased by $255.3 million and cash on hand decreased by $227.0 million compared with the end of 2010, primarily due to the Haldex acquisition and share repurchases. The ratio of balance sheet debt net of cash to capital was 34.0% at the end of first quarter 2011 compared with 24.0% at the end of 2010.
:  Engine segment net sales were $1,249.4 million in first quarter 2011, up 37.9% from $906.0 million in the prior years quarter as a result of strong global sales growth in nearly all major product groups and the Dytech ENSA acquisition. The impact of currency in the quarter was negligible.  Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes and non-controlling interest were $186.1 million, up 74.4% from $106.7 million in first quarter 2010.
Engine Group Results
  Drivetrain segment net sales were $486.4 million in first quarter 2011, up 26.1% from $385.8 million in the prior years quarter as a result of strong four-wheel drive system sales in Asia, higher dual clutch transmission module sales in Europe, higher traditional automatic transmission component sales around the world and the Haldex Traction Systems acquisition. The impact of currency in the quarter was negligible. Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes and non-controlling interest were $32.0 million, down 12.8% from $36.7 million in first quarter 2010, primarily due to transaction costs related to the Haldex acquisition, increased research and development expenses, and operational inefficiencies in its European operations.
