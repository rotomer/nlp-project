This is additional proof that BorgWarner is a global technology leader in powertrain solutions including turbochargers, said Timothy M. Manganello, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, BorgWarner. We are proud of our long history of leading turbocharger innovation and our continued investment in research and development.  BorgWarner is pleased with its return on this investment  both through the development and sale of innovative products and through the receipt of fees related to patent infringement lawsuits.
The lawsuit involved three BorgWarner patents relating to the design and manufacture of cast titanium compressor wheels, used in turbochargers.  Cast titanium compressor wheels are preferred for commercial vehicle engine applications with high cyclical loads and higher charging pressures.  BorgWarners patents were the result of a special development program to find a cost-effective solution for these applications.
