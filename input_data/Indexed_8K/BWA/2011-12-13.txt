Auburn Hills, Michigan, December 13, 2011
- BorgWarner has elected to settle all conversions of its 3.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2012 (the Notes) by delivering solely shares of the company's common stock to converting Noteholders.
On and after December 15, 2011, the company will deliver to each converting Noteholder a number of shares of the company's common stock equal to the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be converted, divided by $1,000, and multiplied by the then-applicable conversion rate.
