Comment and Outlook:
The fourth quarter was a strong finish to an exceptional year for our company, said Timothy Manganello, Chairman and CEO of BorgWarner. Our sales were up
16%
in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with fourth quarter 2010. Excluding the impact of currency and sales related to the acquisition of the Traction Systems division of Haldex, which closed in first quarter 2011, our sales were up 12%. Global vehicle production was up 1% during the same period. New business growth drove our fourth quarter results as it did throughout the year. Adoption rates of our leading-edge powertrain technology continued to outpace vehicle production in every major region of the world. The continued focus on execution at our operations resulted in a very strong operating income margin of 12.0% in the fourth quarter, excluding non-recurring items. This is sharply higher than the 10.3% operating income margin posted in the fourth quarter of 2010.
For the full year, our sales, earnings and operating income margin set all-time records. In 2012, we expect 10% to 12% sales growth compared with 2011, earnings of $5.35 to $5.65 per diluted share and an operating income margin of 11.5% or better. This should continue our record financial pace, said Manganello.
