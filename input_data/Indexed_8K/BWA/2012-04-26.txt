PER DILUTED SHARE, UP 28% FROM FIRST QUARTER 2011
Auburn Hills, Michigan, April 26, 2012
 BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) today reported first quarter 2012 earnings of
$1.28
per diluted share, a new first quarter record for the company. Net sales were up
11%
from first quarter 2011, while global vehicle production was up approximately 4%.
First Quarter Highlights:
First Quarter Performance:
The first quarter was a strong start to the year, said Timothy Manganello, Chairman and CEO of BorgWarner. The focus on fuel economy and improved emissions around the globe continued to drive demand for BorgWarner technology, and above-market growth for our company. Excluding the impact of currency and 2011 acquisitions and divestitures, our net sales were up approximately 13% in the first quarter compared with first quarter 2011, while global vehicle production grew only 4%. While growing our net sales in the quarter, we also successfully managed costs, which resulted in a strong quarterly operating income margin of 11.8%.
2012 Outlook:
After considering its financial performance in the first quarter, the company reiterated its guidance for 2012 of 10% to 12% annual sales growth and earnings of $5.35 to $5.65 per diluted share. The outlook for our business for the remainder of 2012 is generally stable although we are watching Europe closely," Manganello said.
Financial Results:
Net sales were
$1,913 million
in first quarter 2012, up
11%
from
$1,730 million
in first quarter 2011. Net earnings in the quarter were
$158 million
, or
$1.28
per diluted share, compared with
$125 million
, or
$1.00
per diluted share, in first quarter 2011. The impact of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, decreased net sales by approximately $45 million, and decreased net earnings approximately $0.03 per diluted share, in first quarter 2012 compared with first quarter 2011.
Net cash provided by operating activities was
$31 million
in first quarter 2012 compared with net cash used in operating activities of
$(41) million
in first quarter 2011. Capital expenditures, including tooling outlays, totaled
$95 million
in first quarter 2012, compared with
$70 million
in first quarter 2011. Balance sheet debt increased by
$81 million
and cash on hand increased by
$37 million
compared with the end of 2011. The $44 million increase in balance sheet debt (net of cash) was primarily due to seasonal working capital funding requirements. The ratio of balance sheet debt (net of cash) to capital was
27.1%
at the end of first quarter 2012 compared with
28.3%
at the end of 2011.
