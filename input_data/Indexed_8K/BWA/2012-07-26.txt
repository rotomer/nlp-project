Second Quarter Highlights:
Revised Full Year Guidance:
Second Quarter Performance:
We executed very well in the second quarter, said Timothy Manganello, Chairman and CEO of BorgWarner. Despite declines in light vehicle and commercial vehicle production in Europe, our largest market, the focus on fuel economy and improved emissions around the globe continued to drive growth for BorgWarner. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currencies and 2011 dispositions, our net sales were up approximately 10% in the second quarter compared with second quarter 2011. Our growth was in line with global light vehicle production growth of 10%, although much of the industry's growth was in Japan, a market that comprises less than 5% of our sales. While growing our net sales in the quarter, we did an excellent job managing costs, which resulted in an all-time record operating income margin of 12.5%, excluding non-comparable items.

2012 Outlook:
Based on weakening global economic conditions, the company adjusted its net sales and net earnings guidance for 2012. Annual net sales growth is now expected to be 4% to 6%, down from 10% to 12% previously. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currencies, annual net sales growth is now expected to be 9% to 11%, down from 14% to 16% previously. Net earnings are now expected to be within a range of $5.05 to $5.25 per diluted share, excluding non-comparable items, down from $5.35 to $5.65 per diluted share previously. Our outlook for Europe and for commercial vehicle markets around the world has been negatively impacted by the general slowdown in the global economy. Despite this, we expect to deliver industry-leading sales growth and record earnings this year," Manganello said.

40%
