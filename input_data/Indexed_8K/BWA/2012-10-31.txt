REVISES 2012 FULL YEAR SALES AND EARNINGS GUIDANCE DUE TO WEAKENING MARKET CONDITIONS IN EUROPE

Third Quarter Highlights:
Revised Full Year Guidance:
Third Quarter Performance:
Our operations were very efficient in the quarter, said Timothy Manganello, Chairman and CEO of BorgWarner. Despite declines in light vehicle production in Europe, our largest market, the focus on fuel economy and improved emissions around the globe continued to drive growth for BorgWarner. Excluding the impact of foreign currencies and 2011 dispositions, our net sales were up approximately 2% in the third quarter compared with third quarter 2011, in line with global light vehicle production growth of 2%. Light vehicle production in Europe, a geographic market that comprises over half of our sales, was down 6%. In a challenging sales environment, we did an excellent job managing costs, which resulted in a solid operating income margin of 11.3%, excluding non-comparable items.
2012 Outlook:
Based on weakening global economic conditions, particularly in Europe, the company adjusted its net sales and net earnings guidance for 2012. Annual net sales growth is now expected to be 0% to 1%, compared with 4% to 6% previously. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currencies, annual

net sales growth is now expected to be 5% to 6%, compared with 9% to 11% previously. Net earnings are now expected to be within a range of $4.90 to $5.00 per diluted share, excluding non-comparable items, down from $5.05 to $5.25 per diluted share previously. Our outlook for Europe, our largest market, has deteriorated due to the general economic slowdown across the continent and its impact on the automotive industry. Despite this, we expect to deliver record earnings this year," Manganello said.

$1,695 million
in third quarter 2012, down

at the end of third quarter 2012 compared with

at the end of 2011.

in third quarter 2012, flat with

in third quarter 2011.
