(l)
    
as to which the Administrative Agent has not notified Seller that the Administrative Agent has determined, acting reasonably, that such Receivable or class of Receivables is not acceptable as an Eligible Receivable, including, without limitation, because such Receivable arises under a Contract that is not acceptable to the Administrative Agent, acting reasonably,
(m)

, that if such dispute, offset, counterclaim or defense affects only a portion of the Outstanding Balance of such Receivable, then such Receivable may be deemed an Eligible Receivable to the extent of the portion of such Outstanding Balance which is not so affected, and
provided
,
further
, that Receivables of any Obligor which has any accounts payable by the applicable Originator (thus giving rise to a potential offset against such Receivables) may be treated as Eligible Receivables to the extent that the Obligor of such Receivables has agreed pursuant to a written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that such Receivables shall not be subject to such offset,
(n)
    
as to which the applicable Originator has satisfied and fully performed all obligations on its part with respect to such Receivable required to be fulfilled by it, and no further action is required to be performed by any Person with respect thereto other than payment thereon by the applicable Obligor,
(o)
    
as to which all right, title and interest to and in which has been validly transferred by the applicable Originator directly or indirectly to Seller pursuant to one or both of the Purchase Agreement, and Seller has good and marketable title thereto free and clear of any adverse claim, and
(p)
