Report of Independent Accountants The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Properties, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying combined statement of revenue over certain operating expenses (the "Statement") of 399 Park Avenue (the "Property") for the year ended December 31, 2001. This Statement is the responsibility of the Property's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this Statement based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Statement. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Statement. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. The accompanying Statement was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (for inclusion in the current report on Form 8-K/A of Boston Properties, Inc. dated September 25, 2002) as described in Note 2 and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the Property's revenue and expenses. In our opinion, the Statement referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the revenue over certain operating expenses (as described in Note 2), of the Property for the year ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP November 22, 2002
399 PARK AVENUE COMBINED STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES (in thousands) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements. 2
399 PARK AVENUE NOTES TO THE COMBINED STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY The accompanying combined statements of revenue over certain operating expenses (the "Statement") includes the operations of an approximately 1.7 million square foot Class A office tower known as 399 Park Avenue (the "Property"), which was operated as two separate condominium units, located in New York City, New York. On September 25, 2002, the Property was acquired by Boston Properties, Inc. (the "Company") through its subsidiary Boston Properties Limited Partnership from Citibank, N.A. ("Citibank"). Citibank occupies approximately 696,000 square feet of space at the Property at September 30, 2002. Total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $1.06 billion, which was financed with a $1.0 billion unsecured bridge loan, and the balance with cash. 2. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The accompanying Statement has been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting but is not representative of the actual operations of the Property for the periods shown. The Statement has been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, this Statement excludes revenue attributable to the Citibank owner-occupied space in condominium unit two and certain historical expenses not comparable to the operations of the Property after acquisition such as certain ancillary income, amortization, depreciation, interest, certain owner occupant expenses, corporate expenses and certain other costs not directly related to the future operations of the Property. 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES RENTAL REVENUE Rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. The excess of recognized rentals over amounts due pursuant to lease terms is recorded as accrued rent. The impact of the straight-line rent adjustment increased revenue by approximately $64,000 and $4,585,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 and for the period from January 1, 2002 through September 24, 2002 (unaudited), respectively. UNAUDITED INTERIM INFORMATION The Statement for the period from January 1, 2002 through September 24, 2002 is unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such Statement (in accordance with the Basis of Accounting as described in Note 2) have been included. The results of operations for the period are not necessarily indicative of the Property's future results of operations. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 4. DESCRIPTION OF LEASING ARRANGEMENTS The office and retail space is leased to tenants under leases with terms that vary in length. Certain leases contain reimbursement clauses and renewal options. Minimum lease payments due under noncancelable operating leases in effect as of September 25, 2002 (unaudited), for the remainder of 2002 and annually thereafter are as follows: (1) Includes the addition of minimum lease payments that Citibank will owe under terms of the lease agreement signed concurrent with the Company's acquisition of the Property. As of September 25, 2002, two tenants occupied approximately 68% of the leasable square feet of the Property. 3

BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC. NOTES TO THE PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS The Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations reflect the historical results of operations of One and Two Independence Square and the historical results of operations as reflected in the Combined Statements of Revenue Over Certain Operating Expenses (the "Statement") of 399 Park Avenue, as adjusted for base rent, interest expense and depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2001 and the period from January 1, 2002 through September 24, 2002 (unaudited). (A) Base Rent includes adjustments based on the pro forma acquisition date of January 1, 2001 as follows: (1) Concurrent with the acquisition of 399 Park Avenue, the Company entered into a leasing arrangement with Citibank. The amounts above include an adjustment to base rent to reflect rental income attributed to Citibank's occupied space in the pro forma periods. The straight-line rent adjustment is based on the contractual lease terms entered into by Citibank and the Company at the acquisition date of 399 Park Avenue for Citibank occupied space and is also based on the terms related to space occupied by Citibank through November 2001 and subsequently leased to another tenant. The amount above also includes an adjustment to straight-line rent for pro forma purposes. (B) Reflects the net increase in interest expense as a result of the unsecured bridge financing obtained in connection with the acquisition of 399 Park Avenue and the repayment of the mortgage financing and a partial repayment of the unsecured bridge financing in conjunction with the disposition of One and Two Independence Square. The unsecured bridge financing totaling $1.0 billion requires payments of interest only at a current variable rate of Eurodollar + 1.45% and matures in September 2003. The debt financing repaid in connection with the disposition of Independence Square One and Two consists of the following: a $75.0 million loan secured by One Independence Square which bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR + 1.60% (3.42% at September 30, 2002), a $114.1 million loan secured by Two Independence Square which bears interest at an increasing fixed rate with a current fixed rate of 8.5% and an effective interest rate of 8.09% and an approximately $144.9 million pay down of the unsecured bridge loan with the net proceeds from the disposition of One and Two Independence Square. The interest rate of 3.27% and 3.33% used in the Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations is equal to the one-month LIBOR rate at September 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively, plus 145 basis points. The effect on the Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations for a 1/8% change in rates is approximately $2.6 million and $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and the year ended December 31, 2001, respectively. (C) Reflects the pro forma depreciation and amortization expense for 399 Park Avenue offset by the depreciation and amortization expense related to the disposition of One and Two Independence Square. Depreciation for 399 Park Avenue is based on a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to land, 10
building and other assets and is subject to change as additional information is obtained. Depreciation expense is computed over an estimated useful life of 40 years for the building. (D) Reflects an adjustment for the minority interest in the Operating Partnership's share of pro forma income before discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. 11
