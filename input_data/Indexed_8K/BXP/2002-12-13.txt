Date: December 13, 2002 BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC. By: /s/ Douglas T. Linde --------------------- Douglas T. Linde Chief Financial Officer
Report of Independent Accountants To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Properties, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying combined statement of revenue over certain operating expenses (the "Statement") of 399 Park Avenue (the "Property") for the year ended December 31, 2001. This Statement is the responsibility of the Property's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this Statement based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Statement. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Statement. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. The accompanying Statement was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (for inclusion in the current report on Form 8-K/A of Boston Properties, Inc. dated September 25, 2002) as described in Note 2 and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the Property's revenue and expenses. In our opinion, the Statement referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the revenue over certain operating expenses (as described in Note 2), of the Property for the year ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP November 22, 2002
399 PARK AVENUE COMBINED STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES (in thousands) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements. 2
399 PARK AVENUE NOTES TO THE COMBINED STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY The accompanying combined statements of revenue over certain operating expenses (the "Statement") includes the operations of an approximately 1.7 million square foot Class A office tower known as 399 Park Avenue (the "Property"), which was operated as two separate condominium units, located in New York City, New York. On September 25, 2002, the Property was acquired by Boston Properties, Inc. (the "Company") through its subsidiary Boston Properties Limited Partnership from Citibank, N.A. ("Citibank"). Citibank occupies approximately 696,000 square feet of space at the Property at September 30, 2002. Total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $1.06 billion, which was financed with a $1.0 billion unsecured bridge loan, and the balance with cash. 2. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The accompanying Statement has been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting but is not representative of the actual operations of the Property for the periods shown. The Statement has been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, this Statement excludes revenue attributable to the Citibank owner-occupied space in condominium unit two and certain historical expenses not comparable to the operations of the Property after acquisition such as certain ancillary income, amortization, depreciation, interest, certain owner occupant expenses, corporate expenses and certain other costs not directly related to the future operations of the Property. 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES RENTAL REVENUE Rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. The excess of recognized rentals over amounts due pursuant to lease terms is recorded as accrued rent. The impact of the straight-line rent adjustment increased revenue by approximately $64,000 and $4,585,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 and for the period from January 1, 2002 through September 24, 2002 (unaudited), respectively. UNAUDITED INTERIM INFORMATION The Statement for the period from January 1, 2002 through September 24, 2002 is unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such Statement (in accordance with the Basis of Accounting as described in Note 2) have been included. The results of operations for the period are not necessarily indicative of the Property's future results of operations. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 4. DESCRIPTION OF LEASING ARRANGEMENTS The office and retail space is leased to tenants under leases with terms that vary in length. Certain leases contain reimbursement clauses and renewal options. Minimum lease payments due under noncancelable operating leases in effect as of September 25, 2002 (unaudited), for the remainder of 2002 and annually thereafter are as follows:
399 PARK AVENUE NOTES TO THE COMBINED STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES (1) Includes the addition of minimum lease payments that Citibank will owe under terms of the lease agreement signed concurrent with the Company's acquisition of the Property. As of September 25, 2002, two tenants occupied approximately 68% of the leasable square feet of the Property.
BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC. PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INTRODUCTION TO THE PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET September 30, 2002 (Unaudited) The accompanying unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet of Boston Properties, Inc. (the "Company") is presented as if the offering of unsecured senior notes by its operating partnership, Boston Properties Limited Partnership, and the application of the estimated net proceeds thereof (the "Offering") and the disposition of One and Two Independence Square, which occurred subsequent to September 30, 2002, had been consummated on September 30, 2002. Such pro forma information is based on the historical Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Company as of that date, giving effect to the transactions described above. This Pro Forma Consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 (unaudited). In management's opinion, all adjustments necessary to reflect the above transactions have been made. The following Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet is not necessarily indicative of what the actual financial position would have been assuming the above transactions had been consummated on September 30, 2002 nor does it purport to represent the future financial position of the Company.

The unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated financial information prepared by Boston Properties' management is not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations would have been for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 or for the year ended December 31, 2001, had the previously described transactions actually occurred on January 1, 2001 and the effect thereof carried forward through the nine month period ended September 30, 2002, nor do they purport to present the future results of operations of the Company.

BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC. PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 (UNAUDITED) (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT FOR PER SHARE AMOUNTS) The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC. NOTES TO THE PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited) The Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations reflect the Offering, the historical results of operations of One and Two Independence Square and the historical results of operations as reflected in the Combined Statements of Revenue Over Certain Operating Expenses (the "Statement") of 399 Park Avenue, as adjusted for base rent, interest expense and depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2001 and the period from January 1, 2002 through September 24, 2002 (unaudited). (A) Base Rent includes adjustments based on the pro forma acquisition date of January 1, 2001 as follows (dollars in thousands): (1) Concurrent with the acquisition of 399 Park Avenue, the Company entered into a leasing arrangement with Citibank. The amounts above include an adjustment to base rent to reflect rental income attributed to Citibank's occupied space in the pro forma periods. The straight-line rent adjustment is based on the contractual lease terms entered into by Citibank and the Company at the acquisition date of 399 Park Avenue for Citibank occupied space and is also based on the terms related to space occupied by Citibank through November 2001 and subsequently leased to another tenant. The amount above also includes an adjustment to straight-line rent for pro forma purposes. (B) Reflects the net increase in interest expense as a result of the unsecured bridge financing obtained in connection with the acquisition of 399 Park Avenue and the repayment of the mortgage financing and a partial repayment of the unsecured bridge financing in conjunction with the disposition of One and Two Independence Square. The unsecured bridge financing totaling $1.0 billion requires payments of interest only at a current variable rate of Eurodollar + 1.45% and matures in September 2003. The debt financing repaid in connection with the disposition of Independence Square One and Two consists of the following: a $75.0 million loan secured by One Independence Square which bears interest at a variable rate of LIBOR + 1.60% (3.42% at September 30, 2002), a $114.1 million loan secured by Two Independence Square which bears interest at an increasing fixed rate with a current fixed rate of 8.50% and an effective interest rate of 8.09% and an approximately $144.9 million pay down of the unsecured bridge loan with the net proceeds from the disposition of One and Two Independence Square. The interest rate of 3.27% and 3.33% used in the Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations is equal to the one-month LIBOR rate at September 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively, plus 145 basis points. The effect on the Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations for a 1/8% change in rates is approximately $2.6 million and $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and the year ended December 31, 2001, respectively. (C) Reflects the pro forma depreciation and amortization expense for 399 Park Avenue offset by the depreciation and amortization expense related to the disposition of One and Two Independence Square. Depreciation for 399 Park Avenue is based on a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to land, building and other assets and is subject to change as additional information is obtained. Depreciation expense is computed over an estimated useful life of 40 years for the building.
BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC. NOTES TO THE PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited) (D) Reflects an adjustment for the minority interest in the Operating Partnership's share of pro forma income before discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. (E) Reflects the incremental interest expense on the $750 million unsecured senior notes due 2013 assuming a $740.9 million pay down of the unsecured bridge loan with the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes. The incremental interest expense is the result of the interest rate on the unsecured senior notes of 6.25% as compared to the interest rate on the unsecured bridge loan which bears interest at Eurodollar + 1.45% (3.27% and 3.33% at September 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively). The adjustment, as detailed below, also includes amortization of the discount on the unsecured senior notes and deferred financing costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and the year ended December 31, 2001, as follows:

alternatively, be embodied in and evidenced by the record of Holders of Securities of such series voting in favor thereof, either in person or by proxies duly appointed in writing, at any meeting of Holders of Securities of such series duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of Article Fifteen, or a combination of such instruments and any such record.

Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other reasonable manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.

The Trustee and the Company may assume that such ownership of any Bearer Security continues until (1) another certificate or affidavit bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Bearer Security is produced, or (2) such Bearer Security is produced to the Trustee by some other Person, or (3) such Bearer Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security, or (4) such Bearer Security is no longer Outstanding. The ownership of Bearer Securities may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient. (e) If the Company shall solicit from the Holders of Registered Securities any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, the Company may, at its option, in or pursuant to a Board Resolution, fix in advance a record date for the determination of Holders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, 12
consent, waiver or other Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. Notwithstanding TIA Section 316(c), such record date shall be the record date specified in or pursuant to such Board Resolution, which shall be a date not earlier than the date 30 days prior to the first solicitation of Holders generally in connection therewith and not later than the date such solicitation is completed. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act may be given before or after such record date, but only the Holders of record at the close of business on such record date shall be deemed to be Holders for the purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding Securities have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities shall be computed as of such record date; PROVIDED THAT no such authorization, agreement or consent by the Holders on such record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than eleven months after the record date. (f) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee, any Security Registrar, any Paying Agent, any Authenticating Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.

appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, if any, and not earlier than the earliest date, if any, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders of Registered Securities is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Registered Securities or the sufficiency of any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities given as provided herein. Any notice mailed to a Holder in the manner herein prescribed shall be conclusively deemed to have been received by such Holder, whether or not such Holder actually receives such notice. If by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification to Holders of Registered Securities as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification to such Holders for every purpose hereunder. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or otherwise specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 3.01, where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Bearer Securities of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given if published in an Authorized Newspaper in The City of New York and in such other city or cities as may be specified in such Securities on a Business Day, such publication to be not later than the latest date, if any, and not earlier than the earliest date, if any, prescribed for the giving of such notice. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than once, on the date of the first such publication. If by reason of the suspension of publication of any Authorized Newspaper or Authorized Newspapers or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to publish any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, then such notification to Holders of Bearer Securities as shall be given with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute sufficient notice to such Holders for every purpose hereunder. Neither the failure to give notice by publication to any particular Holder of Bearer Securities as provided above, nor any defect in any notice so published, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Bearer Securities or the sufficiency of any notice to Holders of Registered Securities given as provided herein. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver required or permitted under this Indenture shall be in the English language, except that any published notice may be in an official language of the country of publication. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. SECTION 1.07. COUNTERPARTS; EFFECT OF HEADINGS AND TABLE OF CONTENTS. This Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same Indenture. 14

If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision hereof which is required or deemed to be included in this Indenture by any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, such required provision shall control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be. ARTICLE TWO - SECURITIES FORMS SECTION 2.01. FORMS OF SECURITIES.

[ ], -------------------------------- as Trustee Dated: By: ------------------------------- ------------------------------- Authorized Signatory ------------------------------- SECTION 2.03. SECURITIES ISSUABLE IN GLOBAL FORM. If Securities of or within a series are issuable in the form of one or more Global Securities, then, notwithstanding clause (8) of Section 3.01 and the provisions of Section 3.02, any such Global Security or Securities may provide that it or they shall represent the aggregate amount of all Outstanding Securities of such series (or such lesser amount as is permitted by the terms thereof) from time to time endorsed thereon and may also provide that the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities of such series represented thereby may from time to time be increased or decreased to reflect exchanges. Any endorsement of any Global Security to reflect the amount, or any increase or decrease in the amount, or changes in the rights of Holders thereof, of Outstanding Securities represented thereby shall be made (or caused to be made) by the Trustee in such manner or by such Person or Persons as shall be specified therein or in the Company Order to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 3.03 or 3.04. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.03 and, if applicable, Section 3.04, the Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any Global Security in permanent global form in the manner and upon instructions given by the Person or Persons specified therein or in the applicable Company Order. If a Company Order pursuant to Section 3.03 or 3.04 has been, or simultaneously is, delivered, any instructions by the Company with respect to endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a Global Security shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 1.02 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel. The provisions of the last sentence of Section 3.03 shall apply to any Security represented by a Global Security if such Security was never issued and sold by the Company and the Company delivers to the Trustee the Global Security together with written instructions (which need not comply with Section 1.02 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) with regard to the reduction in the principal amount of Securities represented thereby, together with the written statement contemplated by the last sentence of Section 3.03. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.07, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, payment of principal of and any premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest, if any, on any Global Security in permanent global form shall be made to the registered Holder thereof. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.08 and except as provided in the preceding paragraph, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company and the Trustee shall treat as the Holder of such principal amount of Outstanding Securities represented by a permanent Global Security (i) in the case of a permanent Global Security in registered form, the Holder of such permanent Global Security in registered form, or (ii) in the case of a permanent Global Security in bearer form, Euroclear or Clearstream. Any Global Security authenticated and delivered hereunder shall bear a legend in substantially the following form: 17
"This Security is a Global Security within the meaning set forth in the Indenture hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of a Depository or a nominee of a Depository. This Security is exchangeable for Securities registered in the name of a person other than the Depository or its nominee only in the limited circumstances described in the Indenture, and may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository or by the Depository or its nominee to a successor Depository or its nominee." ARTICLE THREE - THE SECURITIES SECTION 3.01. AMOUNT UNLIMITED; ISSUABLE IN SERIES.

The Securities may be issued in one or more series, each of which shall be authorized pursuant to Board Resolutions of Boston Properties. There shall be established in one or more Board Resolutions or pursuant to authority granted by one or more Board Resolutions and, subject to Section 3.03, set forth in an Officers' Certificate, or established in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, prior to the issuance of Securities of any series: (1) the title of the Securities of the series, including "CUSIP" numbers (which shall distinguish the Securities of such series from all other series of Securities); (2) any limit upon the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of the series that may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture (except for Securities authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Securities of the series pursuant to Section 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 9.06, 11.07 or 13.05) and the minimum authorized denominations with respect to the Securities of such series; (3) the price (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount thereof) at which such Securities will be issued and, if other than the principal amount thereof, the portion of the principal amount thereof payable upon declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof, pursuant to Section 5.02; (4) the date or dates, or the method for determining such date or dates, on which the principal of such Securities will be payable; (5) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or variable), or the method by which such rate or rates shall be determined, at which such Securities will bear interest, if any; (6) the date or dates, or the method for determining such date or dates, from which any such interest will accrue, the Interest Payment Dates on which any such interest will be payable, the Regular Record Dates for such Interest Payment Dates, or the method by which such dates shall be determined, the Persons to whom such interest, if 18
any, shall be payable, and the basis upon which interest shall be calculated if other than that of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months; (7) the Make-Whole Amount, if any, or method for determining the Make-Whole Amount, if any, payable with respect to such Securities, and the terms upon which such amount, if any, will be payable; (8) the place or places where the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and interest, if any, on such Securities will be payable, where such Securities may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices or demands to or upon the Company in respect of such Securities and this Indenture may be served; (9) the period or periods, if any, within which, the price or prices at which and the other terms and conditions upon which such Securities may, pursuant to any optional or mandatory redemption provisions, be redeemed, as a whole or in part, at the option of the Company; (10) the obligation, if any, of the Company to redeem, repay or purchase such Securities pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous provision or at the option of a Holder thereof, and the period or periods within which, the price or prices at which and the other terms and conditions upon which such Securities will be redeemed, repaid or purchased, as a whole or in part, pursuant to such obligation; (11) if other than Dollars, the currency or currencies in which such Securities are denominated and payable, which may be a foreign currency or units of two or more foreign currencies or a composite currency or currencies, the manner of determining the equivalent thereof in Dollars for purposes of the definition of "OUTSTANDING" in Section 1.01, and the terms and conditions relating thereto; (12) whether the amount of payments of principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any, including any amount due upon redemption, if any) or interest, if any, on such Securities may be determined with reference to an index, formula or other method (which index, formula or method may, but need not be, based on the yield on or trading price of other securities, including United States Treasury securities or on a currency, currencies, currency unit or units, or composite currency or currencies) and the manner in which such amounts shall be determined; (13) whether the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest, if any, on the Securities of the series are to be payable, at the election of the Company or a Holder thereof, in a currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies other than that in which such Securities are denominated or stated to be payable, the period or periods within which, and the terms and conditions upon which, such election may be made, and the time and manner of, and identity of the exchange rate agent with responsibility for, determining the exchange rate between the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which such Securities are denominated or stated to be payable and the 19
currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which such Securities are to be so payable; (14) provisions, if any, granting special rights to the Holders of Securities of the series upon the occurrence of such events as may be specified; (15) any deletions from, modifications of or additions to the Events of Default or covenants of the Company with respect to Securities of the series, whether or not such Events of Default or covenants are consistent with the Events of Default or covenants set forth herein; (16) whether and under what circumstances the Company will pay any additional amounts on such Securities in respect of any tax, assessment or governmental charge and, if so, whether the Company will have the option to redeem such Securities in lieu of making such payment; (17) whether Securities of the series are to be issuable as Registered Securities, Bearer Securities (with or without coupons) or both, any restrictions applicable to the offer, sale or delivery of Bearer Securities and the terms upon which Bearer Securities of the series may be exchanged for Registered Securities of the series and vice versa (if permitted by applicable laws and regulations), whether any Securities of the series are to be issuable initially in temporary global form and whether any Securities of the series are to be issuable in permanent global form with or without coupons and, if so, whether beneficial owners of interests in any such permanent global Security may, or shall be required to, exchange such interests for Securities of such series and of like tenor of any authorized form and denomination and the circumstances under which any such exchanges may, or shall be required to, occur, if other than in the manner provided in the Indenture, and, if Registered Securities of the series are to be issuable as a Global Security, the identity of the depository for such series; (18) the date as of which any Bearer Securities of the series and any temporary Global Security representing outstanding Securities of the series shall be dated if other than the date of original issuance of the first Security of the series to be issued; (19) the Person to whom interest, if any, on any Registered Security of the series shall be payable, if other than the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, if any, the manner in which, or the Person to whom, any interest on any Bearer Security of the series shall be payable, if otherwise than upon presentation and surrender of the coupons appertaining thereto as they severally mature, and the extent to which, or the manner in which, interest, if any, payable on a temporary Global Security on an Interest Payment Date will be paid if other than in the manner provided herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, in each case, that the manner of determining such Person or making such payment shall be acceptable to the Trustee (as not imposing on it any undue administrative burden or risk of liability); 20
(20) the applicability, if any, of the defeasance and covenant defeasance provisions of Article Fourteen hereof to the Securities of the series; (21) if the Securities of such series are to be issuable in definitive form (whether upon original issue or upon exchange of a temporary Security of such series) only upon receipt of certain certificates or other documents or satisfaction of other conditions, then the form and/or terms of such certificates, documents or conditions; (22) designation of the Trustee, if different from the Trustee under the Indenture, with respect to such series and the terms applicable to such Trustee (which shall be accepted by such Trustee by its execution and delivery of a supplemental indenture as provided therein); and (23) any other terms of the series (which terms shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture). All Securities of any one series and the coupons appertaining to any Bearer Securities of such series shall be substantially identical except, in the case of Registered Securities, as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to such Board Resolution (subject to Section 3.03) and set forth in such Officers' Certificate or in any such indenture supplemental hereto. All Securities of any one series need not be issued at the same time and, unless otherwise provided, a series may be reopened, without the consent of the Holders, for issuances of additional Securities of such series. If any of the terms of the Securities of any series are established by action taken pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions, a copy of an appropriate record of such action(s) shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of Boston Properties and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of the Securities of such series. SECTION 3.02. DENOMINATIONS. The Securities of each series shall be issuable in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 3.01. With respect to Securities of any series denominated in Dollars, in the absence of any such provisions with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series, other than Global Securities (which may be of any denomination), shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof or the equivalent amounts thereof in the case of Securities denominated in the Foreign Currency or currency unit. SECTION 3.03. EXECUTION, AUTHENTICATION, DELIVERY AND DATING. The Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be executed on behalf of the Company by the Chairman of the Board, the President or one of the Vice Presidents of Boston Properties, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon, and attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities and coupons may be manual or facsimile signatures of the present or any future such authorized officer and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Securities. Securities and coupons bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of Boston Properties shall bind the Company, 21
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities or coupons. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series, together with any coupon appertaining thereto, executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities (accompanied by a copy of the Board Resolution and the Officers' Certificate or supplemental indenture contemplated by Section 3.01), and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, in connection with its original issuance, no Bearer Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States; and PROVIDED FURTHER that, unless otherwise specified with respect to any series of Securities pursuant to Section 3.01, a Bearer Security may be delivered in connection with its original issuance only if the Person entitled to receive such Bearer Security shall have furnished a certificate to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, in the form set forth in EXHIBIT B-1 to this Indenture or such other certificate as may be specified by the Company with respect to any series of Securities pursuant to Section 3.01, dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the earlier of the date on which such Bearer Security is delivered and the date on which any temporary Security first becomes exchangeable for such Bearer Security in accordance with the terms of such temporary Security and this Indenture. If any Security shall be represented by a permanent Global Security, then, for purposes of this Section and Section 3.04, the notation of a beneficial owner's interest therein upon original issuance of such Security or upon exchange of a portion of a temporary Global Security shall be deemed to be delivery in connection with its original issuance of such beneficial owner's interest in such permanent Global Security. Except as permitted by Section 3.06, the Trustee shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security unless all appurtenant coupons for interest then matured have been detached and canceled. If all the Securities of any series are not to be issued at one time and if the Board Resolution or supplemental indenture establishing such series shall so permit, such Company Order may set forth procedures acceptable to the Trustee for the issuance of such Securities and determining the terms of particular Securities of such series, such as interest rate or formula, maturity date, date of issuance and date from which interest shall accrue. In authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be provided with, and (subject to TIA Section 315(a) through 315(d)) shall be fully protected in relying upon, (i) an Opinion of Counsel stating that (a) the form or forms of such Securities and any coupons have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; (b) the terms of such Securities and any coupons have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and (c) such Securities, together with any coupons appertaining thereto, when completed by appropriate insertions and executed and delivered by 22
the Company to the Trustee for authentication in accordance with this Indenture, authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in accordance with this Indenture and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute legal, valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to general equitable principles; and (ii) an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture relating to the issuance of the Securities have been complied with and that, to the best of the knowledge of the signers of such certificate, that no Event of Default with respect to any of the Securities shall have occurred and be continuing. If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities (or to enter into the related supplemental indenture, if applicable) if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties, obligations or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.01 and of the preceding paragraph, if all the Securities of any series are not to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver an Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 3.01 or a Company Order, or an Opinion of Counsel or an Officers' Certificate otherwise required pursuant to the preceding paragraph at the time of issuance of each Security of such series, but such order, opinion and certificates, with appropriate modifications to cover such future issuances, shall be delivered at or before the time of issuance of the first Security of such series. Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication and each Bearer Security shall be dated as of the date specified as contemplated by Section 3.01. No Security or coupon shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security or Security to which such coupon appertains a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein duly executed by the Trustee (subject to Section 6.11) by manual signature of an authorized signatory, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security (including a Global Security) shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 3.09 together with a written statement (which need not comply with Section 1.02 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. 23
SECTION 3.04. TEMPORARY SECURITIES. (a) Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued, in registered form, or, if authorized, in bearer form with one or more coupons or without coupons, and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities. In the case of Securities of any series, such temporary Securities may be in global form. Except in the case of temporary Global Securities (which shall be exchanged as otherwise provided herein or as otherwise provided in or pursuant to a Board Resolution or supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 3.01), if temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series (accompanied by any non-matured coupons appertaining thereto), the Company shall execute (in accordance with a Company Order delivered at or prior to the authentication of the first definitive security to such series) and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and provided FURTHER that a definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Bearer Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 3.03. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series. (b) Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to a Board Resolution or supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 3.01, the following provisions of this Section 3.04(b) shall govern the exchange of temporary Securities other than through the facilities of DTC. If any such temporary Security is issued in global form, then such temporary Global Security shall, unless otherwise provided therein, be delivered to the London office of a depository or common depository upon and pursuant to written direction of the Company (the "COMMON DEPOSITORY"), for the benefit of Euroclear and Clearstream, for credit to the respective accounts of the beneficial owners of such Securities (or to such other accounts as they may direct). Without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the date specified in, or determined pursuant to the terms of, any such temporary Global Security (the "EXCHANGE DATE"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities, in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such temporary Global Security, executed by the Company. On or after the Exchange Date, such temporary Global Security shall be surrendered by the Common Depository to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive Securities without charge, and the Trustee shall 24
authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary Global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such temporary Global Security to be exchanged. The definitive Securities to be delivered in exchange for any such temporary Global Security shall be in bearer form, registered form, permanent global bearer form or permanent global registered form, or any combination thereof, as specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, and, if any combination thereof is so specified, as requested by the beneficial owner thereof (as directed by or pursuant to information provided by the Common Depository); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, unless otherwise specified in such temporary Global Security, upon such presentation by the Common Depository, such temporary Global Security shall be accompanied by a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Euroclear as to the portion of such temporary Global Security held for its account then to be exchanged and a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Clearstream as to the portion of such temporary Global Security held for its account then to be exchanged, each in the form set forth in EXHIBIT B-2 to this Indenture or in such other form as may be established pursuant to Section 3.01; and PROVIDED FURTHER that definitive Bearer Securities shall be delivered in exchange for a portion of a temporary Global Security only in compliance with the requirements of Section 3.03. Unless otherwise specified in such temporary Global Security, the interest of a beneficial owner of Securities of a series in a temporary Global Security shall be exchanged for definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor following the Exchange Date when the account holder instructs Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, to request such exchange on his behalf and delivers to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, a certificate in the form set forth in EXHIBIT B-1 to this Indenture (or in such other form as may be established pursuant to Section 3.01), dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the Exchange Date, copies of which certificate shall be available from the offices of Euroclear and Clearstream, the Trustee, any Authenticating Agent appointed for such series of Securities and each Paying Agent. Unless otherwise specified in such temporary Global Security, any such exchange shall be made free of charge to the beneficial owners of such temporary Global Security, except that a Person receiving definitive Securities must bear the cost of insurance, postage, transportation and the like unless such Person takes delivery of such definitive Securities in person at the offices of Euroclear or Clearstream. Definitive Securities in bearer form to be delivered in exchange for any portion of a temporary Global Security shall be delivered only to an address located outside the United States. Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder, except that, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, interest, if any, payable on a temporary Global Security on an Interest Payment Date for Securities of such series occurring prior to the applicable Exchange Date shall be payable to Euroclear and Clearstream on such Interest Payment Date upon delivery by Euroclear and Clearstream to the Trustee of a certificate or certificates in the form set forth in EXHIBIT B-2 to this Indenture (or in such other forms as may be established pursuant to Section 3.01), for credit without further interest on or after such Interest Payment Date to the respective accounts of Persons who are the beneficial owners of such temporary Global Security on such Interest Payment Date and who have each delivered to 25
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, a certificate dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the Interest Payment Date occurring prior to such Exchange Date in the form set forth as EXHIBIT B-1 to this Indenture (or in such other forms as may be established pursuant to Section 3.01). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, the certifications made pursuant to this paragraph shall satisfy the certification requirements of the preceding two paragraphs of this Section 3.04(b) and of the third paragraph of Section 3.03 of this Indenture and the interests of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of the temporary Global Security with respect to which such certification was made will be exchanged for definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor on the Exchange Date or the date of certification if such date occurs after the Exchange Date, without further act or deed by such beneficial owners. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, no payments of principal or interest, if any, owing with respect to a beneficial interest in a temporary Global Security will be made unless and until such interest in such temporary Global Security shall have been exchanged for an interest in a definitive Security. Any interest so received by Euroclear and Clearstream and not paid as herein provided shall be returned to the Trustee prior to the expiration of two years after such Interest Payment Date in order to be repaid to the Company. With respect to Exhibit B-1 or B-2 to this Indenture, the Company may, in its discretion and if required or desirable under applicable law, substitute one or more other forms of such exhibits for such exhibits, eliminate the requirement that any or all certificate be provided, or change the time that any certificate may be required, PROVIDED THAT such substitute form or forms or notice of elimination or change of such certification requirement have theretofore been delivered to the Trustee with a Company Request and such form or forms, elimination or change is reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. SECTION 3.05. REGISTRATION, REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE. The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or in any office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment a register for each series of Securities (the registers maintained in such office or in any such office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes referred to collectively as the "SECURITY REGISTER") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Registered Securities and of transfers of Registered Securities. The Security Register shall be in written form or any other form capable of being converted into written form within a reasonable time. The Trustee, at its Corporate Trust Office, is hereby initially appointed "SECURITY REGISTRAR" for the purpose of registering Registered Securities and transfers of Registered Securities on such Security Register as herein provided. In the event that the Trustee shall cease to be Security Registrar, it shall have the right to examine, and be provided a copy of, the Security Register at all reasonable times. Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.05, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any series at any office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Registered Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, and containing identical terms and provisions. 26
Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.05, at the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination or denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, containing identical terms and provisions, upon surrender of the Registered Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any such Registered Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Unless otherwise specified with respect to any series of Securities as contemplated by Section 3.01, Bearer Securities may not be issued in exchange for Registered Securities. If (but only if) permitted by the applicable Board Resolution and (subject to Section 3.03) set forth in the applicable Officers' Certificate, or in any indenture supplemental hereto, delivered as contemplated by Section 3.01, at the option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of any series may be exchanged for Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency, with all unmatured coupons and all matured coupons in default thereto appertaining. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such unmatured coupon or coupons or matured coupon or coupons in default, any such permitted exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company (or to the Trustee for the Security in case of matured coupons in default) in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing coupon or coupons, or the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there is furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02, interest, if any, represented by coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons at an office or agency located outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in a permitted exchange for a Registered Security of the same series and like tenor after the close of business at such office or agency on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, and interest, if any, or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, any permanent Global Security shall be exchangeable only as provided in this paragraph. If the depository for any permanent Global Security is DTC, then, unless the terms of such Global Security expressly permit such Global Security to be exchanged in whole or in part for 27
definitive Securities, a Global Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to a nominee of DTC, or by a nominee of DTC to DTC, or to a successor to DTC for such Global Security selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor to DTC. If at any time DTC notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for the applicable Global Security or Securities or if at any time DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, if so required by applicable law or regulation, the Company shall appoint a successor depository with respect to such Global Security or Securities. If (w) a successor depository for such Global Security or Securities is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such unwillingness, inability or ineligibility, (x) the Company delivers to the Trustee for Securities of such series in registered form a Company Order stating that the Securities of such series shall be exchangeable, (y) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the beneficial owners representing a majority in principal amount of the applicable series of Securities represented by such Global Security or Securities advise DTC to cease acting as depository for such Global Security or Securities or (z) the Company, in its sole discretion, determines at any time that all Outstanding Securities (but not less than all) of any series issued or issuable in the form of one or more Global Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities, then the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver definitive Securities of like series, rank, tenor and terms in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Security or Securities. If any beneficial owner of an interest in a permanent global Security is otherwise entitled to exchange such interest for Securities of such series and of like tenor and principal amount of another authorized form and denomination, as specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 and PROVIDED THAT any applicable notice provided in the permanent Global Security shall have been given, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such interest may be so exchanged, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver definitive Securities in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such beneficial owner's interest in such permanent Global Security. On or after the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, such permanent Global Security shall be surrendered for exchange by DTC or such other depository as shall be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such purpose; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such exchanges may occur during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before any selection of Securities to be redeemed and ending on the relevant Redemption Date if the Security for which exchange is requested may be among those selected for redemption; and PROVIDED FURTHER that no Bearer Security delivered in exchange for a portion of a permanent Global Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States. If a Registered Security is issued in exchange for any portion of a permanent Global Security after the close of business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, interest, if any, or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Person to whom interest, if any, in respect of such portion of such permanent Global Security is payable in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. 28
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange or redemption shall (if so required by the Company or the Security Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.04, 9.06, 11.07 or 13.05 not involving any transfer. The Company or the Trustee, as applicable, shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security if such Security may be among those selected for redemption during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before selection of the Securities to be redeemed under Section 11.03 and ending at the close of business on (A) if such Securities are issuable only as Registered Securities, the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption and (B) if such Securities are issuable as Bearer Securities, the day of the first publication of the relevant notice of redemption or, if such Securities are also issuable as Registered Securities and there is no publication, the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Registered Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Registered Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed, or (iii) to exchange any Bearer Security so selected for redemption except that such a Bearer Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of that series and like tenor, PROVIDED THAT such Registered Security shall be simultaneously surrendered for redemption, or (iv) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security which has been surrendered for repayment at the option of the Holder, except the portion, if any, of such Security not to be so repaid. Furthermore, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3.05, the Company will not be required to exchange any Securities if, as a result of the exchange, the Company would suffer adverse consequences under any United States law or regulation. SECTION 3.06. MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST AND STOLEN SECURITIES. If any mutilated Security or a Security with a mutilated coupon appertaining to it is surrendered to the Trustee or the Company, together with, in proper cases, such security or indemnity as may be required by the Company or the Trustee to save each of them or any agent of either of them harmless, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and principal amount, containing identical terms and provisions and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to the surrendered Security. 29
If there shall be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security or coupon, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security or coupon has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for the Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains (with all appurtenant coupons not destroyed, lost or stolen), a new Security of the same series and principal amount, containing identical terms and provisions and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains. Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous two paragraphs, in case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or coupon has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any, appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security to which such destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains, pay such Security or coupon if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee for such Security such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and in the case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company and Trustee and any agent of any of them of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and the ownership thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that payment of principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any), and interest, if any, on, Bearer Securities shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02, be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, any interest on Bearer Securities shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the coupons appertaining thereto. Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. Every new Security of any series with its coupons, if any, issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security, or in exchange for a Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains, shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and its coupons, if any, or the destroyed, lost or stolen coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series and their coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder. The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons. SECTION 3.07. PAYMENT OF INTEREST; INTEREST RIGHTS PRESERVED. Except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.01, 30
interest, if any, on any Registered Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest payment, if any, at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 10.02; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each installment of interest on any Registered Security may at the Company's option be paid by (i) mailing a check for such interest, if any, payable to or upon the written order of the Person entitled thereto pursuant to Section 3.08, to the address of such Person as it appears on the Security Register or (ii) transfer to an account maintained by the payee located inside the United States. Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to the Securities of any series, payment of interest, if any, may be made, in the case of a Bearer Security, by transfer to an account maintained by the payee with a bank located outside the United States. Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 3.01, every permanent Global Security will provide that interest, if any, payable on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, with respect to that portion of such permanent Global Security held for its account by Cede & Co. or the Common Depository, as the case may be, for the purpose of permitting such party to credit the interest received by it in respect of such permanent Global Security to the accounts of the beneficial owners thereof. In case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security of such series after the close of business (at an office or agency in a Place of Payment for such series) on any Regular Record Date and before the opening of business (at such office or agency) on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date and interest will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. Except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.01, interest, if any, on any Registered Security of any series that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "DEFAULTED INTEREST") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder thereof on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below: (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Registered Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Registered Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment (which shall not be less than 20 days after such notice is received by the Trustee), and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or 31
currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for the Securities of such series) equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit on or prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Registered Securities of such series at his address as it appears in the Security Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. The Trustee may, in its discretion, in the name and at the expense of the Company, cause a similar notice to be published at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in each Place of Payment, but such publications shall not be a condition precedent to the establishment of such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Registered Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2). In case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at the office or agency in a Place of Payment for such series in exchange for a Registered Security of such series after the close of business at such office or agency on any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such proposed date of payment and Defaulted Interest will not be payable on such proposed date of payment in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Registered Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 3.05, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security. SECTION 3.08. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or 32
the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Registered Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any), and (subject to Sections 3.05 and 3.07) interest, if any, on, such Registered Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Registered Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to any such Person, or upon such Person's order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for money payable upon any such Security. Title to any Bearer Security and any coupons appertaining thereto shall pass by delivery. The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Holder of any Bearer Security and the Holder of any coupon as the absolute owner of such Security or coupon for the purpose of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security or coupon be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. No holder of any beneficial interest in any Global Security held on its behalf by a depository shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to such Global Security and such depository (which is the Holder of such security) shall be treated by the Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the owner of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Security, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee, or any agent of the Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by any depository, as a Holder, with respect to such Global Security or impair, as between such depository and owners of beneficial interests in such Global Security, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of such depository (or its nominee) as Holder of such Global Security. SECTION 3.09. CANCELLATION. All Securities and coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, repayment at the option of the Holder, registration of transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee, and any such Securities and coupons and Securities and coupons surrendered directly to the Trustee for any such purpose, upon direction by the Company, shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. If the Company shall so acquire any of the Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any 33
Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. Cancelled Securities and coupons held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its customary practices (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act). SECTION 3.10. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 with respect to Securities of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. SECTION 3.11. CUSIP NUMBERS. The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers. ARTICLE FOUR - SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE SECTION 4.01. SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE. This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect with respect to any series of Securities specified in such Company Request (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities of such series herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order, and at the expense of the Company, shall execute instruments in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee and the Company acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as to such series when (1) either (A) all Securities of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered and all coupons, if any, appertaining thereto (other than (i) coupons appertaining to Bearer Securities surrendered for exchange for Registered Securities and maturing after such exchange, whose surrender is not required or has been waived as provided in Section 3.05, (ii) Securities and coupons of such series which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.06, (iii) coupons appertaining to Securities called for redemption and maturing after the relevant Redemption Date, whose surrender has been waived as provided in Section 11.06, and (iv) Securities and coupons of such series for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 10.03) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or 34
(B) all Securities of such series and, in the case of (i) or (ii) below, any coupons appertaining thereto not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, or (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or (iii) if redeemable at the option of the Company, are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an amount in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable, sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities and such coupons not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and interest, if any, to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be; (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture as to such series have been complied with. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.06, the obligations of the Company to any Authenticating Agent under Section 6.11 and, if money shall have been deposited with and held by the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 4.02 and the last paragraph of Section 10.03 shall survive such satisfaction and discharge. SECTION 4.02. APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS. Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.03, all money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.01 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities, the coupons and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any), and interest, if any, for whose payment such money has been deposited with or received by the Trustee, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. 35

"EVENT OF DEFAULT," wherever used herein with respect to any particular series of Securities, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether or not it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (1) default in the payment of interest, if any, on any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or (2) default in the payment of the principal of (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any, on) any Security of that series when it becomes due and payable at its Maturity; or (3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, to the extent applicable to such series of Securities, when and as due by the terms of any Security of that series; or (4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Indenture with respect to any Security of that series (other than a covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of series of Securities other than that series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 60 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "NOTICE OF DEFAULT" hereunder; or (5) a default under any bond, debenture, note, mortgage, indenture (including this Indenture) or other instrument (each, a "DEBT INSTRUMENT"), in each case under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Recourse indebtedness for money borrowed of the Company, having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of at least $50,000,000 (each, a "COMPANY RECOURSE OBLIGATION"), whether such Recourse indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created, which default (A) shall constitute a failure to pay any portion of the principal of such Recourse indebtedness when due and payable at its stated maturity after the expiration of any applicable grace period with respect thereto or (B) shall have resulted in such Recourse indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable prior to its stated maturity, without, in the case of Clause (A), such Recourse indebtedness having been discharged or without, in the case of Clause (B), such Recourse indebtedness having been discharged or such acceleration having been rescinded or annulled, in each such case within a period of 10 days after there shall have been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying 36
such default and requiring the Company to cause such Recourse indebtedness to be discharged or cause such acceleration to be rescinded or annulled, as the case may be, and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; provided, however, that, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.01 and 6.02, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of such default unless either (A) a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have knowledge of such default or (B) the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof from the Company, from any Holder, from the holder of any such Recourse indebtedness or from the trustee under any such mortgage, indenture or other instrument; or (6) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or order adjudging the Company or any Significant Subsidiary a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or (7) the commencement by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of a voluntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, or the filing by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal or State law, or the consent by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary to the filing of such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or of any substantial part of its property, or the making by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of action by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary in furtherance of any such action; or (8) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of that series.

SECTION 5.02. ACCELERATION OF MATURITY; RESCISSION AND ANNULMENT. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if Securities of that Series are Original Issue Discount Securities or Indexed Securities, such portion of the principal as may be specified in the terms thereof) of all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal or specified portion thereof shall become immediately due and payable. At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration of acceleration and its consequences if: (1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay in the currency, currency unit or composite currency in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for the Securities of such series): (A) all overdue installments of interest on all Outstanding Securities of that series and any related coupons, (B) the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any, on) any Outstanding Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest, if any, thereon at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue installments of interest at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, and (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and (2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other than the nonpayment of the principal of (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest, if any, on Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 5.13. 38
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 5.03. COLLECTION OF INDEBTEDNESS AND SUITS FOR ENFORCEMENT BY TRUSTEE. The Company covenants that if: (1) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest on any Security of any series and any related coupon when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any, on) any Security of any series at its Maturity, then the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities of such series and coupons, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities and coupons for principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and interest, if any, with interest upon any overdue principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and, to the extent that payment of such interest, if any, shall be legally enforceable, upon any overdue installments of interest at the rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel. If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities of such series and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities of such series, wherever situated. If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series and any related coupons by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. SECTION 5.04. TRUSTEE MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM. In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities of any series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal, premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any, or interest, if any) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: 39
(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount, or such lesser amount as may be provided for in the Securities of such series, of principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and interest, if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and (ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities of such series and coupons to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee, their agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.06. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Security or coupon any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or coupons or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Security or coupon in any such proceeding. In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and also any proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee shall be held to represent all the Holders of the Securities, and it shall not be necessary to make any Holders of the Securities parties to any such proceedings. SECTION 5.05. TRUSTEE MAY ENFORCE CLAIMS WITHOUT POSSESSION OF SECURITIES OR COUPONS. All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or any of the Securities or coupons may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or coupons or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities and coupons in respect of which such judgment has been recovered. SECTION 5.06. APPLICATION OF MONEY COLLECTED. Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest, if any, upon presentation of the Securities or coupons, or both, as the case may be, and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid: 40
FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 6.06; SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon the Securities and coupons for principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and interest, if any, in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the aggregate amounts due and payable on such Securities and coupons for principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and interest, if any, respectively; and THIRD: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company. SECTION 5.07. LIMITATION ON SUITS. No Holder of any Security of any series or any related coupon shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless: (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series; (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder; (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request; (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders. SECTION 5.08. UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT OF HOLDERS TO RECEIVE PRINCIPAL, PREMIUM OR MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT, IF ANY, AND INTEREST, IF ANY. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security or coupon shall have the right which is absolute and unconditional to receive payment of the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) and (subject to Sections 3.05 and 3.07) interest, if any, on such Security or payment of such coupon on the respective due dates expressed in such Security or coupon (or, in the case of 41
redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. SECTION 5.09. RESTORATION OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. If the Trustee or any Holder of a Security or coupon has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of Securities and coupons shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. SECTION 5.10. RIGHTS AND REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons in the last paragraph of Section 3.06, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities or coupons is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. SECTION 5.11. DELAY OR OMISSION NOT WAIVER. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Security or coupon to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders of Securities or coupons, as the case may be. SECTION 5.12. CONTROL BY HOLDERS OF SECURITIES. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series, PROVIDED THAT: (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction, and (3) the Trustee need not take any action which might involve it in personal liability or be unduly prejudicial to the Holders of Securities of such series not joining therein. Nothing in this Indenture shall impair the right of the Trustee in its discretion to take any action deemed proper by the Trustee and which is not inconsistent with such direction by Holders. 42
SECTION 5.13. WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series and any related coupons waive any past default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default (1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest, if any, on any Security of such series or any related coupons, or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected; or (3) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof for the benefit or protection of the Trustee, without its express written consent. Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. SECTION 5.14. WAIVER OF USURY, STAY OR EXTENSION LAWS. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted. SECTION 5.15. UNDERTAKING FOR COSTS. All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest, if any, on any Security on or after the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date). ARTICLE SIX - THE TRUSTEE SECTION 6.01. NOTICE OF DEFAULTS. Within 90 days after the occurrence of any default hereunder with respect to the Securities of any series, the Trustee shall transmit in the manner 43
and to the extent provided in TIA Section 313(c), notice of such default hereunder known to the Trustee, unless such default shall have been cured or waived; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, except in the case of a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest, if any, on any Security of such series, or in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund installment with respect to the Securities of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a trust committee of directors and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Holders of the Securities and coupons of such series; and PROVIDED FURTHER that in the case of any default or breach of the character specified in Section 5.01(4) with respect to the Securities and coupons of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 60 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "DEFAULT" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series. SECTION 6.02. CERTAIN RIGHTS OF TRUSTEE. Subject to the provisions of TIA Section 315(a) through 315(d): (1) the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, coupon or other paper or document (whether in its original or facsimile form) reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; (2) any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or Company Order (other than delivery of any Security, together with any coupons appertaining thereto, to the Trustee for authentication and delivery pursuant to Section 3.03 which shall be sufficiently evidenced as provided therein) and any resolution of the Board of Directors may be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution; (3) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officers' Certificate; (4) the Trustee may consult with counsel of its own selection and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon; (5) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of Securities of any series or any related coupons pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; 44
(6) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, coupon or other paper or document, unless requested in writing so to do by the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series; PROVIDED THAT, if the payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Trustee may require reasonable indemnity against such expenses or liabilities as a condition to proceeding; the reasonable expenses of every such examination shall be paid by the Holders. The Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company relevant to the facts or matters that are the subject of its inquiry, personally or by agent or attorney at the expense of the Company and shall incur no liability of any kind by reason of such inquiry or investigation; (7) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder; (8) the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith and reasonably believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture; (9) any permissive right or power available to the Trustee under this Indenture or any supplement hereto shall not be construed to be a mandatory duty or obligation; (10) the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any matter (including any default, other than as described in Section 5.01(1), (2) or (3)) unless and except to the extent actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or to the extent written notice thereof is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office; (11) the Trustee shall have no liability for any inaccuracy in the books and records of, or for any actions or omissions of, DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or any depository acting on behalf of any of them; and (12) the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed by the Trustee to act hereunder. SECTION 6.03. NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR RECITALS OR ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES. The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificate of authentication, and in any coupons shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and neither the Trustee nor any 45
Authenticating Agent assumes any responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities or coupons, except that the Trustee represents that it is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Indenture, authenticate the Securities and perform its obligations hereunder. Neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent shall be accountable for the use or application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof. SECTION 6.04. MAY HOLD SECURITIES. The Trustee, any Paying Agent, Security Registrar, Authenticating Agent or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and coupons and, subject to TIA Sections 310(b) and 311, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Paying Agent, Security Registrar, Authenticating Agent or such other agent. SECTION 6.05. MONEY HELD IN TRUST. Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed with the Company. SECTION 6.06. COMPENSATION AND REIMBURSEMENT. The Company agrees: (1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse each of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, and disbursements incurred by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the reasonable expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense or disbursement as shall be determined to have been caused by its own negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith; and (3) to indemnify each of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(6) or Section 5.01(7), the expenses (including the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any applicable Bankruptcy Law. As security for the performance of the obligations of the Company under this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by 46
the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the payment of principal of (or premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest, if any, on particular Securities or any coupons. The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Indenture and resignation or removal of the Trustee. SECTION 6.07. CORPORATE TRUSTEE REQUIRED; ELIGIBILITY; CONFLICTING INTERESTS. There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be eligible to act as Trustee under TIA Section 310(a)(1) and shall have at all times a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If the Trustee publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or the requirements of Federal, state, territorial or District of Columbia supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of the Trustee shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article. Neither the Company nor any Person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Company shall serve as Trustee. SECTION 6.08. RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL; APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR. (a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 6.09. (b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee. (c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Trustee and to the Company. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 60 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee. (d) If at any time: (1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of TIA Section 310(b) after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least 6 months, or (2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 6.07 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least 6 months, or 47
(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then, in any such case, (i) the Company by or pursuant to a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (ii) subject to TIA Section 315(e), any Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least 6 months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees. (e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series). If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders of Securities and accepted appointment in the manner hereinafter provided, any Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least 6 months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to Securities of such series. (f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series in the manner provided for notices to the Holders of Securities in Section 1.06. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office. SECTION 6.09. ACCEPTANCE OF APPOINTMENT BY SUCCESSOR. (a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee, and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property 48
and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, subject nevertheless to its claim, if any, provided for in Section 6.06. (b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto, pursuant to Article Nine hereof, wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. (c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6.09, as the case may be. (d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article. SECTION 6.10. MERGER, CONVERSION, CONSOLIDATION OR SUCCESSION TO BUSINESS. Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities or coupons shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities or coupons so authenticated with the same 49
effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities or coupons. In case any Securities or coupons shall not have been authenticated by such predecessor Trustee, any such successor Trustee may authenticate and deliver such Securities or coupons, in either its own name or that of its predecessor Trustee, with the full force and effect which this Indenture provides for the certificate of authentication of the Trustee. SECTION 6.11. APPOINTMENT OF AUTHENTICATING AGENT. At any time when any of the Securities remain Outstanding, the Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption or repayment thereof, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Any such appointment shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing signed by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, a copy of which instrument shall be promptly furnished to the Company. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a bank or trust company or corporation organized and doing business and in good standing under the laws of the United States of America or of any state or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or state authorities. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. In case at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section. Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent. An Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities may at any time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee for such series and to the Company. The Trustee for any series of Securities may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee for such series may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities 50
of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve in the manner set forth in Section 1.06. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent herein. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section. The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation including reimbursement of its reasonable expenses for its services under this Section, subject to Section 6.06. If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to or in lieu of the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication substantially in the following form: "This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within- mentioned Indenture.

Place of Payment for that series which is located outside the United States, an office or agency where Securities of that series and related coupons may be presented and surrendered for payment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Securities of that series are listed on any stock exchange located outside the United States and such stock exchange shall so require, the Company will maintain a Paying Agent for the Securities of that series in any required city located outside the United States, as the case may be, so long as the Securities of that series are listed on such exchange; and (C) subject to any laws or regulations applicable thereto, in a Place of Payment for that series located outside the United States an office or agency where any Registered Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of each such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, except that Bearer Securities of that series and the related coupons may be presented and surrendered for payment at the offices specified in the Security, in London, England, and the Company hereby appoints the same as its agent to receive such respective presentations, surrenders, notices and demands, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.

The Company may from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies (in or outside the Place of Payment) where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all of such purposes, and may from time to time rescind such designations; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in accordance with the requirements set forth above for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.

SECTION 10.03. MONEY FOR SECURITIES PAYMENTS TO BE HELD IN TRUST. If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of any Securities and any related coupons, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any), or interest, if any, on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for the Securities of such series) sufficient to pay the principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest, if any, so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided, and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities and any related coupons, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any), or interest, if any, on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum (in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies described in the preceding paragraph) sufficient to pay the principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest, if any, so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any, or interest, if any, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will: (1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest, if any, on Securities in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided; (2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any such payment of principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest, if any, on the Securities of that series; and (3) at any time during the continuance of any such default upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent. 60
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such sums. Except as otherwise provided in the Securities of any series, and subject to applicable laws, any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest, if any, on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for 2 years after such principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest, if any, has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company upon Company Request or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment of such principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) or interest, if any, on any Security, without interest thereon, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in an Authorized Newspaper, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

SECTION 10.09. WAIVER OF CERTAIN COVENANTS. The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in Sections 10.04 to 10.08, inclusive, if before or after the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of all outstanding Securities of such series, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such covenant or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such covenant or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.

SECTION 11.02. ELECTION TO REDEEM; NOTICE TO TRUSTEE. The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by or pursuant to a Board Resolution. In case of any 62
redemption at the election of the Company of less than all of the Securities of any series, the Company shall, at least 45 days prior to the giving of the notice of redemption in Section 11.04 (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction. Section 11.03. SELECTION BY TRUSTEE OF SECURITIES TO BE REDEEMED. If less than all the Securities of any series issued on the same day with the same terms are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series issued on such date with the same terms not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Security Registrar (if other than itself) in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed. SECTION 11.04. NOTICE OF REDEMPTION. Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section 1.06, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, unless a shorter period is specified by the terms of such series established pursuant to Section 3.01, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, but failure to give such notice in the manner herein provided to the Holder of any Security designated for redemption as a whole or in part, or any defect in the notice to any such Holder, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other such Security or portion thereof. Any notice that is mailed to the Holders of Registered Securities in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. All notices of redemption shall state: (1) the Redemption Date, (2) the Redemption Price, accrued interest to the Redemption Date payable as provided in Section 11.06, if any, 63
(3) if less than all Outstanding Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amount) of the particular Security or Securities to be redeemed, (4) in case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice which relates to such Security shall state that on and after the Redemption Date, upon surrender of such Security, the holder will receive, without a charge, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations for the principal amount thereof remaining unredeemed, (5) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price and accrued interest to the Redemption Date payable as provided in Section 11.06, if any, will become due and payable upon each such Security, or the portion thereof, to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon shall cease to accrue on and after said date, (6) the Place or Places of Payment where such Securities, together in the case of Bearer Securities with all coupons appertaining thereto, if any, maturing after the Redemption Date, are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any, (7) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case, (8) that, unless otherwise specified in such notice, Bearer Securities of any series, if any, surrendered for redemption must be accompanied by all coupons maturing subsequent to the date fixed for redemption or the amount of any such missing coupon or coupons will be deducted from the Redemption Price, unless security or indemnity satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee for such series and any Paying Agent is furnished, (9) if Bearer Securities of any series are to be redeemed and any Registered Securities of such series are not to be redeemed, and if such Bearer Securities may be exchanged for Registered Securities not subject to redemption on this Redemption Date pursuant to Section 3.05 or otherwise, the last date, as determined by the Company, on which such exchanges may be made, and (10) the CUSIP number of such Security, if any. Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. SECTION 11.05. DEPOSIT OF REDEMPTION PRICE. On or prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, which it may not do in the case of a sinking fund payment under Article Twelve, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 10.03) an amount of money in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for the Securities of such series) sufficient to pay on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price of, 64
and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities or portions thereof which are to be redeemed on that date. SECTION 11.06. SECURITIES PAYABLE ON REDEMPTION DATE. Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for the Securities of such series) (together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date), and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any) such Securities shall, if the same were interest-bearing, cease to bear interest and the coupons for such interest appertaining to any Bearer Securities so to be redeemed, except to the extent provided below, shall be void. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, together with all coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the Redemption Date, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that installments of interest, if any, on Bearer Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02) and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, only upon presentation and surrender of coupons for such interest; and PROVIDED FURTHER that installments of interest, if any, on Registered Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.07. If any Bearer Security surrendered for redemption shall not be accompanied by all appurtenant coupons maturing after the Redemption Date, such Security may be paid after deducting from the Redemption Price an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing coupons, or the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the Redemption Price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that interest represented by coupons shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02) and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate borne by the Security. SECTION 11.07. SECURITIES REDEEMED IN PART. Any Registered Security which is to be redeemed only in part (pursuant to the provisions of this Article or of Article Twelve) shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing) and the 65
Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered. If a Global Security is so surrendered, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the depository, without service charge, a new Global Security in a denomination equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Global Security so surrendered. ARTICLE TWELVE - SINKING FUNDS SECTION 12.01. APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE. The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01 for Securities of such series. The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "MANDATORY SINKING FUND PAYMENT," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of such Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "OPTIONAL SINKING FUND PAYMENT." If provided for by the terms of any Securities of any series, the cash amount of any mandatory sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 12.02. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series. SECTION 12.02. SATISFACTION OF SINKING FUND PAYMENTS WITH SECURITIES. The Company may, in satisfaction of all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of a series, (1) deliver Outstanding Securities of such series (other than any previously called for redemption) together in the case of any Bearer Securities of such series with all unmatured coupons appertaining thereto and (2) apply as a credit Securities of such series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, as provided for by the terms of such Securities, or which have otherwise been acquired by the Company; PROVIDED THAT such Securities so delivered or applied as a credit have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the applicable Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. SECTION 12.03. REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES FOR SINKING FUND. Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for Securities of any series, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for the Securities of such series) and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 12.02, and the optional amount, if any, to be added in cash to the next ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment, and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered and credited. If such Officers' Certificate shall specify an optional amount to be added in cash to the next 66
ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment, the Company shall thereupon be obligated to pay the amount therein specified. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 11.03 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 11.04. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Sections 11.06 and 11.07. ARTICLE THIRTEEN - REPAYMENT AT THE OPTION OF HOLDERS SECTION 13.01. APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE. Repayment of Securities of any series before their Stated Maturity at the option of Holders thereof shall be made in accordance with the terms of such Securities, if any, and (except as otherwise specified by the terms of such series established pursuant to Section 3.01) in accordance with this Article. SECTION 13.02. REPAYMENT OF SECURITIES. Securities of any series subject to repayment in whole or in part at the option of the Holders thereof will, unless otherwise provided in the terms of such Securities, be repaid at a price equal to the principal amount thereof, together with interest, if any, thereon accrued to the Repayment Date specified in or pursuant to the terms of such Securities. The Company covenants that on or prior to the Repayment Date it will deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 10.03) an amount of money in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01 for the Securities of such series) sufficient to pay the principal (or, if so provided by the terms of the Securities of any series, a percentage of the principal) of, and (except if the Repayment Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities or portions thereof, as the case may be, to be repaid on such date. SECTION 13.03. EXERCISE OF OPTION. Securities of any series subject to repayment at the option of the Holders thereof will contain an "OPTION TO ELECT REPAYMENT" form on the reverse of such Securities. In order for any Security to be repaid at the option of the Holder, the Trustee must receive at the Place of Payment therefor specified in the terms of such Security (or at such other place or places of which the Company shall from time to time notify the Holders of such Securities) not earlier than 60 days nor later than 30 days prior to the Repayment Date (1) the Security so providing for such repayment together with the "Option to Elect Repayment" form on the reverse thereof duly completed by the Holder (or by the Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing) or (2) a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or a letter from a member of a national securities exchange, or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States setting forth the name of the Holder of the Security, the principal amount of the Security, the principal amount of the Security to be repaid, the CUSIP number, if any, or a description of the tenor and terms of the Security, a statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised thereby and a guarantee that the Security to be repaid, together with the duly completed form entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" on the reverse of the Security, will be received by the Trustee not later than 67
the fifth Business Day after the date of such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter shall only be effective if such Security and form duly completed are received by the Trustee by such fifth Business Day. If less than the entire principal amount of such Security is to be repaid in accordance with the terms of such Security, the principal amount of such Security to be repaid, in increments of the minimum denomination for Securities of such series, and the denomination or denominations of the Security or Securities to be issued to the Holder for the portion of the principal amount of such Security surrendered that is not to be repaid, must be specified. The principal amount of any Security providing for repayment at the option of the Holder thereof may not be repaid in part if, following such repayment, the unpaid principal amount of such Security would be less than the minimum authorized denomination of Securities of the series of which such Security to be repaid is a part. Except as otherwise may be provided by the terms of any Security providing for repayment at the option of the Holder thereof, exercise of the repayment option by the Holder shall be irrevocable unless waived by the Company. SECTION 13.04. WHEN SECURITIES PRESENTED FOR REPAYMENT BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE. If Securities of any series providing for repayment at the option of the Holders thereof shall have been surrendered as provided in this Article and as provided by or pursuant to the terms of such Securities, such Securities or the portions thereof, as the case may be, to be repaid shall become due and payable and shall be paid by the Company on the Repayment Date therein specified, and on and after such Repayment Date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such Securities on such Repayment Date) such Securities shall, if the same were interest-bearing, cease to bear interest and the coupons for such interest appertaining to any Bearer Securities so to be repaid, except to the extent provided below, shall be void. Upon surrender of any such Security for repayment in accordance with such provisions, together with all coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the Repayment Date, the principal amount of such Security so to be repaid shall be paid by the Company, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Repayment Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that coupons whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Repayment Date shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02) and, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 3.01, only upon presentation and surrender of such coupons; and PROVIDED FURTHER that, in the case of Registered Securities, installments of interest, if any, whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Repayment Date shall be payable (but without interest thereon, unless the Company shall default in the payment thereof) to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.07. If any Bearer Security surrendered for repayment shall not be accompanied by all appurtenant coupons maturing after the Repayment Date, such Security may be paid after deducting from the amount payable therefor as provided in Section 13.02 an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing coupons, or the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made as provided in the preceding sentence, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; PROVIDED, 68
HOWEVER, that interest, if any, represented by coupons shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 10.02) and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.01, only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons. If the principal amount of any Security surrendered for repayment shall not be so repaid upon surrender thereof, such principal amount (together with interest, if any, thereon accrued to such Repayment Date) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Repayment Date at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) set forth in such Security. SECTION 13.05. SECURITIES REPAID IN PART. Upon surrender of any Registered Security which is to be repaid in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security, without service charge and at the expense of the Company, a new Registered Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denomination specified by the Holder, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the portion of the principal of such Security so surrendered which is not to be repaid. ARTICLE FOURTEEN - DEFEASANCE AND COVENANT DEFEASANCE SECTION 14.01. APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE: COMPANY'S OPTION TO EFFECT DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE.

SECTION 14.02. DEFEASANCE AND DISCHARGE. Upon the Company's exercise of the above option applicable to this Section with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto on the date the conditions set forth in Section 14.04 are satisfied (hereinafter, "DEFEASANCE"). For this purpose, such defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, which shall thereafter be deemed to be Outstanding only for the purposes of Section 14.05 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in clauses (A) and (B) below, and to have satisfied all of its other obligations under such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture insofar as such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (A) the rights of Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 14.04 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of (and premium or Make-Whole Amount, if any) 69

Subject to compliance with this Article Fourteen, the Company may exercise its option under this Section notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 14.03 with respect to such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto. SECTION 14.03. COVENANT DEFEASANCE. Upon the Company's exercise of the above option applicable to this Section with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall be released from its obligations under Sections 10.04 to 10.09, inclusive, and, if specified pursuant to Section 3.01, its obligations under any other covenant contained herein or in any indenture supplemental hereto, with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 14.04 are satisfied (hereinafter, "COVENANT DEFEASANCE"), and such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto shall thereafter be deemed to be not Outstanding for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or Act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with Sections 10.04 to 10.09, inclusive, or such other covenant, but shall continue to be deemed Outstanding for all other purposes hereunder. For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such Section or such other covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or such other covenant or by reason of reference in any such Section or such other covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a default or an Event of Default under Section 5.01(4) to 5.01(8), inclusive, or otherwise, as the case may be, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be unaffected thereby.

(e) In the case of an election under Section 14.03, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred.
