DEFINITIONS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This section contains a brief explanation of certain non-GAAP financial measures we provide in other sections of this document, and a statement of the reasons why management believes these measures provide useful information to investors about the company's financial condition or results of operations. Additional detail can be found in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time. Funds from Operations: Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), we calculate Funds from Operations, or "FFO," by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), including non-recurring items), for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. In addition to FFO (as defined by NAREIT), we also disclose FFO after specific supplemental adjustments. Although our FFO as adjusted clearly differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO as well that of other real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful presentation of our operating performance. In addition, we believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO as adjusted should be compared with our reported net income and cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we make adjustments to FFO, as defined by NAREIT, including net derivative losses and early surrender lease adjustments. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) In addition to FFO, we present Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) by (1) adding to FFO non-real estate depreciation, (2) eliminating the effect of straight-line rent, and (3) subtracting: recurring capital expenditures; hotel improvements, equipment upgrades and replacements; and second generation tenant improvement and leasing commissions. Although our FAD as adjusted differs from that of other real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful indicator of our ability to fund cash needs and to make cash distributions to equity owners. In addition, we believe that to further understand our liquidity, FAD should be compared with our cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Our computation of FAD may not be comparable to FAD reported by other REITs or real estate companies and FAD does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of our liquidity. Debt to Total Market Capitalization Ratio Debt to total market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. Total market capitalization is the sum of our total indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis (excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt) and the market value of our outstanding equity securities calculated using the closing stock price per share of common stock of the company multiplied by the sum of (i) the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of our operating partnership (including common partnership units held by the company) and (ii) the number of common partnership units issuable upon conversion of preferred partnership units of our operating partnership. We are presenting this ratio because our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. Investors should understand that our debt to market capitalization ratio is in part a function of the market price of the common stock of Boston Properties, Inc., and as such will fluctuate with changes in such price and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like ours, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the debt to total market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with the ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts and other financial ratios, as well as the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.

BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS
BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (1) (1) Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment TshsflowsNinEIT"), we calculate Funds from Operations, or "FFO," by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), including non-recurring items), for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. In addition to FFO (as defined by NAREIT), we also disclose FFO after specific supplemental adjustments. Although our FFO as adjusted clearly differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO as well that of other real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful presentation of our operating performance. In addition, we believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO as adjusted should be compared with our reported net income and ca Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we make adjustments to FFO, as defined by NAREIT, including net derivative losses and early surrender lease adjustments. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), as a measure of our liquidity, or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. (2) Represents cash received under contractual obligations.
