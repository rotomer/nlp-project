Exhibit 99.2
Boston, MA
May 13, 2003Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE: BXP), a real estate investment trust, announced today that its operating partnership, Boston Properties Limited Partnership, has priced an offering of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.000% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2015. The notes were priced at 99.329% of their face amount to yield 5.075%.
The guidance we provided on our April 23, 2003 conference call did not contemplate this offering. The proceeds from this offering will be used primarily to repay short-term floating rate debt, which will reduce our floating rate debt to 5.4% of total debt, all of which will be represented by construction loans. The estimated increase in 2003 net interest expense after giving effect to the use of proceeds will be approximately $3.5 million.
The notes have been offered only to qualified institutional buyers in the United States under Rule144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and certain investors outside of the United States under Regulation S under the Securities Act. The offering of the notes has not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and the notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. In connection with the offering, the Company has agreed, subject to certain terms and conditions, to subsequently file an exchange offer registration statement under the Securities Act in order to effect the exchange of the unregistered notes for substantially identical registered notes.
This press release does not and will not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the notes. This press release is being issued pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 135c under the Securities Act.
