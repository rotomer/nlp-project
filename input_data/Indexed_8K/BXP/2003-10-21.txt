Exhibit 99.1
        This supplemental package contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws. You can identify these statements by our use of the words "expects," "plans," "estimates," "projects," "intends," "believes" and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters. You should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond Boston Properties' control and could materially affect actual results, performance or achievements. These factors include, without limitation, the ability to enter into new leases or renew leases on favorable terms, dependence on tenants' financial condition, the uncertainties of real estate development and acquisition activity, the ability to effectively integrate acquisitions, the costs and availability of financing, the effects of local economic and market conditions, the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on period-to-period comparisons of financial results, regulatory changes and other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake a duty to update forward-looking statements, including its expected operating results for the fourth quarter of 2003 and the full year of 2004.
        Boston Properties, Inc. (the "Company"), a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT), is one of the largest owners, managers and developers of first-class office properties in the United States, with a significant presence in four core markets: Boston, Washington, D.C., Midtown Manhattan and San Francisco. Boston Properties was founded in 1970 by Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde in Boston, where it maintains its headquarters. The Company acquires, develops and manages its properties through full-service regional offices in Boston, New York City, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Princeton, New Jersey. Its property portfolio primarily comprises first-class office space and also includes hotels and industrial buildings. Boston Properties is well known for its in-house building management expertise and responsiveness to tenants' needs.
        The Boston Properties Management Team is among the most distinguished in the REIT industry. This deep and talented team of twenty-eight individuals average twenty-four years of real estate experience and fifteen years with Boston Properties. Chairman Mortimer Zuckerman is nationally known, serving as Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of U.S. News and World Report and Chairman and Publisher of the New York Daily News. He holds an undergraduate degree from McGill University, a law degree from Harvard University and an MBA from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. President and CEO Edward Linde serves on a number of corporate and philanthropic boards, including John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. the Boston Symphony Orchestra, National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) and The Real Estate Roundtable. He holds a B.S. Civil Engineering degree from MIT and an MBA with high distinction as a Baker Scholar from Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.
        Boston Properties' primary business objective is to maximize return on investment in an effort to provide its stockholders with the greatest possible total return. The Company's targeted markets are characterized by high barriers to the creation of new supply and strong real estate fundamentals where tenants have demonstrated a preference for high-quality office buildings and other facilities. Boston Properties' business strategy includes selectively acquiring assets which increase its penetration in the markets in which it has chosen to concentrate while exploring the sale of properties to take advantage of its value creation and the demand for its premier properties, which often results in high sale prices. The Company continues to enhance its balanced capital structure through its access to a variety of sources of capital. Additionally, Boston Properties is an investment grade rated company maintaining current senior unsecured debt ratings of BBB from Standard & Poor's, Baa2 from Moody's Investor Services and BBB from Fitch Ratings.

Please note that any opinions, estimates or forecasts regarding Boston Properties' performance made by the analysts listed above do not represent the opinions, estimates or forecasts of Boston Properties or its management.

        In the fourth quarter of 2002 the Company's operating partnership received investment grade ratings on its senior unsecured debt securities and thereafter issued unsecured notes. The notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of December 13, 2002, by and between Boston Properties Limited Partnership and The Bank of New York, as trustee, as supplemented, which, among other things, requires us to comply with the following limitations on incurrence of debt: Limitation on Outstanding Debt; Limitation on Secured Debt; Ratio of Annualized Consolidated EBITDA to Annualized Interest Expense; and Maintenance of Unencumbered Assets. Compliance with these restrictive covenants requires us to apply specialized terms the meanings of which are described in detail in our filings with the SEC, and to calculate ratios in the manner prescribed by the indenture.
        This section presents such ratios as of September 30, 2003 to show that the Company's operating partnership was in compliance with the terms of the indenture, as amended, which has been filed with the SEC. Management is not presenting these ratios and the related calculations for any other purpose or for any other period, and is not intending for these measures to otherwise provide information to
investors about the Company's financial condition or results of operations. Investors should not rely on these measures other than for purposes of testing our compliance with the indenture.

        This section contains a brief explanation of certain non-GAAP financial measures we provide in other sections of this document, and a statement of the reasons why management believes these measures provide useful information to investors about the company's financial condition or results of operations. Additional detail can be found in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time.
Funds from Operations:
        Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), we calculate Funds from Operations, or "FFO," by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), including non-recurring items), for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial, improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing the comparative operating and financial performance of the Company because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.
        Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO after specific supplemental adjustments, including net derivative losses and early surrender lease adjustments. Although our FFO as adjusted clearly differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO, as well as that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO as adjusted should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.
Funds Available for Distribution (FAD)
        In addition to FFO, we present Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) by (1) adding to FFO non-real estate depreciation, (2) eliminating the effect of straight-line rent, and (3) subtracting: recurring capital expenditures; hotel improvements, equipment upgrades and replacements; and second generation tenant improvement and leasing commissions. In addition, this calculation includes all non-cash compensation expense related to restricted securities. Although our FAD as adjusted differs from that of other real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful indicator of our ability to fund cash needs and to make cash distributions to equity owners. In addition, we believe that to further understand our liquidity, FAD should be compared with our cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements. Our computation of FAD may not be comparable to FAD reported by other REITs or real estate companies and FAD does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an
alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of our liquidity.
Debt to Total Market Capitalization Ratio
        Debt to total market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. Total market capitalization is the sum of our total indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis (excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt) and the market value of our outstanding equity securities calculated using the closing stock price per share of common stock of the company multiplied by the sum of (1) the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of our operating partnership (including common partnership units held by the company) and (2) the number of common partnership units issuable upon conversion of preferred partnership units of our operating partnership. We are presenting this ratio because our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. Investors should understand that our debt to total market capitalization ratio is in part a function of the market price of the common stock of Boston Properties, Inc., and as such will fluctuate with changes in such price and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like ours, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the debt to total market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with the ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts and other financial ratios, as well as the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.

Exhibit 99.2
BOSTON, MA, October 21, 2003Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE: BXP)
, a real estate investment trust, today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003.
Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 were $99.1 million, or $1.02 per share basic and $0.98 per share diluted before the application of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. This compares to FFO of $99.0 million, or $1.04 per share basic and $1.00 per share diluted for the quarter ended September 30, 2002. The weighted average number of basic and diluted shares outstanding totaled 97,360,498 and 107,231,333, respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 and 94,903,894 and 105,724,729, respectively, for the same quarter last year.
Net income available to common shareholders per share (EPS) for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 was $0.48 basic and $0.48 on a diluted basis. This compares to EPS for the third quarter of 2002 of $0.75 basic and $0.74 on a diluted basis. EPS for the third quarter of 2003 includes a charge of ($0.10) for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" and $0.02 related to a gain on sale of real estate and other assets. EPS for the third quarter of 2002 included $0.19 related to gains on sales of real estate and discontinued operations. Excluding the impact of these items, diluted EPS was $0.56 for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 compared to $0.55 for the third quarter of 2002.
The reported results are unaudited and there can be no assurance that the results will not vary from the final information for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of these reported results have been made.
As of September 30, 2003, the Company's portfolio consisted of 139 properties comprising more than 43.5 million square feet, including three properties under construction totaling 2.0 million square feet. The overall percentage of leased space for the properties in service as of September 30, 2003 was 92.2%.
Significant events of the third quarter include:
 - 
On August 5, 2003, the Company acquired the remaining outside interests in its One Freedom Square and Two Freedom Square joint venture properties located in Reston, Virginia for an aggregate of $36.0 million of cash and the assumption of the outside partner's share of the mortgage debt on the properties of approximately $56.4 million and $35.4 million, respectively. Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company repaid in full the mortgage debt on the Two Freedom Square property totaling $70.7 million. For 2004, the Company projects these
properties' combined Unleveraged FFO Return to be 10.8% and Unleveraged Cash Return to be 9.8%. The calculation of these returns and related disclosures are presented on the accompanying table entitled "Projected 2004 Returns on Acquisitions." There can be no assurances that actual returns will not differ materially from these projections. Also on August 5, 2003, the Company acquired a 5.2-acre parcel of land in Reston, Virginia for $13.5 million of cash. The site will support approximately 507,000 square feet of commercial development.
 - 
On August 12, 2003, Boston Properties Limited Partnership, the Company's Operating Partnership, exercised its redemption right and caused all of the outstanding Series One Preferred Units to be converted into common Operating Partnership units.

On September 4, 2003, the Company modified an $87.9 million mortgage loan that is secured by the 601 and 651 Gateway Boulevard properties in South San Francisco, California. The loan bore interest at 8.40% per annum and was scheduled to mature on October 1, 2010. In connection with the modification, the Company repaid $5.7 million of principal. The modified mortgage loan of $82.2 million requires monthly payments equal to the net cash flow from the property which will be allocated first to interest based on a rate of 3.50% per annum with the remainder applied to principal. The modified mortgage loan matures on September 1, 2006.

On September 9, 2003, the Company completed registered exchange offers for its 5.625% senior notes due 2015 and 5.00% senior notes due 2015, as required by agreements with the initial purchasers of the notes. The exchanges did not involve any changes in principal amount, interest rate or other terms of the notes.

On September 11, 2003, the Company entered into a joint venture with an unaffiliated third party to pursue the development of a Class A office property at 801 New Jersey Avenue in Washington, D.C. that would support approximately 1.1 million square feet of commercial development. The Company made an initial cash contribution of $3.0 million for a 50% interest in the joint venture.
Effective July 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 150 "Accounting for Certain Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity," which establishes a new standard for reclassifying certain financial instruments (e.g., minority interest in equity of consolidated joint ventures) from either equity or mezzanine presentation to liabilities. The liability is initially measured at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value of the instruments recognized through earnings. SFAS No. 150 requires the minority interest in equity of one of the Company's consolidated joint ventures to be reflected at fair value. Accordingly upon adoption of SFAS No. 150, the Company recognized a non-cash charge of $9.8 million (net of minority interest in Operating Partnership's share of $2.2 million) to account for the cumulative effect of adjusting the venture partner's outside minority interest to fair value. Under SFAS No. 150, the Company is not permitted to recognize its share of appreciation in the venture's net assets until later realized through sale or liquidation.
Transactions completed subsequent to September 30, 2003:

On October 8, 2003, the Company acquired 1333 New Hampshire Avenue, a 320,000 square foot Class A office property in Washington, D.C. at a purchase price of approximately $111.6 million. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility and available cash. The property is 100% leased. For 2004, the Company projects this property's Unleveraged FFO Return to be 10.6% and Unleveraged Cash Return to be 8.2%. The calculation of these returns and related disclosures are presented on the accompanying table entitled "Projected 2004 Returns on Acquisitions." There can be no assurances that actual returns will not differ materially from these projections.

Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), we calculate Funds from Operations, or "FFO," by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), including non-recurring items), for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial, improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing the comparative operating and financial performance of the Company because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.
Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO after specific supplemental adjustments, including net derivative losses and early surrender lease adjustments. Although our FFO as adjusted clearly differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO, as well as that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO as adjusted should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.

Unleveraged FFO Return is determined by dividing Unleveraged FFO by Total Investment. Other real estate companies may calculate this return differently. Management believes projected Unleveraged FFO Return is a useful measure in the real estate industry when determining the appropriate purchase price for a property or estimating a property's value. When evaluating acquisition opportunities, management considers, among other factors, projected Unleveraged FFO Return because it excludes, among other items, interest expense (which may vary depending on the level of corporate debt or proprety-specific debt), as well as depreciation and amortization expense (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates) In addition, management considers its cost of capital and available financing alternatives in making decisions concerning acquisitions.
(2)
Unleveraged Cash Return is determined by dividing Unleveraged Cash by Total Investment. Other real estate companies may calculate this return differently. Management believes that projected Unleveraged Cash Return is also a useful measure of a property's value when used in addition to Unleveraged FFO Return because it eliminates the effect of straight-lining of rent and the FAS 141 treatment of in-place above and below market leases which over the forecasted period enables an investor to assess the cash on cash return from the property.
(3)
Does not include approximately $1.3 million of free rent granted to a tenant for the first four months of 2004.
        Management is presenting these projected returns and related calculations to assist investors in analyzing the Company's recent acquisitions. Management does not intend to present this data for any other purpose, for any other period or for its other properties, and is not intending for these measures to otherwise provide information to investors about the Company's financial condition or results of operations. The Company does not undertake a duty to update any of these projections.
