This supplemental package contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal securities laws.  You can identify these statements by our use of the words "expects," "plans," "estimates," "projects," "intends," "believes" and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters.  You should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond Boston Properties' control and could materially affect actual results, performance or achievements.  These factors include, without limitation, the ability to enter into new leases or renew leases on favorable terms, dependence on tenants' financial condition, the uncertainties of real estate development and acquisition activity, the ability to effectively integrate acquisitions, the costs and availability of financing, the effects of local economic and market conditions, the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on period-to-period comparisons of financial results, regulatory changes and other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Company does not undertake a duty to update forward-looking statements.
 
 
 
Boston Properties, Inc. (the "Company"), a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT), is one of the largest owners, managers and developers of first-class office properties in the United States, with a significant presence in four core markets:  Boston, Washington, D.C., Midtown Manhattan and San Francisco.  Boston Properties was founded in 1970 by Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde in Boston, where it maintains its headquarters.  The Company acquires, develops and manages its properties through full-service regional offices in Boston, New York City, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Princeton, New Jersey.  Its property portfolio primarily comprises first-class office space and also includes hotels and industrial buildings.  Boston Properties is well known for its in-house building management expertise and responsiveness to tenants' needs.
 
The Boston Properties Management Team is among the most distinguished in the REIT industry.  This deep and talented team of twenty-eight individuals average twenty-four years of real estate experience and fifteen years with Boston Properties.  Chairman Mortimer Zuckerman is nationally known, serving as Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of U.S. News and World Report and Chairman and Publisher of the New York Daily News.  He holds an undergraduate degree from McGill University, a law degree from Harvard University and an MBA from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.  President and CEO Edward Linde serves on a number of corporate and philanthropic boards, including John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. the Boston Symphony Orchestra, National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) and The Real Estate Roundtable.   He holds a B.S. Civil Engineering degree from MIT and an MBA with high distinction as a Baker Scholar from Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.
 
Boston Properties' primary business objective is to maximize return on investment in an effort to provide its stockholders with the greatest possible total return.  The Company's targeted markets are characterized by high barriers to the creation of new supply and strong real estate fundamentals where tenants have demonstrated a preference for high-quality office buildings and other facilities. Boston Properties' business strategy includes selectively acquiring assets which increase its penetration in the markets in which it has chosen to concentrate while exploring the sale of properties to take advantage of its value creation and the demand for its premier properties, which often results in high sale prices.  The Company continues to enhance its balanced capital structure through its access to a variety of sources of capital. Additionally, Boston Properties is an investment grade rated company maintaining current senior unsecured debt ratings of BBB from Standard & Poor's, Baa2 from Moody's Investor Services and BBB from Fitch Ratings.

In the fourth quarter of 2002 the Company's operating partnership received investment grade ratings on its senior unsecured debt securities and thereafter issued unsecured notes.  The notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of December 13, 2002, by and between Boston Properties Limited Partnership and The Bank of New York, as trustee, as supplemented, which, among other things, requires us to comply with the following limitations on incurrence of debt: Limitation on Outstanding Debt; Limitation on Secured Debt; Ratio of Annualized Consolidated EBITDA to Annualized Interest Expense; and Maintenance of Unencumbered Assets.  Compliance with these restrictive covenants requires us to apply specialized terms the meanings of which are described in detail in our filings with the SEC, and to calculate ratios in the manner prescribed by the indenture.
 
This section presents such ratios as of December 31, 2003 to show that the Company's operating partnership was in compliance with the terms of the indenture, as amended, which has been filed with the SEC.  This section also presents certain other indenture-related data which we believe assists investors in the Company's unsecured debt securities.  Management is not presenting these ratios and the related calculations for any other purpose or for any other period, and is not intending for these measures to otherwise provide information to investors about the Company's financial condition or results of operations.  Investors should not rely on these measures other than for purposes of testing our compliance with the indenture.

This section contains a brief explanation of certain non-GAAP financial measures we provide in other sections of this document, and a statement of the reasons why management believes these measures provide useful information to investors about the company's financial condition or results of operations.  Additional detail can be found in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time.
 
Funds from Operations:
 
Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), we calculate Funds from Operations, or "FFO," by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), including non-recurring items), for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial, improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing the comparative operating and financial performance of the Company because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.
 
Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO after specific supplemental adjustments, including net derivative losses and early surrender lease adjustments.  Although our FFO as adjusted clearly differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO, as well as that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO as adjusted should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.
 
Funds Available for Distribution (FAD)
 
In addition to FFO, we present Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) by (1) adding to FFO non-real estate depreciation, (2) eliminating the effect of straight-line rent, and (3) subtracting: recurring capital expenditures; hotel improvements, equipment upgrades and replacements; and second generation tenant improvement and leasing commissions.  In addition, this calculation includes all non-cash compensation expense related to restricted securities.  Although our FAD as adjusted differs from that of other real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful indicator of our ability to fund cash needs and to make cash distributions to equity owners.  In addition, we believe that to further understand our liquidity, FAD should be compared with our cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.  Our computation of FAD may not be comparable to FAD reported by other REITs or real estate companies and FAD does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), or as a measure of our liquidity.
 
Debt to Total Market Capitalization Ratio
 
Debt to total market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector.  Total market capitalization is the sum of our total indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis (excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt) and the market value of our outstanding equity securities calculated using the closing stock price per share of common stock of the company multiplied by the sum of (1) the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of our operating partnership (including common partnership units held by the company) and (2) the number of common partnership units issuable upon conversion of preferred partnership units of our operating partnership.  We are presenting this ratio because our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes.  Investors should understand that our debt to total market capitalization ratio is in part a function of the market price of the common stock of Boston Properties, Inc., and as such will fluctuate with changes in such price and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations.  However, for a company like ours, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the debt to total market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with the ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts and other financial ratios, as well as the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.
 
Net Operating Income (NOI)
 
NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus corporate general and adminstrative expense, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, minority interest in Operating Partnership, net derivative losses and losses from early extinguishment of debt, less interest income, development and management income, gains from property dispositions, gains on sale from discontinued operations, income from discontinued operations, income from unconsolidated joint ventures and minority interest in property partnerships.  In some cases we also present NOI on a cash basis, which is NOI after eliminating the effects of straight-lining of rent.  We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level.  Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets.  Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations.  Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income.  NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property's results of operations.  For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level.  In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level.  NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently.  We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements.  NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
January 27, 2004
BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC. ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER 2003 RESULTS
 
, a real estate investment trust, today reported results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2003.
BOSTON, MA, January 27, 2004
 Boston Properties, Inc. (NYSE: BXP)
 
Results for the quarter ended December 31, 2003
 
Funds from Operations (FFO) for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 were $106.9 million, or $1.09 per share basic and $1.05 per share diluted.  This compares to FFO for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 of $113.5 million, or $1.19 per share basic and $1.14 per share diluted before the application of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended.  The weighted average number of basic and diluted shares outstanding totaled 97,944,897 and 107,187,540, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 and 95,313,371 and 105,630,130, respectively, for the same quarter last year.
 
Diluted FFO for the fourth quarter 2002 included approximately $0.11 per share generated by One and Two Independence Square, The Candler Building, 875 Third Avenue and 2300 N Street properties, which were sold as part of our capital recycling program in connection with the acquisition of 399 Park Avenue in September 2002.  Diluted FFO for the fourth quarter of 2003 included approximately $0.05 per share of higher interest costs compared to the fourth quarter of 2002 primarily as a result of the interest on $1.475 billion of floating-rate debt being refinanced during 2003 with longer-term, unsecured fixed-rate debt at an average interest rate of approximately 5.95% and after taking into account the interest expense associated with the sold properties.  After eliminating the contribution to FFO from the sold properties and excluding the effects of the refinancing of our floating-rate debt, diluted FFO per share would have increased by 6.8% between the two periods.
Net income available to common shareholders per share (EPS) for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 was $0.62 basic and $0.61 on a diluted basis. This compares to EPS for the fourth quarter of 2002 of $2.73 basic and $2.70 on a diluted basis.  EPS for the fourth quarter of 2002 included $2.08, on a diluted basis, related to gains on sales of real estate and discontinued operations.  Excluding the impact of these items, diluted EPS was $0.62 for the quarter ended December 31, 2002.
 
Results for the year ended December 31, 2003
 
FFO for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $412.1 million, or $4.25 per share basic and $4.09 per share diluted before the application of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended and early surrender lease adjustment.  FFO for the year ended 2003 compares to FFO of $399.5 million, or $4.29 per share basic and $4.09 per share diluted for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), we calculate Funds from Operations, or "FFO," by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), including non-recurring items), for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial, improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing the comparative operating and financial performance of the Company because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.
 
Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO after specific supplemental adjustments, including net derivative losses and early surrender lease adjustment.  Although our FFO as adjusted clearly differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO, as well as that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance.  FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO as adjusted should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our consolidated financial statements.
