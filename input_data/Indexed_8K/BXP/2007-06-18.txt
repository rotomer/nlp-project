On June 18, 2007, the Board of Directors of Boston Properties, Inc. (the "Company") renewed its shareholder rights plan by adopting a new Shareholder Rights Agreement, dated as of June 18, 2007, between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement"). Computershare Trust Company, N.A. also serves as the Company's transfer agent. The Rights Agreement replaces the Company's existing shareholder rights plan (the "1997 Plan"), which expired on June 18, 2007, and became effective upon the expiration of the 1997 Plan. The following description of the terms of the Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights Agreement, which has been filed as to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Exhibit 4.1
Pursuant and subject to the terms of the Rights Agreement, the Board of Directors has declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock") to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 29, 2007 (the "Record Date"). In addition, one Right will automatically attach to each share of Common Stock issued between the Record Date and the Distribution Date (as hereinafter defined). Each Right entitles the registered holder thereof to purchase from the Company a unit consisting of one ten-thousandth of a share (a "Unit") of Series E Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Preferred Stock") at a cash exercise price of Three Hundred Fifty United States Dollar (U.S. $350) per Unit (the "Exercise Price"), subject to adjustment, under certain conditions specified in the Rights Agreement and summarized below.
Initially, the Rights are not exercisable and are attached to and trade with all shares of Common Stock outstanding as of, and issued subsequent to, the Record Date. The Rights will separate from the Common Stock and will become exercisable upon the earlier of (i) the close of business on the tenth (10
th
) calendar day following the first public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an "Acquiring Person") has acquired beneficial ownership after the effectiveness of the Rights Agreement, of more than 15% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and Excess Stock of the Company (together, "Common Shares"), other than as a result of repurchases of stock by the Company or certain inadvertent actions by a stockholder (the date of said announcement being referred to as the "Stock Acquisition Date"), or (ii) the close of business on the tenth (10
th
) business day (or such later day as the Board of Directors may determine) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that could result upon its consummation in a person or group becoming the beneficial owner after the effectiveness of the Rights Agreement, of more than 15% of the outstanding Common Shares (the earlier of such dates being herein referred to as the "Distribution Date"). As was also provided in the 1997 Plan, for these purposes, a person will not be deemed to beneficially own shares of Common Stock which may be issued in exchange for units of limited partnership interest ("OP Units") in Boston Properties Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership") until such person actually receives such shares of Common Stock. In addition, no person who was an original partner of the Operating Partnership will be an Acquiring Person unless such person acquires beneficial ownership of (i) more than 15% of the outstanding Common Shares and (ii) a greater percentage of the then outstanding Common Shares and OP Units (excluding OP Units held by the Company) than that percentage of the total number of shares of Common Stock and OP Units (excluding OP Units held by the Company) that such partner originally held.
In the event that a Stock Acquisition Date occurs, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right (other than an Acquiring Person or its associates or affiliates, whose Rights shall
become null and void) will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise, in lieu of a number of Units of Preferred Stock, that number of shares of Common Stock of the Company (or, in certain circumstances, including if there are insufficient shares of Common Stock to permit the exercise in full of the Rights, Units of Preferred Stock, other securities, cash or property, or any combination of the foregoing) having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right (such right being referred to as the "Subscription Right"). In the event that, at any time following the Stock Acquisition Date, (i) the Company consolidates with, or merges with and into, any other person, and the Company is not the continuing or surviving corporation, (ii) any person consolidates with the Company, or merges with and into the Company and the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation of such merger and, in connection with such merger, all or part of the shares of Common Stock are changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property, or (iii) 50% or more of the Company's assets or earning power is sold, mortgaged or otherwise transferred, each holder of a Right (other than an Acquiring Person or its associates or affiliates, whose Rights shall become null and void) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, common stock of the acquiring company having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right (such right being referred to as the "Merger Right"). The holder of a Right will continue to have the Merger Right whether or not such holder has exercised the Subscription Right. Rights that are or were beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person may (under certain circumstances specified in the Rights Agreement) become null and void.
The Rights may be redeemed in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.001 per Right (payable in cash, Common Stock or other consideration deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors) by the Board of Directors only until the earlier of (i) the time at which any person becomes an Acquiring Person, or (ii) the expiration date of the Rights Agreement. Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors ordering redemption of the Rights, the Rights will terminate and thereafter the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the redemption price.
The Rights Agreement may be amended by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion until the time at which any person becomes an Acquiring Person. After such time the Board of Directors may, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Rights Agreement, amend the Rights Agreement only to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to shorten or lengthen any time period, or to make changes that do not adversely affect the interests of Rights holders (excluding the interests of an Acquiring Person or its associates or affiliates). In addition, the Board of Directors may at any time prior to the time at which any person becomes an Acquiring Person, amend the Rights Agreement to lower the threshold at which a person becomes an Acquiring Person to not less than the greater of (i) the sum of .001% and the largest percentage of the outstanding Common Shares then owned by any person and (ii) 10%.
Until a Right is exercised, the holder will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company (beyond those as an existing stockholder), including the right to vote or to receive dividends. While the distribution of the Rights will not be taxable to stockholders or to the Company, stockholders may, depending upon the circumstances, recognize taxable income in the event that the Rights become exercisable for Units of Preferred Stock, other securities of the Company, other consideration or for common stock of an acquiring company.
The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date and will expire at the close of business on June 29, 2017 (the "Expiration Date"), unless previously redeemed or exchanged by the Company as described above.
The information included in Item 1.01 is incorporated by reference into this item. The Rights Agreement, specifying the terms of the Rights, has been filed as to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

On June 18, 2007, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Designations of Series E Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock with the Delaware Secretary of State, amending and restating the designations, rights and preferences of the Series E Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights (if the Rights become exercisable). This Amended and Restated Certificate of Designations has been filed as to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Exhibit 3.1
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

EXHIBIT 3.1
Section 1. . The shares of such series shall be designated as "Series E Junior Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock", par value $.01 per share (the "Series E Preferred Stock"), and the number of shares initially constituting such series shall be 150,000; , , that if more than a total of 150,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be issuable upon the exercise of Rights (the "Rights") issued pursuant to the Shareholder Rights Agreement dated as of June 18, 2007, between the Corporation and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement"), the Board of Directors of the Corporation, pursuant to Section 151(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, may direct by resolution or resolutions that a certificate be properly executed, acknowledged, filed and recorded, in accordance with the provisions of Section 103 thereof, providing for the total number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock authorized to be issued to be increased (to the extent that the Certificate of Incorporation then permits) to the largest number of whole shares (rounded up to the nearest whole number) issuable upon exercise of such Rights.
Designation and Amount
provided
however
Section 2. .
Dividends and Distributions
(A)   (i) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of preferred stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of shares of common stock and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series E Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 10,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 10,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of common stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of common stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the common stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series E Preferred Stock. The multiple of cash and non-cash dividends declared on the common stock to which holders of the Series E Preferred Stock are entitled, which shall be 10,000 initially but which shall be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided, is hereinafter referred to as the "Dividend Multiple." In the event the Corporation shall at any time after June 18, 2007 (the "Rights Declaration Date") (i) declare or pay any dividend on common stock payable in shares of common stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding
shares of common stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of common stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of common stock, then in each such case the Dividend Multiple thereafter applicable to the determination of the amount of dividends which holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive shall be the Dividend Multiple applicable immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(ii) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this paragraph (A), the Corporation shall, out of funds legally available for that purpose, declare a dividend or distribution on the Series E Preferred Stock as provided in this paragraph (A) immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the common stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of common stock); that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the common stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Series E Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
provided
(B) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series E Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series E Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix in accordance with applicable law a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than such number of days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof as may be allowed by applicable law.
Section 3. . In addition to any other voting rights required by law, the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights
(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series E Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 10,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. The number of votes which a holder of a share of Series E Preferred Stock is entitled to cast, which shall initially be 10,000 but which may be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided, is hereinafter referred to as the "Vote Multiple." In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare or pay any dividend on common stock payable in shares of common stock, or
(ii) effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of common stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of common stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of common stock, then in each such case the Vote Multiple thereafter applicable to the determination of the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be entitled shall be the Vote Multiple immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of common stock and the holders of shares of any other capital stock of this Corporation having general voting rights, shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
(C)   (i) Whenever, at any time or times, dividends payable on any shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon (whether or not declared and whether or not consecutive), the holders of record of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have the exclusive right, voting separately as a single class, to elect two directors of the Corporation at a special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation or at the Corporation's next annual meeting of stockholders, and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders, as provided below. At elections for such directors, each Series E Preferred Share shall entitle the holder thereof to 10,000 votes in such elections, subject to adjustment as set forth above.
(ii) Upon the vesting of such right of the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board of Directors shall automatically be increased by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock as hereinafter set forth. A special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation then entitled to vote shall be called by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the President or the Secretary of the Corporation, if requested in writing by the holders of record of not less than 10% of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock then outstanding. At such special meeting, or, if no such special meeting shall have been called, then at the next annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the holders of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall elect, voting as above provided, two directors of the Corporation to fill the aforesaid vacancies created by the automatic increase in the number of members of the Board of Directors. Any director elected by holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section may be removed at any annual or special meeting, by vote of the stockholders voting as a class who elected such director, with or without cause. In case any vacancy shall occur among the directors elected by the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section, such vacancy may be filled by the remaining director so elected, or his successor then in office, and the director so elected to fill such vacancy shall serve until the next meeting of stockholders for the election of directors. After the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of directors shall not be further increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or pari passu with the Series E Preferred Stock.
(iii) The right of the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, to elect two members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation as aforesaid shall continue until, and only until, such time as all dividends accumulated on such shares of Series E Preferred Stock for past dividend periods and the dividend for the then current dividend period shall have been paid, at which time such right shall terminate, except as herein or by law expressly provided subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above-mentioned. Upon any termination of the right of the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock as a class to vote for directors as herein provided, the term of office of all directors then in office elected by the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section shall terminate immediately. Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section shall terminate and the special voting powers vested in the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section shall have expired, the maximum number of members of this Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be such number as may be provided for in the By-laws of the Corporation, irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this Section.
(D) Except as otherwise required by applicable law or as set forth herein, holders of Series E Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of common stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
Section 4. .
Certain Restrictions
(A) Whenever dividends or distributions payable on the Series E Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series E Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
(i) declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series E Preferred Stock;
(ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series E Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series E Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
(iii) except as permitted in subsection 4(A)(iv) below, redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series E Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series E Preferred Stock; or
(iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series E Preferred Stock, or any shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series E Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
(B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under subsection (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
Section 5. . Any shares of Series E Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of preferred stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.
Reacquired Shares
Section 6. . Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (x) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series E Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have received an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, plus an amount equal to the greater of (1) $10,000.00 per share or (2) an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 10,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of common stock, or (y) to the holders of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series E Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series E Preferred Stock and all other such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare or pay any dividend on common stock payable in shares of common stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of common stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of common stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of common stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount per share to which holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (x) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up
Neither the consolidation of nor merging of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or corporations, nor the sale or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation within the meaning of this Section 6.
Section 7. In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of common stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 10,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of common stock is changed or exchanged, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, payable with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare or pay any dividend on common stock payable in shares of common stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of common stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of common stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of common stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Consolidation, Merger, etc.
Section 8. . The shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable; , , that the foregoing shall not limit the ability of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise deal in such shares to the extent otherwise permitted hereby and by law.
Redemption
provided
however

Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or a Certificate of Designations relating to any other series of preferred stock of the Corporation, the Series E Preferred Stock shall rank junior to every other series of the Corporation's preferred stock previously or hereafter authorized, as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets on liquidation, dissolution or winding up and shall rank senior to the common stock.
Ranking
Section 10. . The Certificate of Incorporation and this Amended and Restated Certificate of Designations shall not be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series E Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds or more of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.
Amendment
Section 11. . Series E Preferred Stock may be issued in whole shares or in any fraction of a share that is one ten-thousandth (1/10,000th) of a share or any integral multiple of such fraction, which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series E Preferred Stock. In lieu of fractional shares, the Corporation may elect to make a cash payment as provided in the Rights Agreement for fractions of a share other than one ten-thousandth (1/10,000th) of a share or any integral multiple thereof.
Fractional Shares

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:
Section 1. . For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings indicated:
Certain Definitions
(a) "" shall mean any Person (as such term is hereinafter defined) who or which, together with all Affiliates (as such term is hereinafter defined) and Associates (as such term is hereinafter defined) of such Person, shall be the Beneficial Owner (as such term is hereinafter defined) of more than 15% of the Common Shares (as such term is hereinafter defined) then outstanding, but shall not include (i) the Company, (ii) any Subsidiary (as such term is hereinafter defined) of the Company, (iii) any employee benefit plan or compensation arrangement of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or (iv) any Person holding shares of Common Stock of the Company organized, appointed or established by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for or pursuant to the terms of any such employee benefit plan or compensation arrangement (the Persons described in clauses (i) through (iv) above are referred to herein as "Exempt Persons"); , , that the term "Acquiring Person" shall not include any Grandfathered Person, unless such Grandfathered Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of a percentage of the shares of Common Stock of the Company then outstanding equal to or exceeding such Grandfathered Person's Grandfathered Percentage.
Acquiring Person
provided
however
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Person shall become an "Acquiring Person" as the result of an acquisition by the Company of Common Shares which, by reducing the number of Common Shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number of Common Shares Beneficially Owned by such Person to more than 15% (or in the case of a Grandfathered Person, the Grandfathered Percentage applicable to such Grandfathered Person) of the Common Shares then outstanding; , , that if a Person shall become the Beneficial Owner of more than 15% (or in the case of a Grandfathered Person, the Grandfathered Percentage applicable to such Grandfathered Person) of the Common Shares then outstanding by reason of share purchases by the Company and shall, after such share purchases by the Company, become the Beneficial Owner of any additional Common Shares (other than pursuant to a stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction) and immediately thereafter be the Beneficial Owner of more than 15% (or in the case of a Grandfathered Person, the Grandfathered Percentage applicable to such Grandfathered Person) of the Common Shares then outstanding, then such Person shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person."
provided
however
In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this Agreement including, without limitation, in Sections 1(qq), 3(a) or 27, a Person shall not be an "Acquiring Person" if the Board of Directors of the Company determines at any time that a Person who would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person," has become such without intending to become an "Acquiring Person," and such Person divests as promptly as practicable (or within such period of time as the Board of Directors of the Company determines is reasonable) a sufficient number of Common Shares so that such Person would no longer be an "Acquiring Person," as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 1(a).
 
Furthermore, in recognition that Original Partners who present their OP Units to the Operating Partnership for redemption may, if the Company in accordance with the Operating Partnership Agreement acquires such OP Units in exchange for shares of Common Stock of the Company, own in excess of 15% of the Common Shares, no Original Partner shall be an Acquiring Person unless such Original Partner Beneficially Owns both (i) more than 15% of the Common Shares then outstanding and (ii) a greater Economic Interest than such Original Partner's Original Economic Interest. The preceding two paragraphs shall apply, , to Original Partners after taking into account the preceding sentence.
mutatis mutandi

(c) Certificates for the Common Stock of the Company issued after the Record Date, but prior to the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Expiration Date, shall be deemed also to be certificates for Rights, and shall bear a legend, substantially in the form set forth below:
This certificate also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to certain Rights as set forth in a Shareholder Rights Agreement between Boston Properties, Inc. and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (or any successor thereto), as Rights Agent, dated as of June 18, 2007 as amended, restated, renewed, supplemented or extended from time to time (the "Rights Agreement"), the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is on file at the principal offices of Boston Properties, Inc. and the stock transfer administration office of the Rights Agent. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Rights Agreement, such Rights will be evidenced by separate certificates and will no longer be evidenced by this certificate. Boston Properties, Inc. may redeem the Rights at a redemption price of $0.001 per Right, subject to adjustment, under the terms of the Rights Agreement. Boston Properties, Inc. will mail to the holder of this certificate a copy of the Rights Agreement, as in effect on the date of mailing, without charge promptly after receipt of a written request therefor. Under certain circumstances, Rights issued to or held by Acquiring Persons or any Affiliates or Associates thereof (as defined in the Rights Agreement), and any subsequent holder of such Rights, may become null and void. The Rights shall not be exercisable, and shall be void so long as held, by a holder in any jurisdiction where the requisite qualification, if any, to the issuance to such holder, or the exercise by such holder, of the Rights in such jurisdiction shall not have been obtained or be obtainable.
With respect to such certificates containing the foregoing legend, the Rights associated with the Common Stock of the Company represented by such certificates shall be evidenced by such certificates alone until the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Expiration Date, and the transfer of any of such certificates shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock of the Company represented by such certificates. In the event that the Company purchases or acquires any shares of Common Stock of the Company after the Record Date but prior to the Distribution Date, any Rights associated with such Common Stock of the Company shall be deemed canceled and retired so that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise any Rights associated with the shares of Common Stock of the Company which are no longer outstanding. The failure to print the foregoing legend on any such certificate representing Common Stock of the Company or any defect therein shall not affect in any manner whatsoever the application or interpretation of the provisions of Section 7(e) hereof.
 
(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that prior to the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Expiration Date, any shares of Common Stock are retired and canceled in connection with the conversion of such shares to Excess Stock pursuant to Article IV(D) of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, then the associated Rights shall be deemed to be similarly retired and canceled.

such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement). This Right Certificate and the Rights represented hereby may become null and void under certain circumstances as specified in Section 7(e) of the Rights Agreement.
The Company shall give notice to the Rights Agent promptly after it becomes aware of the existence and identity of any Acquiring Person or any Associate or Affiliate thereof. The Company shall instruct the Rights Agent in writing of the Rights which should be so legended.

(d) In case the registered holder of any Right Certificate shall exercise less than all the Rights evidenced thereby, a new Right Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent to the Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued by the Rights Agent and delivered to the registered holder of such Right Certificate or to his duly authorized assigns, subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof.

The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provisions of this Section 7(e) and Section 4(b) hereof are complied with, but shall have no liability to any holder of Right Certificates or other Person as a result of its failure to make any determinations with respect to an Acquiring Person or any Affiliates or Associates of an Acquiring Person or any transferee of any of them hereunder.
(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the Company shall be obligated to undertake any action with respect to a registered holder of Rights upon the occurrence of any purported exercise as set forth in this Section 7 unless such registered holder shall have (i) completed and signed the certificate contained in the form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse side of the Right Certificate surrendered for such exercise, and (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates thereof as the Company shall reasonably request.
Section 8. .

The Company shall deliver to the Rights Agent for cancellation and retirement, and the Rights Agent shall so cancel and retire, any other Right Certificate purchased or acquired by the Company otherwise than upon the exercise thereof. The Rights Agent shall deliver all canceled Right Certificates to the Company.

Section 9. .
Reservation and Availability of Preferred Stock
(a) The Company covenants and agrees that it will cause to be reserved and kept available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock or any authorized and
 
issued shares of Preferred Stock held in its treasury, the number of shares of Preferred Stock that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding and exercisable Rights. Upon the occurrence of any events resulting in an increase in the aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of all outstanding Rights in excess of the number then reserved, the Company shall make appropriate increases in the number of shares so reserved.
(b) The Company shall use its best efforts to cause, from and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, all shares of Preferred Stock issued or reserved for issuance to be listed, upon official notice of issuance, upon the principal national securities exchange, if any, upon which the Common Stock of the Company is listed or, if the principal market for the Common Stock of the Company is not on any national securities exchange, to be eligible for quotation on any other comparable quotation system.
(c) The Company shall use its best efforts to (i) file, as soon as practicable following the earliest date after the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event on which the consideration to be delivered by the Company upon exercise of the Rights has been determined in accordance with Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, or as soon as required by law following the Distribution Date, as the case may be, a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, (ii) cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing and (iii) cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus that at all times meets the requirements of the Securities Act) until the earlier of (A) the date as of which the Rights are no longer exercisable for such securities or (B) the Expiration Date. The Company will also take such action as may be appropriate under, and which will ensure compliance with, the securities or "blue sky" laws of the various states in connection with the exercisability of the Rights. The Company may temporarily suspend, for a period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days after the date determined in accordance with the provisions of the first sentence of this Section 9(c), the exercisability of the Rights in order to prepare and file such registration statement and permit it to become effective. Upon such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect, in each case with prompt written notice to the Rights Agent. Notwithstanding any such provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable in any jurisdiction unless the requisite qualification in such jurisdiction shall have been obtained.
(d) The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares of Preferred Stock delivered upon the exercise of the Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates or depositary receipts for such shares (subject to payment of the Exercise Price), be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and nonassessable.
(e) The Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when due and payable any and all federal and state transfer taxes and charges which may be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or of any certificates for shares of Preferred Stock and/or other property upon the exercise of Rights. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any transfer tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer or delivery of
 
Right Certificates or the issuance or delivery of other securities or property to a person other than, or in respect of the issuance or delivery of securities or other property in a name other than that of, the registered holder of the Right Certificates evidencing Rights surrendered for exercise or to issue or deliver any certificates for securities or other property in a name other than that of the registered holder upon the exercise of any Rights until such tax shall have been paid (any such tax being payable by the holder of such Right Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it has been established to the Company's satisfaction that no such tax is due.
Section 10. . Each Person in whose name any certificate for Preferred Stock or other securities (including any fraction of a share of Preferred Stock or such other securities) is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares of Preferred Stock or such other securities represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Exercise Price (and any applicable transfer taxes) was made; , , that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the transfer books of the Company for the Preferred Stock or such other securities, as applicable, are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares of Preferred Stock or such other securities on, and such certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the transfer books of the Company are open; and further , , that if delivery of shares of Preferred Stock or such other securities is delayed pursuant to Section 9(c), such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares of Preferred Stock or such other securities only when such shares or such other securities first become deliverable. Prior to the exercise of the Right evidenced thereby, the holder of a Right Certificate shall not be entitled to any rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to shares for which the Rights shall be exercisable, including, without limitation, the right to vote, to receive dividends or other distributions or to exercise any preemptive rights, and shall not be entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of the Company, except as provided herein.

Adjustment of Exercise Price, Number and Kind of Shares or Number of Rights
(a)        (i) In the event the Company shall at any time after the date of this Agreement (A) declare a dividend on the Preferred Stock payable in shares of Preferred Stock, (B) subdivide the outstanding Preferred Stock, (C) combine the outstanding Preferred Stock into a smaller number of shares or (D) issue, change or alter any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification or recapitalization of the Preferred Stock (including any such reclassification or recapitalization in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving Person), except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a) and Section 7(e) hereof, the Exercise Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or the effective time of such subdivision, combination, reclassification or recapitalization, and the number and kind of shares of capital stock issuable on such date or at such time, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any Right exercised after such time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock which, if such Right had
 
been exercised immediately prior to such date and at a time when the Preferred Stock transfer books of the Company were open, such holder would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision, combination, reclassification or recapitalization; , , that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of a Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of a Right. If an event occurs which would require an adjustment under both Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, the adjustment provided for in this Section 11(a)(i) shall be in addition to, and shall be made prior to, any adjustment required pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof.

            (ii) Subject to the provisions of Section 24 hereof, in the event any Person, alone or together with its Affiliates and Associates, shall become an Acquiring Person, then, promptly following any such occurrence (a "Section 11(a)(ii) Event"), proper provision shall be made so that each holder of a Right, except as provided in Section 7(e) hereof, shall thereafter have a right to receive, upon exercise thereof at the then current Exercise Price in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in lieu of a number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock of the Company as shall equal the result obtained by (x) multiplying the then current Exercise Price by the then number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to the first occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, whether or not such Right was then exercisable, and dividing that product by (y) 50% of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock of the Company (determined pursuant to Section 11(d)) on the date of the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event (such number of shares being referred to as the "Adjustment Shares").
            (iii) In lieu of issuing any shares of Common Stock of the Company in accordance with Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, the Company, acting by or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, may, and in the event that the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company which are authorized by the Company's Certificate of Incorporation but not outstanding or reserved for issuance for purposes other than upon exercise of the Rights is not sufficient to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii) of this Section 11(a), the Company, acting by or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company, shall: (A) determine the excess of (X) the Fair Market Value of the Adjustment Shares issuable upon the exercise of a Right (the "Current Value") over (Y) the Exercise Price attributable to each Right (such excess being referred to as the "Spread") and (B) with respect to all or a portion of each Right (subject to Section 7(e) hereof), make adequate provision to substitute for the Adjustment Shares, upon payment of the applicable Exercise Price, (1) Common Stock of the Company or equity securities, if any, of the Company other than Common Stock of the Company (including, without limitation, shares, or units of shares, of Preferred Stock that the Board of Directors of the Company has determined to have the same value as shares of Common Stock of the Company (such shares of Preferred Stock being referred to herein as "Common Stock Equivalents")), (2) cash, (3) a reduction in the Exercise Price, (4) Preferred Stock Equivalents which the Board of Directors of the Company has deemed to have the same
 
value as shares of Common Stock of the Company, (5) debt securities of the Company, (6) other assets or securities of the Company or (7) any combination of the foregoing, having an aggregate value equal to the Current Value, where such aggregate value has been determined by the Board of Directors of the Company after receiving the advice of a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Board of Directors of the Company; , , that if the Company shall not have made adequate provision to deliver value pursuant to clause (B) above within thirty (30) days following the later of (x) the first occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event and (y) the date on which the Company's right of redemption pursuant to Section 23(a) expires (the later of (x) and (y) being referred to herein as the "Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date"), then the Company shall be obligated to deliver, upon the surrender for exercise of a Right and without requiring payment of the Exercise Price, shares of Common Stock of the Company (to the extent available) and then, if necessary, cash, which shares and/or cash have an aggregate value equal to the Spread. If the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine in good faith that it is likely that sufficient additional shares of Common Stock of the Company could be authorized for issuance upon exercise in full of the Rights, the 30-day period set forth above may be extended to the extent necessary, but not more than ninety (90) days after the Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date, in order that the Company may seek stockholder approval for the authorization of such additional shares (such period, as it may be extended, being referred to herein as the "Substitution Period"). To the extent that the Company determines that some action need be taken pursuant to the first and/or second sentences of this Section 11(a)(iii), the Company (x) shall provide, subject to Section 7(e) hereof, that such action shall apply uniformly to all outstanding Rights and (y) may suspend the exercisability of the Rights until the expiration of the Substitution Period in order to seek any authorization of additional shares and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to such first sentence and to determine the value thereof. In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended and a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect. For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii), the value of the Common Stock of the Company and of the Preferred Stock shall be the Fair Market Value (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) per share of the Common Stock of the Company and the Preferred Stock, respectively, on the Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date, the value of any Common Stock Equivalent shall be deemed to have the same value as the Common Stock of the Company on such date and the value of any Preferred Stock Equivalent shall be deemed to have the same value as the Preferred Stock on such date.

(b) If the Company shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all holders of Preferred Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within forty-five (45) calendar days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Stock (or securities having the same or more favorable rights, privileges and preferences as the shares of Preferred Stock ("Preferred Stock Equivalents")) or securities convertible into Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock Equivalents at a price per share of Preferred Stock or per share of Preferred Stock Equivalents (or having a conversion price per share, if a security convertible into Preferred Stock or Preferred Stock Equivalents) less than the Fair Market Value (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) per share of Preferred Stock on such record date, the Exercise Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect
 
immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding on such record date, plus the number of shares of Preferred Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock and/or Preferred Stock Equivalents to be offered (and the aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible securities so to be offered) would purchase at such Fair Market Value and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding on such record date, plus the number of additional shares of Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock Equivalents to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so to be offered are initially convertible); , , that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of a Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of a Right. In case such subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be the Fair Market Value thereof determined in accordance with Section 11(d) hereof. Shares of Preferred Stock owned by or held for the account of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted to be the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.

(c) If the Company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of Preferred Stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation), of evidences of indebtedness, cash (other than a regular periodic cash dividend out of the earnings or retained earnings of the Company), assets (other than a dividend payable in Preferred Stock, but including any dividend payable in stock other than Preferred Stock) or convertible securities, subscription rights or warrants (excluding those referred to in Section 11(b)), the Exercise Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Fair Market Value (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) per one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock on such record date, less the Fair Market Value (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) of the portion of the cash, assets or evidences of indebtedness so to be distributed or of such convertible securities, subscription rights or warrants applicable to one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock and the denominator of which shall be the Fair Market Value (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) per one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock; , , that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of a Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of a Right.

(d) For the purpose of this Agreement, the "Fair Market Value" of any share of Preferred Stock, Common Stock or any other stock or any Right or other security or any other property shall be determined as provided in this Section 11(d).

per share of such stock or per unit of such other security for the 30 consecutive Trading Days (as such term is hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date; , , that in the event that the Fair Market Value per share of any share of stock is determined during a period following the announcement by the issuer of such stock of (x) a dividend or distribution on such stock payable in shares of such stock or securities convertible into shares of such stock or (y) any subdivision, combination or reclassification of such stock, and prior to the expiration of the 30 Trading Day period after the ex-dividend date for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification, then, and in each such case, the Fair Market Value shall be properly adjusted to take into account ex-dividend trading. The closing price for each day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the securities are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which such security is listed or admitted to trading; or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price (or, if not so quoted, the average of the last quoted high bid and low asked prices) in the over-the-counter market, as reported by such system then in use; or, if on any such date no bids for such security are quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in such security selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. If on any such date no market maker is making a market in such security, the Fair Market Value of such security on such date shall be determined reasonably and with utmost good faith to the holders of the Rights by the Board of Directors of the Company, , , that if at the time of such determination there is an Acquiring Person, the Fair Market Value of such security on such date shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Board of Directors of the Company, which determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be binding on the Rights Agent and the holders of the Rights. The term "Trading Day" shall mean a day on which the principal national securities exchange on which such security is listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business or, if such security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, a Business Day.

(iii) In the case of property other than securities, the Fair Market Value thereof shall be determined reasonably and in good faith to the holders of Rights by the Board of Directors of the Company; , , that if at the time of such determination there is an Acquiring Person, the Fair Market Value of such property on such date shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Board of Directors of the Company, which determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be binding upon the Rights Agent and the holders of the Rights.

(e) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no adjustment in the Exercise Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Exercise Price; , , that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 11(e) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-millionth of a share of Common Stock of the Company or hundred-millionth of a share of Preferred Stock, as the case may be, or to such other figure as the Board of Directors of the Company may deem appropriate. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 11(e), any adjustment required by this Section 11 shall be made no later than the earlier of (i) three (3) years from the date of the transaction which mandates such adjustment or (ii) the Expiration Date.

(g) All Rights originally issued by the Company subsequent to any adjustment made to the Exercise Price hereunder shall evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Exercise Price, the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock (or other securities or amount of cash or combination thereof) purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the Rights, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.
(h) Unless the Company shall have exercised its election as provided in Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the Exercise Price as a result of the calculations made in Section 11(b) and (c), each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Exercise Price, that number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock (calculated to the nearest hundred-
 
millionth) as the Board of Directors of the Company determines is appropriate to preserve the economic value of the Rights, including, by way of example, that number obtained by (i) multiplying (x) the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right may be exercisable immediately prior to this adjustment by (y) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the Exercise Price and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Exercise Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Exercise Price.
(i) The Company may elect on or after the date of any adjustment of the Exercise Price to adjust the number of Rights, in substitution for any adjustment in the number of shares of Preferred Stock purchasable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after the adjustment in the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest one-millionth) obtained by dividing the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Exercise Price by the Exercise Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Exercise Price. The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. This record date may be the date on which the Exercise Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, shall be at least ten (10) days later than the date of the public announcement. If Right Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(i), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right Certificates on such record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject to Section 14 hereof, the additional Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Right Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled after such adjustment. Right Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein (and may bear, at the option of the Company, the adjusted Exercise Price) and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.
(j) Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Exercise Price or the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Exercise Price per share and the number of shares which were expressed in the initial Right Certificates issued hereunder without prejudice to any adjustment or change.
(k) Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Exercise Price below the then stated value, if any, of the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Preferred Stock at such adjusted Exercise Price.
 
(l) In any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the Exercise Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event the issuing to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock or other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the number of one ten-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Exercise Price in effect prior to such adjustment; , , that the Company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.

(m) Anything in this Section 11 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall be entitled to make such reductions in the Exercise Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to the extent that in its good faith judgment the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine to be advisable in order that any consolidation or subdivision of the Preferred Stock, issuance wholly for cash of any shares of Preferred Stock at less than the Fair Market Value, issuance wholly for cash of shares of Preferred Stock or securities which by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Preferred Stock, stock dividends or issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to hereinabove in this Section 11, hereafter made by the Company to holders of its Preferred Stock, shall not be taxable to such stockholders.
(n) The Company covenants and agrees that it shall not, at any time after the Distribution Date and so long as the Rights have not been redeemed pursuant to Section 23 hereof or exchanged pursuant to Section 24 hereof, (i) consolidate with (other than a Subsidiary of the Company in a transaction that complies with the proviso at the end of this sentence), (ii) merge with or into, or (iii) sell or transfer (or permit any Subsidiary to sell or transfer), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, assets or earning power aggregating 50% or more of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, to any other Person or Persons (other than the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries in one or more transactions each of which complies with the proviso at the end of this sentence) if (x) at the time of or immediately after such consolidation, merger or sale there are any rights, warrants or other instruments outstanding or agreements or arrangements in effect which would substantially diminish or otherwise eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights, or (y) prior to, simultaneously with or immediately after such consolidation, merger or sale the shareholders of a Person who constitutes, or would constitute, the "Principal Party" for the purposes of Section 13(a) hereof shall have received a distribution of Rights previously owned by such Person or any of its Affiliates and Associates; , , that, subject to the following sentence, this Section 11(n) shall not affect the ability of any Subsidiary of the Company to consolidate with, or merge with or into, or sell or transfer assets or earning power to, any other Subsidiary of the Company. The Company further covenants and agrees that after the Distribution Date it will not, except as permitted by Section 23 or Section 27 hereof, take (or permit any Subsidiary to take) any action if at the time such action is taken it is reasonably foreseeable that such action will substantially diminish or otherwise eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights.

Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity.
(i) The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or through its attorneys or agents.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time
 
after any Person (other than an Exempt Person), together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of 50% or more of the Common Stock of the Company.
            (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time on or after the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, exchange all or part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(e) hereof) for shares of Common Stock of the Company at an exchange ratio specified in the following sentence, as appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date of this Agreement. Subject to the adjustment described in the foregoing sentence, each Right may be exchanged for that number of shares of Common Stock of the Company obtained by dividing the Spread (as defined in Section 11(a)(iii)) by the then Fair Market Value per one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock on the earlier of (x) the date on which any person becomes an Acquiring Person or (y) the date on which a tender or exchange offer by any Person (other than an Exempt Person) is first published or sent or given within the meaning of Rule 14d-4(a) of the Exchange Act or any successor rule, if upon consummation thereof such Person could become an Acquiring Person (such exchange ratio being referred to herein as the "Section 24(a)(ii) Exchange Ratio"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any Person (other than an Exempt Person), together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of 50% or more of the Common Stock of the Company.
(b) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of shares of Common Stock of the Company equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Section 24(a)(i) Exchange Ratio or the Section 24(a)(ii) Exchange Ratio, as applicable; , , that the holder of a Right exchanged pursuant to this Section 24 shall continue to have the right to purchase securities or other property of the Principal Party following a Section 13 Event that has occurred or may thereafter occur. The Company shall promptly give notice of any such exchange in accordance with Section 26 hereof and shall promptly mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of such Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent; , , that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the shares of Common Stock of the Company for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of Section 7(e) hereof) held by each holder of Rights.

(c) In any exchange pursuant to this Section 24, the Company, at its option, may substitute Preferred Stock (or Preferred Stock Equivalent, as such term is defined in Section 11(b) hereof) for Common Stock of the Company exchangeable for Rights, at the initial rate of one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock (or Preferred Stock Equivalent) for each share of Common Stock of the Company, as appropriately adjusted to reflect adjustments in the voting rights of the Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms thereof, so that the fraction of a share of Preferred Stock delivered in lieu of each share of Common Stock of the Company shall have the same voting rights as one share of Common Stock of the Company.
(d) In the event that there shall not be sufficient shares of Common Stock of the Company or Preferred Stock (or Preferred Stock Equivalents) issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit any exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with this Section 24, the Company shall take all such action as may be necessary to authorize additional shares of Common Stock of the Company or Preferred Stock (or Preferred Stock Equivalent) for issuance upon exchange of the Rights.
(e) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Common Stock of the Company or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares of Common Stock of the Company. If the Company elects not to issue such fractional shares of Common Stock of the Company, the Company shall pay, in lieu of such fractional shares of Common Stock of the Company, to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional shares of Common Stock of the Company would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the Fair Market Value of a whole share of Common Stock of the Company. For the purposes of this paragraph (e), the Fair Market Value of a whole share of Common Stock of the Company shall be the closing price of a share of Common Stock of the Company (as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 11(d)(i) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of exchange pursuant to this Section 24.

Dividends and Distributions
(A)        (i) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of preferred stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of shares of common stock and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series E Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 10,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 10,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of common stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of common stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the common stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series E Preferred Stock. The multiple of cash and non-cash dividends declared on the common stock to which holders of the Series E Preferred Stock are entitled, which shall be 10,000 initially but which shall be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided, is hereinafter referred to as the "Dividend Multiple." In the event the Corporation shall at any time after June 18, 2007 (the
 
"Rights Declaration Date") (i) declare or pay any dividend on common stock payable in shares of common stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of common stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of common stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of common stock, then in each such case the Dividend Multiple thereafter applicable to the determination of the amount of dividends which holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive shall be the Dividend Multiple applicable immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(ii) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this paragraph (A), the Corporation shall, out of funds legally available for that purpose, declare a dividend or distribution on the Series E Preferred Stock as provided in this paragraph (A) immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the common stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of common stock); that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the common stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Series E Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
provided
(B) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series E Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series E Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix in accordance with applicable law a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than such number of days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof as may be allowed by applicable law.
Section 3. . In addition to any other voting rights required by law, the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights
(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series E Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 10,000 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. The number of votes which a holder of a share of Series E Preferred Stock is entitled to cast, which shall initially be 10,000 but which may be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter provided, is hereinafter referred to as the "Vote
 
Multiple." In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare or pay any dividend on common stock payable in shares of common stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of common stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of common stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of common stock, then in each such case the Vote Multiple thereafter applicable to the determination of the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be entitled shall be the Vote Multiple immediately prior to such event multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B) Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of common stock and the holders of shares of any other capital stock of this Corporation having general voting rights, shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
(C)   (i) Whenever, at any time or times, dividends payable on any shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends thereon (whether or not declared and whether or not consecutive), the holders of record of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have the exclusive right, voting separately as a single class, to elect two directors of the Corporation at a special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation or at the Corporation's next annual meeting of stockholders, and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders, as provided below. At elections for such directors, each Series E Preferred Share shall entitle the holder thereof to 10,000 votes in such elections, subject to adjustment as set forth above.
(ii) Upon the vesting of such right of the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, the maximum authorized number of members of the Board of Directors shall automatically be increased by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock as hereinafter set forth. A special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation then entitled to vote shall be called by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the President or the Secretary of the Corporation, if requested in writing by the holders of record of not less than 10% of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock then outstanding. At such special meeting, or, if no such special meeting shall have been called, then at the next annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the holders of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall elect, voting as above provided, two directors of the Corporation to fill the aforesaid vacancies created by the automatic increase in the number of members of the Board of Directors. Any director elected by holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section may be removed at any annual or special meeting, by vote of the stockholders voting as a class who elected such director, with or without cause. In case any vacancy shall occur among the directors elected by the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section, such vacancy may be filled by the remaining director so elected, or his successor then in office, and the director so elected to fill such vacancy shall serve until the next meeting of stockholders for the election of directors. After the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect
 
directors in any default period and during the continuance of such period, the number of directors shall not be further increased or decreased except by vote of the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to or pari passu with the Series E Preferred Stock.
(iii) The right of the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, to elect two members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation as aforesaid shall continue until, and only until, such time as all dividends accumulated on such shares of Series E Preferred Stock for past dividend periods and the dividend for the then current dividend period shall have been paid, at which time such right shall terminate, except as herein or by law expressly provided subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the character above-mentioned. Upon any termination of the right of the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock as a class to vote for directors as herein provided, the term of office of all directors then in office elected by the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section shall terminate immediately. Whenever the term of office of the directors elected by the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section shall terminate and the special voting powers vested in the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section shall have expired, the maximum number of members of this Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be such number as may be provided for in the By-laws of the Corporation, irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of this Section.
(D) Except as otherwise required by applicable law or as set forth herein, holders of Series E Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of common stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
Section 4. .
Certain Restrictions
(A) Whenever dividends or distributions payable on the Series E Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series E Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
(i) declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series E Preferred Stock;
(ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series E Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series E Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
(iii) except as permitted in subsection 4(A)(iv) below, redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series E Preferred Stock, provided that
 
the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series E Preferred Stock; or
(iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series E Preferred Stock, or any shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series E Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
(B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under subsection (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
Section 5. . Any shares of Series E Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of preferred stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.
Reacquired Shares
Section 6. . Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise), dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (x) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series E Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have received an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, plus an amount equal to the greater of (1) $10,000.00 per share or (2) an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 10,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of common stock, or (y) to the holders of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series E Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series E Preferred Stock and all other such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare or pay any dividend on common stock payable in shares of common stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of common stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of common stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of common stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount per share to which holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (x) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up

Section 7. In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of common stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 10,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of common stock is changed or exchanged, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, payable with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare or pay any dividend on common stock payable in shares of common stock, or (ii) effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of common stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of common stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of common stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
