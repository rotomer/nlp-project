Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 23, 2008, Boston Properties Limited Partnership (the "Company"), a Delaware limited partnership and the entity through which Boston Properties, Inc. conducts substantially all of its business, entered into agreements with entities affiliated with Macklowe Properties to acquire the General Motors Building and a portfolio of other assets located in New York City consisting of 540 Madison Avenue, 125 West 55
th
Street and Two Grand Central Tower for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.949 billion. The purchase price consists of approximately $1.4655 billion of cash, the issuance to one of the selling entities of $10 million of common units of limited partnership interest in the Company and the assumption of approximately $2.4735 billion of fixed rate debt.
The aggregate purchase price was allocated as follows: General Motors Building, $2.8 billion; 540 Madison Avenue, $277.1 million; 125 West 55
th
Street, $444.0 million; and Two Grand Central Tower, $427.9 million. The debt that is expected to be assumed as part of the transactions consists of the following:
General Motors Building
 
540 Madison Avenue
 
125 West 55
th
Street
 
Two Grand Central Tower
 
The Company entered into the acquisition agreements through wholly-owned limited liability companies, but expects to admit one or more new members to those entities and consummate the acquisitions through joint ventures. The identity of the Company's joint venture partners and the specific terms and conditions of the joint venture arrangements have not been finalized, but the Company expects that it will ultimately own an economic interest of up to approximately 49% in the ventures and provide customary property management and leasing services.
The closing of the acquisitions is expected to occur in multiple steps, with the acquisition of the General Motors Building expected to close in June 2008 and the acquisition of the remaining assets occurring individually thereafter. The Company has posted a deposit in the form of four separate letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $165 million, of which $110 million relates to the General Motors Building and the balance is allocated among the remaining assets. Upon the closing of the General Motors Building, the Company will be required to increase the deposit on the remaining assets by an aggregate of $20 million, to be released when the last closing occurs.
The closing of the acquisitions is subject to customary conditions and termination rights for transactions of this type. The Company has completed its due diligence, secured the necessary lender approvals to assume the debt on the General Motors Building and is obligated to pursue the lender approvals for the assumption
 
of the debt on the other properties. The closing conditions also include the execution of a tax protection agreement that restricts the Company's (and any such joint venture's) ability to sell the General Motors Building and requires the Company (and any such joint venture) to maintain certain amounts of indebtedness associated with the property and its acquisition for a period of up to nine years. There can be no assurance that the closings will occur on the terms currently contemplated or at all.
The General Motors Building is an approximately 2,000,000 rentable square foot office building located at the corner of 5
th
Avenue and Central Park South in New York City. 540 Madison Avenue is a 39-story building located at Madison Avenue at 55
th
Street that contains approximately 292,000 rentable square feet. 125 West 55
th
Street is a 23-story building, spanning from 55
th
to 56
th
Streets between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, that contains approximately 591,000 rentable square feet. Two Grand Central Tower is a 44-story mid-block tower that runs from 44
th
to 45
th
Street between Lexington and Third Avenue and contains approximately 664,000 rentable square feet.

contained in this Agreement, Investor shall have no right to terminate this Agreement and there shall be no reduction in the Investor Contribution or the Macklowe Distribution if Owner, in the Owner Update Certificate (as hereinafter defined), makes any Permitted Updates. As used herein, the term "" shall mean a qualification to the Representations made by Owner in that (i) (x) either (A) derives from events that occur from and after the date hereof and are outside of the reasonable control of Owner or any person that directly or indirectly controls Owner or (B) derives from an act taken by Owner, or an omission made by Owner, in either case that is permitted to be taken or made by Owner hereunder, and (y) does not derive from a default of Owner hereunder, or (ii) is a qualification to the Representation made by Owner in the last sentence of or in hereof. If Owner, in the Owner Update Certificate, makes any qualifications to Owner's Representations that are not Permitted Updates (any such qualification that is not a Permitted Update being referred to herein as a ""), neither Investor nor the Company shall have any right, remedy or claim against Owner, unless the sum of (w) in the case of Qualifications resulting from circumstances that can be cured by the payment of money, the aggregate cost of correcting all such circumstances, plus (x) in the case of Qualifications resulting from circumstances that cannot readily be corrected with the payment of money, the aggregate diminution in the value of the Premises, exceeds the Threshold Amount, it being agreed that any uncured circumstances involving net costs and/or impairments to value that, when taken together with all prior such costs and impairments to value (after giving credit for any credits or cash payments made by Owner to offset the effect of those costs and impairments to value), in the aggregate, do not exceed the Threshold Amount shall be deemed immaterial, and neither Investor nor the Company shall have any remedy therefor (subject, however, to ). In the event any such uncured circumstances involve net costs and/or impairments to value that, when taken together with all prior such costs and impairments to value identified by Owner (after giving credit for any credits or cash payments made by the Owner set forth above), are in excess of the Threshold Amount, the rights of Investor shall be governed by and hereof.

Failure of Condition
Section 10(f)(i) and (ii)
Section 20(a)
 
forth in (unless Investor is otherwise willing to waive such conditions), then (i) Owner may, from time to time, if it so elects and without any abatement in the Investor Contribution or the Macklowe Distribution, adjourn the Scheduled Closing Date for a period or periods that, when aggregated with the number of days which Owner has previously adjourned the Closing in accordance with this Agreement, including, without limitation, hereof (but excluding , it being agreed that any extension by Owner under shall be in addition to any extension(s) under this ), does not exceed ninety (90) days in the aggregate, and (ii) if Owner does not so elect to adjourn the Scheduled Closing Date, Investor shall have the right to adjourn the Scheduled Closing Date from time to time for a period or periods that, when aggregated with the number of days which Investor has previously adjourned the Scheduled Closing Date in accordance with this Agreement, does not exceed thirty (30) days in the aggregate, by written notice thereof to Owner within five (5) business days after the Scheduled Closing Date, time being of the essence. If Investor elects to adjourn the Scheduled Closing Date as provided in  above, then (A) Owner, in good faith, shall seek to satisfy the conditions to Investor's obligation to proceed with the Closing (it being agreed that Owner shall have no obligation to expend any funds, commence any litigation or otherwise incur any liability in order to satisfy any such conditions), and (B) Investor and Boston Properties Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (""), shall be obligated, on a joint and several basis, to pay to Owner a per diem amount equal to $350,000.00 on a current monthly basis on the 1st day of each calendar month, in arrears, from and after the Scheduled Closing Date (prior to any such adjournment) until the earliest to occur of (I) the Closing, (II) the termination of this Agreement and (III) the last day of the adjournment period to which Investor adjourned the Scheduled Closing Date (which amounts shall be due and payable whether or not the Closing occurs, and which amounts shall be non-refundable and Owner shall have no liability to Investor or the Company therefor whatsoever). BPLP is countersigning this Agreement to indicate its agreement to be bound by and liable under this for such per diem amount. If, after any such extension, the conditions precedent to Investor's obligation to effect the Closing continue not to be satisfied (and Investor has not waived the same) or neither Owner nor Investor elects such extension and, in either case, such failure of condition precedent is not the result of Owner's default hereunder (it being agreed that, without limitation, the inability to deliver the Required Tenant Estoppel Certificates is not a default unless such inability derives from Owner's failure to request the Required Tenant Estoppel Certificate as required by hereof), then Investor shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement by notice given to Owner, and upon the timely giving of any such termination notice, Investor shall be entitled to a return of the Deposit and this Agreement shall terminate and neither party hereto shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder other than those which are expressly provided to survive the termination hereof. If the provisions of the preceding sentence would be applicable, except that such failure of condition precedent is the result of Owner's default hereunder, then shall govern. The provisions of this shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if interim payments are required to be made on account of such costs prior to the determination by the Arbiter, such interim payments shall be funded equally by Owner and Investor, subject to reimbursement of the prevailing party by the losing party upon the Arbiter's final determination hereunder.

Within ten (10) days after selection of an Arbiter, each party shall deliver to the Arbiter all instruments, documents and other materials forming the basis for the existence or non-existence of a Breach or the calculation of the Claimed Damage or Seller's Claimed Damage, as applicable. Within twenty (20) days of receipt of the submission of such instruments, documents and other instruments from both Seller and Purchaser, the Arbiter shall determine whether (A) a Breach has occurred, (B) if so, whether the same constitutes a Material Breach and (C) if a Material Breach has occurred, which of the Claimed Damage or Seller's Claimed Damage most closely reflects the actual diminution, if any, in the value of the Property resulting from the Material Breach found to exist.

The determination of the Arbiter hereunder shall be final and binding in all respects against all parties to this Agreement. Purchaser shall in no event be entitled to a credit or any other recourse against Seller for any sum in excess of the Escrow Funds with respect to any Material Breach. The costs and expenses of arbitration hereunder (including the fees and disbursements of the Arbiter) shall be paid by the party whose calculation of diminution in value of the Property resulting from the subject Breach shall not have been selected (i.e., if the Arbiter finds in favor of Seller's Claimed Damage, Purchaser shall pay the arbitration costs and if the Arbiter finds in favor of the
