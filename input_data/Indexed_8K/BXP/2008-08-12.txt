To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Boston Properties, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying statement of revenue over certain operating expenses (the "Statement") of the General Motors Building located at the corner of 5th Avenue and Central Park South in New York City, New York (the "Property") for the year ended December 31, 2007. This Statement is the responsibility of the Property's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this Statement based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Statement. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Statement. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
The accompanying Statement was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (for inclusion in the current report on Form 8-K/A of Boston Properties, Inc. dated June 6, 2008) as described in Note 2 and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the Property's revenue and expenses.
In our opinion, the Statement referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the revenue over certain operating expenses (as described in Note 2), of the Property for the year ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses (the "Statement") includes the operations of the General Motors Building, an approximately 2.0 million square foot Class A office tower (the "Property") located at the corner of 5th Avenue and Central Park South in New York City, New York. On June 9, 2008, the Property was acquired from affiliates of Macklowe Properties ("Macklowe") for a purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion through a joint venture among Boston Properties, Inc. (the "Company"), through its subsidiary Boston Properties Limited Partnership, US Real Estate Opportunities I, L.P., which is a partnership managed by Goldman Sachs, and Meraas Capital LLC, a Dubai-based private equity firm. The Company has a 60% interest in the venture and provides customary property management and leasing services for the venture. The purchase price consisted of approximately $890.0 million of cash, the issuance to the selling entity of 102,883 common units of limited partnership interest in Boston Properties Limited Partnership and the assumption of approximately $1.9 billion of secured and mezzanine loans having a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 5.97% per annum, all of which mature in October 2017. In addition, the venture acquired the lenders' interest in a portion of the assumed mezzanine loans having an aggregate principal amount of $294.0 million and a stated interest rate of 6.02% per annum for a purchase price of approximately $263.1 million in cash. The purchase price was financed in part with loans from the venture's partners on a pro rata basis totaling $450.0 million, which bear interest at fixed rate of 11.0% per annum and mature on June 9, 2017.
 
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying Statement has been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, this Statement excludes certain historical expenses not comparable to the operations of the Property after acquisition such as certain ancillary income, amortization, depreciation, interest, corporate expenses and certain other costs not directly related to the future operations of the Property.
An audited statement is being presented for the most recent fiscal year available instead of the three most recent years based on the following factors: (i) the Property was acquired from an unaffiliated party and (ii) based on the investigation of the Property, the Company is not aware of any material factors, other that those factors described above, relating to the Property that would cause this financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results.
Rental Revenue
Rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. The excess of recognized rentals over amounts due pursuant to lease terms is recorded as accrued rent. The impact of the straight-line rent adjustment increased revenue by approximately $8.6 million and $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and for the period from January 1, 2008 through June 8, 2008 (unaudited), respectively.
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 141 "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141"), rental revenue of acquired in-place "above-" and "below-market" leases has been recognized at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. The impact of the acquired in-place "above-" and "below-market" lease adjustment increased revenue by approximately $25.8 million and $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and for the period from January 1, 2008 through June 8, 2008 (unaudited), respectively.
 
Certain leases provide for percentage rents based upon the levels of sales achieved by the lessee. Percentage rent is recognized once the required sales level has been achieved.
Rental revenue includes amounts recognized in connection with lease termination agreements totaling approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. There were no amounts recognized from lease termination agreements for the period from January 1, 2008 through June 8, 2008 (unaudited).
Unaudited Interim Information
The Statement for the period from January 1, 2008 through June 8, 2008 is unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of such Statement (in accordance with the Basis of Presentation as described in Note 2) have been included. The results of operations for the period are not necessarily indicative of the Property's future results of operations.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the accompanying Statement in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
The office and retail space is leased to tenants under leases with terms that vary in length. Certain leases contain reimbursement clauses and renewal options. Minimum lease payments due under non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of June 9, 2008 (unaudited), for the remainder of 2008 and annually thereafter are as follows:
 
As of December 31, 2007 and June 9, 2008, two tenants leased approximately 43% of the leasable square feet of the Property with base rent totaling approximately $50.8 million and $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and for the period from January 1, 2008 through June 8, 2008 (unaudited), respectively.
 
In connection with the acquisition, the joint venture assumed approximately $1.9 billion of secured and mezzanine loans (the "Assumed Debt"), which loans had been refinanced in September 2007, having a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 5.97% per annum, all of which mature in October 2017. In addition, the venture acquired the lenders' interest in a portion of the assumed mezzanine loans having an aggregate principal amount of $294.0 million and a stated interest rate of 6.02% per annum for a purchase price of approximately $263.1 million in cash. As a result of the debt refinancing in September 2007 and the venture's acquisition of the lenders' interest in a portion of the assumed mezzanine loans, the interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 and the period from January 1, 2008 through June 8, 2008 is not comparable to future operations of the Property and has been excluded from the Statement.
 
On January 7, 2005, the owners of the Property entered into a property management agreement with an affiliate of Macklowe (the "Property Manager"). Under this agreement, the Property Manager provided overall property management services and received a fee equal to approximately $0.9 million per annum as compensation for its services through January 2007. On February 22, 2007, a new agreement was executed increasing the compensation of the Property Manager's services to $1.7 million per annum. Property management fees totaling approximately $1.7 million and $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and for the period from January 1, 2008 through June 8, 2008 (unaudited) were incurred and are included within the caption Management Fees in the Statement.
On April 1, 2005, the owner of the Property entered into a lease for approximately 26,284 rentable square feet of office space with an affiliate of Macklowe. The lease expires in October 2025. Rental revenue totaling approximately $2.3 million and approximately $1.0 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2007 and for the period from January 1, 2008 through June 8, 2008 (unaudited), respectively.
 
The Property is subject to legal claims and disputes in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the ultimate settlement of any existing potential claims and disputes would not have a material impact on the Property's revenue and certain expenses.
The Property may be potentially liable for costs and damages related to environmental matters, including asbestos-containing materials that may be located at the Property. The Property has not been notified by any governmental authority of any non-compliance, liability or other claim, and management is not aware of any environmental condition that management believes will have a material adverse effect on the Property's revenue and certain expenses.
The accompanying unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements of Boston Properties, Inc. (the "Company") are presented as if the acquisition and the related assumption of mortgage indebtedness of the General Motors Building, which was completed on June 9, 2008 through a joint venture in which the Company has a 60% interest, had been consummated on January 1, 2007.
The Company has not presented a Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet of Boston Properties, Inc. as of June 30, 2008, because the impact of the acquisition of the General Motors Building, which was completed on June 9, 2008, is already reflected as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture in the Consolidated Balance Sheet of Boston Properties, Inc. as of June 30, 2008, which is included in Boston Properties, Inc.'s Form 10-Q which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 11, 2008.
The accompanying unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations for the six months ended June 30, 2008 and for the year ended December 31, 2007 are presented as if the acquisition on June 9, 2008 of the General Motors Building, through a joint venture in which the Company has a 60% interest, and the related assumption of mortgage indebtedness, had occurred on January 1, 2007.
These Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company, reported on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and on Form 10-Q for the six months ended June 30, 2008.
The unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated financial information prepared by Boston Properties' management is not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations would have been for the six months ended June 30, 2008 or for the year ended December 31, 2007, had the acquisition on June 9, 2008 of the General Motors Building, through a joint venture in which the Company has a 60% interest, and the related assumption of mortgage indebtedness occurred on January 1, 2007, nor does it purport to present the future results of operations of the Company.
