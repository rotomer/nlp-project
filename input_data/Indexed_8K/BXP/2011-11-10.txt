The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated transaction expenses, are estimated to be approximately $841.2 million. The Company plans to use all or a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay, redeem or repurchase outstanding indebtedness, including its 2.875% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2037 or other debt securities with near-term maturities or repurchase rights.

The material terms of the Notes are described in a prospectus supplement filed by the Company with the Commission on November 7, 2011 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Securities Act.
