NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: ARTICLE I THE MERGER SECTION 1.1 The Merger.

(b) Within five business days after the later to occur of the Election Deadline or the Effective Time (as such terms are defined in Sections 2.3(d) and 1.3, respectively), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 2.3) to effect the allocation among holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows: (i) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Stock Election shall have been made (the "Stock Election Number") exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof (other than Stock Election Shares held by the Ford Parties, all of which shall be converted into Stock Consideration) will be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder (other than the Ford Parties) by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number less the number of Stock Election Shares held by the Ford Parties and the denominator of which is the Stock Election Number less the number of Stock Election Shares held by the Ford Parties, with the remaining number of such holder's Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and (ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner: (A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; or (B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares and the denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holder's Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration. SECTION 2.3 Election and Exchange Procedures. Each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) ("Holder") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II, to submit an election in accordance with the following procedures: (a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this Section (herein called an "Election") (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election. (b) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Form of Election") which shall be mailed to the Company's stockholders entitled to vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting so as to permit the Company's stockholders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline (as defined in subsection (d)). (c) Parent shall make the Form of Election initially available at the time that the Proxy Statement (as defined herein) is made available to the stockholders of the Company, to such stockholders, and shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any stockholder of the Company who requests such Form of Election following the initial mailing of the Forms of Election and prior to the Election Deadline. In no event shall the Form of Election be made available less than twenty (20) days prior to the Election Deadline. (d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the person authorized to receive Elections and to act as exchange agent under this Agreement, which person shall be designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), shall have received, by 5:00 p.m. local time in the city in which the principal office of such Exchange Agent is located, on the date of the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by certificates of the shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Stock Certificates") to which such Form of Election relates or by an appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States; provided, that such certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery. Failure to deliver shares of Company Common Stock covered by such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise determined by Parent, in its sole discretion. As used herein, "Election Deadline" means 5:00 p.m. on the date that is the day prior to the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) business days before, and at least five (5) business days prior to, the Election Deadline. (e) Any Company stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed, revised Form of Election. If Parent shall determine in its reasonable discretion that any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made. (f) Any Company stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or her Company Stock Certificate, or of the guarantee of delivery of such certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent or the Company that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VII. (g) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name a Company Stock Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that such Company Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes (as defined in Section 3.1(j)) required as a result of such payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Company Stock Certificate, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent. (h) After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration or transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II. (i) At any time following the nine month anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any remaining portion of the Merger Consideration not distributed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock that was deposited with the Exchange Agent at the Effective Time (the "Exchange Fund") (including any interest received with respect thereto and other income resulting from investments by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent), and holders shall be entitled to look only to the Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock payable upon due surrender of their Company Stock Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Company Stock Certificate for Merger Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. (j) In the event any Company Stock Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Stock Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate(s), the Exchange Agent will issue the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificates. (k) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to subsection (l) below, and all such dividends, other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with subsection (l) below. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Company Stock Certificate there shall be paid to the holder of a certificate for Parent Common Stock (a "Parent Stock Certificate") representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to subsection (l), and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent cash for these purposes, if necessary. (l) No Parent Stock Certificates representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Stock Certificates; no dividend or distribution by Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests; and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of a Company Stock Certificate who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share interest in exchange for such Company Stock Certificate shall receive from the Exchange Agent an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the Closing Parent Share Value. (m) Parent shall have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (A) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any Company Stockholder with the Election procedures set forth herein, (B) the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations prescribed by Section 2.3, (C) the issuance and delivery of Parent Stock Certificates into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted in the Merger and (D) the method of payment of cash for shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock where the holder of the applicable Company Stock Certificate has no right to receive whole shares of Parent Common Stock. (n) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent will deposit with the Exchange Agent certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to pay in a timely manner, and the Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay, the aggregate Stock Consideration. In addition, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent on a daily basis sufficient cash to permit prompt payment of the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock where the holder of the applicable Company Stock Certificate has no right to receive whole shares of Parent Common Stock. (o) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Company Stock Certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor who did not complete an Election Form, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Stock Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates) (the "Letter of Transmittal") to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Company Stock Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.3(l) and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(k). (p) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Company Stock Certificate or Company Stock Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Form of Election or a properly completed Letter of Transmittal a holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration (elected or deemed elected by it, subject to Sections 2.1 and 2.2) in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by its Company Stock Certificate. Until so surrendered, each such Company Stock Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.3(l) and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(k). SECTION 2.4 Certain Adjustments. If after the date hereof and on or prior to the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization or combination, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or rights issued in respect of such stock, or any similar event shall occur (any such action, an "Adjustment Event"), the Aggregate Parent Share Amount shall be adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such Adjustment Event; provided, further, that, in the case of an Adjustment Event in respect of the distribution of shares of Travelers Property and Casualty Corp. capital stock to Parent's stockholders, the Aggregate Parent Share Amount shall be adjusted by determining the value of the distribution based on the NYSE methodology for setting the opening trading price for shares of Parent Common Stock on the date that shares of Parent Common Stock begin trading on an ex-dividend basis (which valuation methodology is the same methodology that will be used in the anti-dilution adjustments made to the outstanding employee stock options to purchase Parent Common Stock). SECTION 2.5 Shares of Dissenting Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who has properly exercised his appraisal rights under the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until the holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, his right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL and to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the DGCL. If any such holder shall have so failed to perfect or have effectively withdrawn or lost such right after the Election Deadline, each share of such holder's Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Stock Election Consideration or the Cash Election Consideration or a combination thereof as determined by Parent in its sole discretion. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notice or demands for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands. SECTION 2.6 Litigation Tracking Warrants. Following the Effective Time, the outstanding litigation tracking warrants issued by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock and those held in tandem with stock options outstanding under the Amended and Restated Golden State Bancorp Inc. Stock Option and Long-Term Performance Incentive Plan, as amended (the "LTWs"), whether or not then exercisable, shall be assumed by Parent. Each LTW shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions applicable to such LTW immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that, from and after the Effective Time, each LTW shall, when and if it becomes exercisable in accordance with its terms, be exercisable in respect of Parent Common Stock and cash in the same proportion that the holders of Company Common Stock receive in the aggregate in the Merger as measured as of the Effective Time. Parent shall be solely responsible for the issuance of Parent Common Stock and the delivery of the cash amount upon such exercise. From and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall (A) assume all of the obligations and obtain all of the rights of the Company under the Warrant Agreement and in connection with the LTWs and (B) be solely responsible for the issuance of Parent Common Stock and the delivery of the cash amount upon exercise of the LTWs, and (ii) the Company shall have no further rights and obligations under the Warrant Agreement and in connection with the LTWs.

SECTION 4.3 No Solicitation by the Company. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 4.3, until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date of termination of this Agreement, neither the Company, nor any of its subsidiaries or any of the officers, directors, agents, representatives or affiliates of it or its subsidiaries (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its subsidiaries) shall (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information), or take any other action designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal which constitutes a Company Takeover Proposal (as defined below), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Company Takeover Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Company Takeover Proposal or (iv) make or authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any Company Takeover Proposal. If and only to the extent that (i) the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not have occurred, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable law, (iii) the Company's Board of Directors concludes in good faith that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal (as defined below), (iv) such Company Takeover Proposal was not solicited by it and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.3(a), and (v) the Company provides prior written notice to Parent of its decision to take such action, the Company shall be permitted to (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and any of its subsidiaries to such person pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement, (B) participate in discussions and negotiations with such person, (C) subject to first complying with the provisions of Section 5.8(b) hereof, enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement and (D) effect a Change in the Company Recommendation (as defined below); provided, that at least five business days prior to taking any actions set forth in clause (C) or (D) above, the Company's Board of Directors provides Parent written notice advising Parent that the Company's Board of Directors is prepared to conclude that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and during such five business day period the Company and its advisors shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Company Takeover Proposal would no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal and the Company's Board of Directors fully considers any such adjustment and nonetheless concludes in good faith that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal. The Company, its subsidiaries and their representatives immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of any equity securities of the Company, or any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or any subsidiary of the Company whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole), other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Company Superior Proposal" means any proposal made by a third party (A) to acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including a contribution to a joint venture), dissolution or similar transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, 100% of the combined voting power of the shares of the Company's capital stock then outstanding or 100% of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (B) which is otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with (i) either Goldman Sachs & Co. or another nationally recognized investment banking firm and (ii) outside counsel), taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal, that the proposal, (i) if consummated would result in a transaction that is more favorable to the Company's stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, including to the extent required, financing which is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, is reasonably capable of being obtained by such third party. (b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 4.3, neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval of the Agreement, the Merger or the Company Recommendation (as defined in Section 5.1(d)) or take any action or make any statement in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such approval or Company Recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the Company Recommendation"), (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal, or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement") related to any Company Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the Company Recommendation shall include any approval or recommendation (or public proposal to approve or recommend), by the Company Board of a Company Takeover Proposal, or any failure by the Company Board to recommend against a Company Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company, to the extent that it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that in light of a Company Superior Proposal it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable law, may terminate this Agreement solely in order to concurrently enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Company Superior Proposal, but only at a time that is after the fifth business day following Parent's receipt of the written notice specified in Section 4.3(a) and compliance by the Company with the terms of Sections 4.3(a) and 5.8(b). (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.3, the Company shall immediately advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for information relating to a Company Takeover Proposal, or of any Company Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or Company Takeover Proposal and the identity of the person making such request or Company Takeover Proposal, and shall promptly provide a copy of any written request or Company Takeover Proposal to Parent. The Company will keep Parent promptly informed of the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or Company Takeover Proposal. (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.3 shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to disclose would violate its obligations under applicable law; provided, however, any such disclosure relating to a Company Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in the Company Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of the Company reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such disclosure. SECTION 4.4 Certain Tax Matters. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to: (i) timely file (taking into account any extensions of time within which to file) all Tax Returns ("Post-Signing Returns") required to be filed by it and such Post-Signing Returns shall be prepared in a manner reasonably consistent with past practice; (ii) timely pay all Taxes shown as due and payable on such Post-Signing Returns that are so filed; (iii) accrue a reserve in its books and records and financial statements in accordance with past practice for all Taxes payable by it for which no Post-Signing Return is due prior to the Effective Time; and (iv) promptly notify Parent of any material suit, claim, action, investigation, proceeding or audit (collectively, "Actions") pending against or with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries in respect of any Tax matter, including (without limitation) Tax liabilities and refund claims.

Commencing following the date hereof, Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to facilitate the integration of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank, with the businesses of Parent and its subsidiaries to be effective as of the Closing Date.

(b) The Company shall adopt such resolutions and take all such other actions as may be required to permit the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.6, including, but not limited to the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock held or to be awarded or paid pursuant to such benefit plans, programs or arrangements into shares of Parent Common Stock on a basis consistent with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 5.8(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 5.8(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the fee set forth in this Section 5.8(b), the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the rate on six-month U.S. Treasury obligations plus 300 basis points in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

New York, New York 10043 Attention: Assistant General Counsel, M&A Ladies and Gentlemen: I have been advised that I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Golden State Bancorp Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), as that term is defined in Rule 145 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). I understand that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 21, 2002 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Citigroup Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Mercury Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub") and the Company, the Company plans to merge with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger") with Merger Sub being the surviving corporation. Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Merger Agreement. I further understand that, as a result of the Merger, in exchange for shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") or upon the exercise of the Company Stock Options that will be assumed by Parent in the Merger ("Assumed Options"), I may receive common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock"). I have read this letter and discussed the requirements hereof to the extent I felt necessary with my counsel or counsel for the Company. I represent, warrant and covenant with and to Parent that in the event I receive any Parent Common Stock as a result of the Merger or the exercise of Assumed Options: 1. I shall not make any sale, transfer, or other disposition of such Parent Common Stock unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (as such rule may be amended from time to time), (iii) in the opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or under a "no-action" letter or interpretive letter from the staff of the SEC, such sale, transfer or other disposition will not violate or is otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities Act, or (iii) I have the right to have the legend set forth in Sections 3 and 4 below removed pursuant to Section 4 below. 2. I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Securities Act or, other than as set forth below, to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available. 3. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Parent's transfer agent with respect to the Parent Common Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger or the exercise of Assumed Options and that there will be placed on the certificates, if any, for such shares, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: "The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares represented by this certificate may be transferred only in accordance with the terms of a letter agreement between the registered holder hereof and Citigroup Inc., a copy of which agreement is on file at the principal offices of Citigroup Inc." 4. I understand that, unless the transfer by me of the Parent Common Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger or upon the exercise of Assumed Options has been registered under the Securities Act or such transfer is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act, Parent reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to place the following legend on the certificates, if any, issued to my transferee: "The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of except pursuant to an effective registration statement under, or in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of, the Securities Act of 1933." It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs (3) and (4) above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend and/or any stop transfer instructions will be lifted (A) if one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the date I acquired the Parent Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) (or any successor thereto) are then available to me, (B) if two years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the date I acquired the Parent Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) (or any successor thereto) are then available to me or (C) if I shall have delivered to Parent (i) a copy of a "no-action" letter or interpretative letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act or (ii) a written statement from me representing that that the Parent Common Stock represented by such certificates are being or have been sold in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) or pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act. Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my part of "affiliate" status as described in the first paragraph of this letter agreement, or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

If Parent has received an IRS Form 5701 or similar written assertion from a taxing authority within 90 days of the receipt of such Written Notice (a "Proposed Adjustment"), then the applicable Held Back Shares shall remain in escrow until the final resolution of any Tax Claims arising out of or relating to such Proposed Adjustment (at which time and following the release of such Held Back Shares to Parent that Parent may become so entitled to, all remaining Held Back Shares with respect to such Tax Claims shall be released to GSB Investments and HG/F as provided for in Section 6(c)(ii)(B) or Section 6(c)(ii)(C) above).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount of any Tax Claim is not reasonably ascertainable or the Securityholders' Representative and Parent fail to agree as to the amount of any Tax Claim, "Held Back Shares" shall mean that number of Escrow Shares determined by the Auditor pursuant to the procedure set forth in Section 11(i) hereof until the amount of such Tax Claim becomes reasonably ascertainable or agreed to by the Securityholders' Representative and Parent, and thereafter "Held Back Shares" shall mean that number of Escrow Shares as calculated pursuant to the previous sentence. (iii) Payment in Satisfaction of Federal Net Tax Benefits. (A) Notwithstanding any provision of the 1998 Merger Agreement to the contrary, the right of the Major Shareholders to receive 5,370,182 shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6(c) of the 1998 Merger Agreement with respect to Federal Net Tax Benefits realized by the Taxpayer in respect of the Taxable Period ending December 31, 2001 less the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued prior to the Closing Date by the Company pursuant to Section 1.6(c) of the 1998 Merger Agreement to the Major Shareholders for such Taxable Period (such remaining amount of shares to be received by the Major Shareholders is referred to herein as the "Settled Tax Shares") shall be settled and extinguished in full, at the Effective Time, by the issuance to the Major Shareholders by the Company of the Settled Tax Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Settled Tax Shares shall be allocated between the Major Shareholders based upon the portion of such Settled Tax Shares to which each Major Shareholder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(c) of the 1998 Merger Agreement. This Section 6(c)(iii)(A) shall be effective as of the Closing Date and the 1998 Merger Agreement shall be amended and supplemented pursuant to this Section 6(c)(iii)(A) as of the Effective Time.

(C) Subject to Section 6(c)(iii)(F) and (G) hereof: (W) Upon the settlement of an audit by the IRS of any or all of the Federal consolidated income tax returns of the MFI Group for the 1991 through 1995 taxable years, the California Federal Bank consolidated group for the 1993 through 1995 taxable years and the CalFed Bancorp Inc. consolidated group for the 1996 through January 3, 1997 taxable years, in each case as evidenced by an appropriate IRS Form 4549 signed by an IRS examiner and agreed to by the Taxpayer, (x) Tax Benefits shall be adjusted and such adjustment shall be reviewed and attested to by KPMG LLP ("KPMG"), and (y) Federal Net Tax Benefits shall be recalculated and such recalculation shall be reviewed and attested to by KPMG, each as provided in Section 1.6(c)(iv) of the 1998 Merger Agreement. Section 1.6(c) of the 1998 Merger Agreement shall apply to the increase or decrease of Federal Net Tax Benefits for any taxable period of the Company ending on or prior to the Closing Date, resulting from such recalculation. Within ten days after the later of the attestation by KPMG of the recalculation of Federal Net Tax Benefits described above and the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare (and the Major Shareholders shall cooperate in such preparation (including by providing such information that is necessary for such preparation)), and deliver to the Securityholders' Representative a written estimate of the taxable periods of Parent in which Tax Benefits arising in whichever of the 1991 through 1995 taxable years of the MFI Group, the California Federal Bank consolidated group for the 1993 through 1995 taxable years and the CalFed Bancorp Inc. consolidated group for the 1996 through January 3, 1997 taxable years that has been settled as described above, (other than those Tax Benefits utilized in the calculation of Federal Net Tax Benefits for any taxable period of the Company ending on or prior to the Closing Date or Federal Net Tax Benefits described in Section 6(c)(iii)(B) hereof and which have been previously paid for pursuant to Section 1.6(c) of the 1998 Merger Agreement or pursuant to Section 6(c)(iii)(A) or Section 6(c)(iii)(B) above) will be utilized and an estimate of the Federal Net Tax Benefits that would result from such estimated utilization (the "Estimated Federal Net Tax Benefits") for each taxable period (such written estimate, the "Utilization Estimate"). The parties agree that Estimated Federal Net Tax Benefits shall be determined giving effect to only the "Section 382 Limitation" (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code) imposed as a result of the Merger. Unless the Securityholders' Representative objects to the Utilization Estimate in writing delivered to Parent within ten days of delivery of the Utilization Estimate by Parent, such Utilization Estimate will be deemed to be accepted by the Major Shareholders. In the event that the Securityholders' Representative timely objects to the Utilization Estimate, Section 11(i) hereof shall apply to such objection and disagreement. The date upon which the Utilization Estimate is deemed accepted or upon which a disagreement resulting from a timely objection to the Utilization Estimate is resolved is referred to herein as the "Acceptance Date." (X) Each of the Major Shareholders shall be entitled to elect, within ten days of the Acceptance Date, by notifying Parent in writing (the date of such notification, the "Notice Date"), to receive, and upon such valid election (or, if later, immediately after the Effective Time) Parent shall issue, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (x) the present value, as of the Notice Date, of an amount equal to the Estimated Federal Net Tax Benefits, divided by (y) the Parent Share Value as of the Notice Date. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the present value of the Estimated Federal Net Tax Benefits shall be calculated based upon a discount rate of 3 month LIBOR plus 365 basis points per annum compounded annually and assuming that the Estimated Federal Net Tax Benefits for any taxable period are recognized pro rata on each Quarterly Date in such taxable period. The issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Section 6(c)(iii)(C)(X) shall be in full satisfaction of and shall extinguish any right of the electing Major Shareholder to receive shares of Parent Common Stock with respect to the Tax Benefits utilized in the calculation of Estimated Federal Net Tax Benefits. In the event that only one of the Major Shareholders validly elects pursuant to this Section 6(c)(iii)(C)(X), the provisions of this Section 6(c)(iii)(C) shall be interpreted to take into account the non-electing Major Shareholders' proportionate interest in Tax Benefits, Estimated Federal Net Tax Benefits and Federal Net Tax Benefits. (Y) In the absence of a valid election pursuant to Section 6(c)(iii)(C)(X) hereof, the right of the Major Shareholders to receive shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6(c) of the 1998 Merger Agreement in respect of the Tax Benefits utilized in the calculation of Estimated Federal Net Tax Benefits shall be settled and extinguished in exchange for the issuance, on each Quarterly Date in each taxable period of Parent, to the Major Shareholders by Parent of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (x) the Estimated Federal Net Tax Benefits treated as recognized on such Quarterly Date, divided by (y) the Parent Share Value on such Quarterly Date in such taxable period. For purposes of this Section 6(c)(iii)(C)(Y), Estimated Federal Net Tax Benefits with respect to any taxable period of Parent shall be treated as recognized pro rata on each Quarterly Date in such taxable period. For purposes of this Agreement and Section 1.6(c) of the 1998 Merger Agreement, any payment of shares of Parent Common Stock with respect to Estimated Federal Net Tax Benefits shall be treated as a payment with respect to Federal Net Tax Benefits. (Z) Within ten days after the filing of the Federal income tax return of Parent for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date, Parent shall calculate, in good faith, the amount of Federal Net Tax Benefits for such taxable period. In the event that Federal Net Tax Benefits for such taxable period resulting from Tax Benefits arising in any or all of the 1991 through 1995 taxable years of the MFI Group, the California Federal Bank consolidated group for the 1993 through 1995 taxable years and the CalFed Bancorp Inc. consolidated group for the 1996 through January 3, 1997 taxable years (other than those Tax Benefits utilized in the calculation of Federal Net Tax Benefits for any taxable period of the Company ending on or prior to the Closing Date or Federal Net Tax Benefits described in Section 6(c)(iii)(B) hereof and which have been previously paid for pursuant to Section 6(c)(iii)(A) or Section 6(c)(iii)(B) above) differ from Estimated Federal Net Tax Benefits for such period, (x) such difference shall be treated as a recalculation of Federal Net Tax Benefits for purposes of Section 1.6(c)(iv) of the 1998 Merger Agreement, and (y) Estimated Federal Net Tax Benefits for succeeding taxable periods of Parent shall be adjusted accordingly. (D) Subject to Sections 6(c)(iii)(F) and (G) hereof, any payment with respect to Federal Net Tax Benefits pursuant to Section 1.6(c) of the 1998 Merger Agreement, other than those described in Sections 6(c)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) hereof, shall be made in accordance with the 1998 Merger Agreement, except that after the Effective Time, (i) such payments shall be made in Parent Common Stock based upon the Parent Share Value and (ii) in the case of any payments relating to any amount described in Section 1.6(c)(ii)(C)(2) of the 1998 Merger Agreement, such payments shall be made within five days after the relevant refunds are received by Parent or any of its subsidiaries. In the event that a Federal income tax refund is received after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, such refund shall be treated as having been received immediately after the Effective Time for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence. In the event that a Federal Net Tax Benefit relating to Secondary Tax Benefits arises in respect of any shares issued pursuant to Section 6(c)(iii)(A) hereof or Section 1.6 of the 1998 Merger Agreement after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, payment for such Federal Net Tax Benefit shall be made within 10 days after the Effective Time in Parent Common Stock based upon the then Parent Share Value based upon a schedule to be prepared by the Securityholders' Representative and submitted to Parent for Parent's approval not later than 5 days after the Effective Time (with any disagreement relating to such schedule subject to the provisions of Section 11(i)). (E) Notwithstanding anything in the penultimate sentence of Section 1.6(c)(iii) of the 1998 Merger Agreement to the contrary, following the Effective Time, any return of a Tax Payment (such return payment, the "Returned Payment") made within six months of such Tax Payment (the "Original Payment") shall be made in the number of shares of Parent Common Stock having an aggregate Parent Share Value as of the date of the Original Payment equal to the amount of the Returned Payment, provided, further, that if the Original Payment was made in shares of Company Common Stock, then the Returned Payment shall be made in the number of shares of Parent Common Stock having an aggregate value (based upon the Company Share Value as of the date of the Original Payment divided by the Exchange Ratio) equal to the amount of the Returned Payment. (F) The obligation of Parent to make payments pursuant to Section 1.6(c) of the 1998 Merger Agreement, but only those payments that are described in Sections 6(c)(iii)(C) and (D) hereof (exclusive of Federal Net Tax Benefits relating to Secondary Tax Benefits), shall be limited to payments in respect of Federal Net Tax Benefits that, in the aggregate, do not exceed $250,000,000. In the event that Parent makes payments pursuant to Section 1.6(c) of the Merger Agreement and Sections 6(c)(iii)(C) and (D) hereof in respect of, in the aggregate, $250,000,000 of Federal Net Tax Benefits (exclusive of Federal Net Tax Benefits relating to Secondary Tax Benefits), and has complied with its obligations under Sections 6(c)(iii)(A) and 6(c)(iii)(B), Parent shall have no obligation to make any additional payments pursuant to Section 1.6(c) of the Merger Agreement or Sections 6(c)(iii)(C) or (D) hereof. (G) In the event that Parent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates shall be entitled to indemnification for Damages under Section 9 hereof or indemnification by MFI pursuant to Section 7 of the Tax Sharing Agreement, then in the sole discretion of Parent, in lieu of the issuance and delivery of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 6(c)(iii)(B), (C) or (D) hereof, Parent shall be entitled to off-set the amount of any outstanding MFI Damages against shares otherwise issuable to GSB Investments pursuant to Section 6(c)(iii)(B), (C) or (D) hereof, and to off-set the amount of any outstanding HG/F Damages against shares otherwise issuable to HG/F pursuant to Section 6(c)(iii)(B), (C) or (D) hereof. The aggregate amount of such off-set shall equal the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock with a Parent Share Value (as of the date such off-set is applied) equal to the MFI Damages and/or the HG/F Damages, as the case may be. In the event that the right to off-set is exercised as described above, the shares shall be treated as having been issued by Parent for purposes of calculating the limitation described in Section 6(c)(iii)(F) above. In the event that, at a time at which Parent is otherwise required to issue and deliver shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 6(c)(iii)(B), (C) or (D) hereof, (X) the aggregate value of the Escrow Shares then held in the MFI Subaccount (based on the Parent Share Value as of such issuance date) is less than (an "MFI Shortfall") the Applicable MFI Minimum Amount, then notwithstanding anything in Section 6(c)(iii)(B), (C) or (D) to the contrary and irrespective of any off-set pursuant to this Section 6(c)(iii)(G), a number of shares of Parent Common Stock with a value (calculated as provided above) equal to the MFI Shortfall shall be delivered by Parent on the date that they are required to be issued under any of the foregoing subsections (B), (C) or (D) to the Escrow Agent to be held in Escrow, allocated to the MFI Subaccount; or (Y) the aggregate value of the Escrow Shares then held in the HG/F Subaccount (based on the Parent Share Value as of such issuance date) is less than (an "HG/F Shortfall") an the Applicable HG/F Minimum Amount, then notwithstanding anything in Section 6(c)(iii)(B), (C) or (D) to the contrary and irrespective of any off-set pursuant to this Section 6(c)(iii)(G), a number of shares of Parent Common Stock with a value (calculated as provided above) equal to the HG/F Shortfall shall be delivered by Parent on the date that they are required to be issued under any of the foregoing subsections (B), (C) or (D) to the Escrow Agent to be held in Escrow, allocated to the HG/F Subaccount. (H) Except as provided in Section 6(c)(iii)(A) above, all amounts payable pursuant to Section 6(c)(iii) hereof shall be paid 80% to GSB Investments and 20% HG/F. (I) Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause any Tax Benefits to be utilized in the earliest taxable period of Parent. (J) Parent shall calculate Federal Net Tax Benefits for purposes of this Agreement, and shall reflect on its Tax Returns items included in the calculation of Federal Net Tax Benefits, in a manner consistent with the Company's past practice. (K) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the 1998 Merger Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to Federal Net Tax Benefits, or any items included in the calculation thereof, that are reflected as an asset on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2002, to the extent that such amounts are not offset by a corresponding liability or equity item. (L) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent be required to issue any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement. In the event any fractional share of Parent Common Stock would otherwise be issuable hereunder, such share shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. (iv) Deleted Provisions and Amended Definitions. Effective as of the Effective Time: (A) Sections 1.6(a)(ii), 1.6(a)(iii) and 1.6(e)(vi) and the first two sentences of Section 1.6(c)(iii) of the 1998 Merger Agreement are hereby deleted. (B) The definition of "CFB Litigation Distribution Amount" in the 1998 Merger Agreement shall be substituted and replaced with: "'CFB Litigation Distribution Amount' shall mean the excess (if any) of (x) the sum of (A) the amount of the Net Cash Payment and (B) the CFB Litigation Tax Benefits, over (y) an amount equal to $12,000,000 plus 25% of the excess of the Net Cash Payment over $12,000,000." (d) Survival of Provisions. Unless expressly amended or superseded hereby, the provisions of the 1998 Merger Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. All references to the 1998 Merger Agreement shall be deemed to be references to the 1998 Merger Agreement, as amended and supplemented hereby. (e) Performance. MFI shall cause GSB Investments to perform all of GSB Investments' obligations under this Agreement and the 1998 Merger Agreement. Ford shall cause HG/F to perform all of HG/F's obligations under this Agreement and the 1998 Merger Agreement. 7. Waiver of Claims. Effective as of the Effective Time, each of the Securityholders hereby waives, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, in all capacities, including as stockholders, officers and/or directors of the Company or Sub or any of their subsidiaries at and after the Effective Time, any and all claims of itself and its subsidiaries, including cross claims, against the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees or agents connected with or arising out of (a) any act or omission of any of the Company or its subsidiaries, affiliates or their respective officers, directors, employees, legal advisors or agents, in such capacity, at or prior to the Effective Time, including, without limitation, with respect to the negotiation of the terms of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, and the other agreements, documents and instruments to be executed therewith, and (b) any claims arising out of the management or handling of the Goodwill Litigation, the Glendale Litigation or the Guarini Litigation; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed a waiver by the Securityholders of any rights under Article II of the Merger Agreement to receive the Merger Consideration, of any rights as a director or officer of the Company or its subsidiaries under Section 5.7 of the Merger Agreement (including any rights under other agreements or arrangements referred to therein) or of any rights under Section 1.6 of the 1998 Merger Agreement or this Agreement. In consideration of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that the Securityholders shall be entitled to manage the Guarini Litigation pursuant to arrangements reasonably acceptable to Parent to be entered into prior to the Effective Time. 8. No Tampering. None of the MFI Parties nor any affiliate thereof shall, from and after the Closing Date, (a) until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, use or disclose to others any of the customer lists or other confidential proprietary information of the Company or its subsidiaries in connection with retail banking or otherwise, (b) until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, solicit, directly or indirectly, for employment, any of the officers or employees of the Company or its subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, for so long as they remain employees of the Company or its subsidiaries or their respective successors or permitted assigns, (c) until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, request, induce or attempt to influence any distributor or supplier of goods or services to the Company or any subsidiary thereof as of the Closing Date to curtail or cancel any business they may transact with the Company or such subsidiary thereof or their respective successors or permitted assigns for so long as such distributor or supplier continues in such capacity with the Company or its subsidiaries or their respective successors or permitted assigns; or (d) take any action to aid or assist Mr. Ford or his affiliates in the breach of Section 13 of that certain employment agreement between California Federal Bank and Gerald J. Ford, dated as of January 1, 2000, as amended on March 19, 2002 and the date hereof, whether by providing financing or otherwise. 9. Indemnification. From and after the Effective Time and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Tax Sharing Agreement: (a) Subject to the procedures described herein and effective as of the Effective Time, MFI, GSB Investments and MFH (collectively, the "MFI Parties"), jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and the Company and their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, agents and controlling Persons (other than the Securityholders), and each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Indemnitees"), against and from any of the following Damages (the "MFI Party Damages"): (i) 100% of any Damages incurred or suffered by the Indemnitees as a result of liability for Taxes of members of the MFI Group (other than the Company and its subsidiaries and their predecessors) imposed pursuant to Treas. Reg. ss. 1.1502-6 (or any comparable provision of state, local or foreign law), and (ii) 80% of any Damages incurred or suffered by the Indemnitees as a result of an adjustment to or disallowance of any Federal Net Tax Benefit for which the Major Shareholders have received payment or item included in the calculation thereof (other than any adjustment to the manner in which such Federal Net Tax Benefit or item is utilized in any taxable period ending after the Closing Date). Subject to the procedures described herein, HG/F shall indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnitees against and from 20% of any Damages incurred or suffered by the Indemnitees as a result of an adjustment to or disallowance of any Federal Net Tax Benefit for which the Major Shareholders have received payment or item included in the calculation thereof (other than any adjustment to the manner in which such Federal Net Tax Benefit or item is utilized in any taxable period ending after the Closing Date) (the "HG/F Party Damages"). This Section 9(a) shall supplement and clarify any indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 1.6(c) of the 1998 Merger Agreement and Section 7 of the Tax Sharing Agreement and shall not be construed to terminate, or to duplicate, any such obligation. (b) Any recovery made by an Indemnitee under this Section 9 shall be made, as elected by Parent in its sole discretion, by the off-set in accordance with Section 6(c)(iii)(G) hereof and/or by release of Escrow Shares from the Escrow prior to seeking direct recovery for Damages by the MFI Parties or HG/F, as applicable; provided, however, that the offset pursuant to Section 6(c)(iii)(G) hereof and the release of the Escrow Shares to Parent shall not be the exclusive remedy of the Indemnitees with respect to Damages. (c) (i) In order for an Indemnitee to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Section 9 in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made or a proceeding initiated by any Person against an Indemnitee including any audit, deficiency, assessment, examination, administrative or other court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim relating to taxes (any such claim, a "Tax Claim"), such Indemnitee must notify the Securityholders' Representative (as defined in Section 11(h) below) in writing of the Tax Claim promptly; provided, however, that failure to give such notification promptly shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent that the Securityholders shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure to provide prompt notification. (ii) The Securityholders' Representative may request that Parent (on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries) initiate a claim for refund of Taxes that would be included in the calculation of Federal Net Tax Benefits. Parent shall file or prosecute (or allow the Securityholders' Representative to prosecute in accordance with Section 9(d) below) such claim for refund unless it determines, in good faith, that Parent and its subsidiaries will be materially adversely affected by the filing or prosecution of such claim for refund (any such claim for refund approved and filed by Parent and any claim for refund initiated prior to the Effective Time, a "Claim for Refund"). (d) Notwithstanding Section 9(e), the Securityholders' Representative shall be entitled to defend any Tax Claim or prosecute any Claim for Refund relating to the Company and its subsidiaries (or any of their respective predecessors or any consolidated group of which any of them was a member) for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, but only to the extent that such Tax Claim or Claim for Refund relates to Federal Net Tax Benefits or items included in the calculation thereof, provided, however, that the Securityholders' Representative notifies the Indemnitee of its desire to defend such Tax Claim within thirty days of the receipt of the notice described in Section 9(c) above or to prosecute such Claim for Refund within thirty days of Parent's approval to initiate such Claim for Refund; provided, further, however, that the Securityholders' Representative shall be deemed to have assumed the prosecution of any Claim for Refund existing at the Effective Time and the defense of any Tax Claim existing at the Effective Time. Upon such notification, the Securityholders' Representative shall be entitled to defend the Tax Claim or prosecute the Claim for Refund with counsel or other tax advisors selected by the Securityholders' Representative; provided, however, that such counsel or other tax advisor is not reasonably objected to by the Indemnitee. If the Securityholders' Representative assumes such defense or prosecution, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the defense or prosecution thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense (which expense shall not be treated as Damages), separate from the counsel employed by the Securityholders' Representative, it being understood that the Securityholders' Representative shall control such defense or prosecution. If the Securityholders' Representative chooses to defend any Tax Claim or prosecute any Claim for Refund in the manner provided by this subsection (d), the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Securityholders' Representative's request) the provision to the Securityholders' Representative of records and information that are relevant to such Tax Claim or Claim for Refund if not already in possession of the Securityholders or the Securityholders' Representative, at the Indemnitees' expense, and the provision of powers of attorney. If the Securityholders' Representative defends any Tax Claim or prosecutes any Claim for Refund, such Securityholders' Representative shall not admit liability with respect to such Tax Claim, or settle, compromise, discharge or otherwise dispose of ("Settle") any such Tax Claim or Claim for Refund without the Indemnitee's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld). (e) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9(d) above, Section 9(f) or this Section 9(e), if a Tax Claim is made against an Indemnitee or Parent initiates a Claim for Refund (including a Tax Claim or Claim for Refund described in Section 9(d) with respect to which the Securityholders' Representative does not provide a valid notice described therein), such Indemnitee shall be entitled to control the defense of and Settle the Tax Claim, and shall be entitled to control the prosecution of and Settle the Claim for Refund, each with counsel selected by such Indemnitee. The Securityholders shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnitee's request) the provision to such Indemnitee of records and information that are relevant to such Tax Claim or Claim for Refund if not already in possession of the Indemnitee, at the Securityholders' expense. For any such Tax Claim relating to a Tax Return affecting Federal Net Tax Benefits or any Claim for Refund, except as provided in Section 9(d) and Section 9(f) hereof, (i) the Securityholders' Representative shall have the right to participate in (but not control) the defense or prosecution thereof and to employ counsel, at the Major Shareholders' expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitee; (ii) if such Tax Claim or Claim for Refund can be separated and handled independently from the Indemnitee's other Tax Claims or refund claims, the Securityholders' Representative shall be entitled to admit liability with respect to or Settle such separated Tax Claim or Settle such Claim for Refund, but only with the Indemnitee's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (iii) if such Tax Claim or Claim for Refund cannot be separated and handled independently from the Indemnitee's other Tax Claims or refund claims, and (A) involves $10 million or less of Federal Net Tax Benefits but does not involve Tax Benefits described in Section 1.6(c)(ii)(A)(2) of the 1998 Merger Agreement ("Secondary Tax Benefits"), the Indemnitee shall be entitled to admit liability with respect to or Settle such Tax Claim, or Settle such Claim for Refund, without the Securityholders' Representative's consent; (B) involves more than $10 million of Federal Net Tax Benefits but does not involve Secondary Tax Benefits, then such Tax Claim or Claim for Refund shall (in the absence of an agreement by the Securityholders' Representative and the Indemnitee) be Settled, (I) subject to clause (II), in the manner proposed by the Securityholders' Representative, but only if the Securityholders' Representative obtains an opinion of nationally recognized tax counsel, reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee, that the position proposed to be taken by the Securityholders' Representative in connection with such Tax Claim should prevail in a court of law, (II) notwithstanding clause (I) and in the discretion of the Indemnitee, in the manner proposed by the Indemnitee, provided, however, that (i) if the Major Shareholders have not yet received payment for the Federal Net Tax Benefits at issue in such Tax Claim or Claim for Refund pursuant to this Agreement or Section 1.6(c) of the 1998 Merger Agreement, Parent shall issue to the Major Shareholders (80% to GSB Investments and 20% to HG/F) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock having a Parent Share Value equal to the excess of the amount of Federal Net Tax Benefits at issue in such Tax Claim or Claim for Refund over $10 million and (ii) if the Major Shareholders have received payment for the Federal Net Tax Benefits at issue in such Tax Claim or Claim for Refund, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for such Tax Claim or Claim for Refund pursuant to Section 9(a) and this clause (II) only to the extent of $10 million; and (III) in the event that no opinion of counsel described above is rendered, in the manner agreed to by the Securityholders' Representative and the Indemnitee or determined by the Auditor pursuant to Section 11(i) hereof; (C) involves Secondary Tax Benefits, then the Indemnitee shall Settle such Tax Claim or Claim for Refund (I) in the manner proposed by the Securityholders' Representative, but only if the Securityholders' Representative obtains an opinion of nationally recognized tax counsel, reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee, that the position proposed to be taken by the Securityholders' Representative in connection with such Tax Claim should prevail in a court of law, and otherwise (II) in the manner agreed to by the Securityholders' Representative and the Indemnitee or determined by the Auditor pursuant to Section 11(i) hereof. (f) Notwithstanding Section 9(e), the Securityholders' Representative shall be entitled to prosecute or defend any Tax Claim relating to the Company and its subsidiaries (or any of their respective predecessors or any unitary group of which any of them was a member) for any taxable period ending on or prior to September 11, 1998, but only to the extent that such Tax Claim relates to a California unitary Franchise Tax Return, provided, however, that the Securityholders' Representative notifies the Indemnitee of its desire to prosecute or defend such Tax Claim within thirty days of the receipt of the notice described in Section 9(c) above; provided, further, however, that the Securityholders' Representative shall be deemed to have assumed the prosecution or defense of any Tax Claim relating to any California unitary Franchise Tax Return that has commenced prior to the Effective Time. Upon such notification, the Securityholders' Representative shall be entitled to prosecute or defend the Tax Claim with counsel or other tax advisors selected by the Securityholders' Representative; provided, however, that such counsel or other tax advisor is not reasonably objected to by the Indemnitee. If the Securityholders' Representative assumes such prosecution or defense, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the prosecution or defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Securityholders' Representative, it being understood that the Securityholders' Representative shall control such prosecution or defense. If the Securityholders' Representative chooses to prosecute or defend any Tax Claim in the manner provided by this subsection (f), the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the prosecution or defense thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Securityholders' Representative's request) the provision to the Securityholders' Representative of records and information that are relevant to such Tax Claim if not already in possession of the Securityholders or the Securityholders' Representative, at the Indemnitees' expense, and the provision of powers of attorney. If the Securityholders' Representative prosecutes or defends any Tax Claim, such Securityholders' Representative shall not Settle any such Tax Claim without the Indemnitee's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld). 10. Termination. This Agreement and the covenants, representations and warranties, agreements and irrevocable proxies contained in or granted pursuant to Section 2, 3 or 4 shall terminate on the date that is twelve months following the date hereof and the covenants, agreements and irrevocable proxies contained in or granted pursuant to Sections 2, 3 and 4 shall terminate upon consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that the provisions of Sections 2, 3 and 4 shall terminate concurrently with a termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(a), (b), (e) and (f) (other than any termination pursuant to Section 7.1(e) resulting from an intentional breach of the Merger Agreement or a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) if a Pre-Termination Company Takeover Proposal Event (as defined in the Merger Agreement) has occurred with respect to the right of termination thereunder). In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VII thereof, the covenants and agreements contained in Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 shall terminate concurrently with such termination of the Merger Agreement. Except as expressly provided for above, the covenants, representations and warranties and agreements shall survive the consummation of the Merger. 11. Miscellaneous. (a) Specific Performance. Each party recognizes and agrees that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed by another party in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused to the other parties for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to any other available remedies, the other parties shall be entitled to an injunction restraining any violation or threatened violation of the provisions of this Agreement without the necessity of posting a bond or other form of security. In the event that any action should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party will allege, and each party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law. (b) Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to any provision of this Agreement, if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be excessive as to duration or scope, it is the parties' intention that such provision nevertheless be enforced to the fullest extent which it may be enforced. (c) Attorneys' Fees. If any action at law or equity, including an action for declaratory relief, is brought in respect of a breach or to enforce or any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses from the other party, which fees and expenses shall be in addition to any other relief which may be awarded. (d) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF. (e) Further Assurances. From time to time, at the request of Parent, each Securityholder shall execute and deliver to Parent or cause other Record Holders of the Company Common Stock Beneficially Owned by such Securityholder (other than Non-Voting Shares) to execute and deliver to Parent such additional instruments containing grants of proxy with respect to the Company Common Stock Beneficially Owned by such Securityholder (which grants of proxy will be in substantially the form of Section 2(c)(i) hereto) as Parent may reasonably request in connection with such Securityholder's obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 11(e) shall not apply to the extent that the applicable Securityholder is not able to comply herewith as a result of the arrangements set forth on Schedule II hereto. (f) Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof. (g) Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or, if such court will not accept jurisdiction, any court of competent civil jurisdiction sitting in Kent County, Delaware. In any action, suit or other proceeding, each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise any claims that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of the above courts, that such action or suit is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such action, suit or other proceeding is improper. Each of the parties hereto also agrees that any final and unappealable judgment against a party hereto in connection with any action, suit or other proceeding shall be conclusive and binding on such party and that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment. (h) The Securityholders' Representative. Each Securityholder hereby irrevocably appoints Gerald J. Ford (the "Securityholders' Representative") as such Securityholders' agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact to act in the name of and for and on behalf of such Securityholder in connection with all matters arising out of, resulting from, contemplated by or related or incident to this Agreement from and after the Effective Time. Parent shall have the absolute right and authority to rely upon the acts taken or omitted to be taken by the Securityholders' Representative on behalf of the Securityholders and Parent shall have no duty to inquire as to the acts and omissions of the Securityholders' Representative. Each Securityholder hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) all notices and deliveries by Parent or the Company to the Securityholders' Representative shall be deemed deliveries to the Securityholders, and (ii) any disclosure made to the Securityholders' Representative by or on behalf of Parent or the Company shall be deemed to be disclosure made to each Securityholder. In the event the Securityholders' Representative refuses to, or is no longer capable of, serving as the Securityholders' Representative hereunder, the Securityholders shall promptly appoint a successor Securityholders' Representative who shall thereafter be a successor Securityholders' Representative hereunder. (i) Resolution of Disagreements. If Parent and the Securityholders' Representative.... disagree as to the amount of Tax Benefits or any other item related to Taxes, Parent and the Securityholders' Representative shall promptly consult each other in an effort to resolve such disagreement. If any such disagreement cannot be resolved within fifteen days of the date of consultation, KPMG (the "Auditor") shall resolve any remaining disagreements as promptly as practicable (but in any event within forty-five days following the date on which such disagreement is referred to the Auditor), based solely on written submissions forwarded by Parent and the Securityholders' Representative to the Auditor within ten days of the date of referral to the Auditor. The determination of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. All fees and expenses related to the work performed by the Auditor in accordance with this Section 11(i) shall be apportioned between Parent and the Securityholders in proportion to their respective liabilities as determined by the Auditor.

Registrable Shares: means the Issuable Shares and any shares of Common Stock paid, issued or distributed in respect of such shares by way of stock dividends or distribution or stock split or in connection with a combination of shares, recapitalization, reorganization, merger or otherwise, until in the case of any such share (i) a Registration Statement covering such share has been declared effective under the Securities Act and such shares have been disposed of pursuant to such effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or (ii) such share may be transferred by a holder without registration pursuant to the Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any successor rule and Parent has agreed to remove the restrictive legend referred to in Section 5(f) of the Securityholders Agreement upon such sale.

(b) Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the SEC to declare each Shelf Registration effective (the date of initial effectiveness of a Shelf Registration being referred to herein as the "Effective Date") and to keep such Shelf Registration continuously effective and usable for the resale of Registrable Shares for a period ending on the earlier of (i) one year from its Effective Date and (ii) the first date on which all the Registrable Shares covered by such Shelf Registration have been sold (the "Effectiveness Period"). The foregoing notwithstanding, Parent shall have the right to suspend the use of each Shelf Registration for a reasonable length of time not to exceed 45 calendar days (a "Delay Period") and from time to time if the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel of Parent shall determine in good faith that such use (A) would require disclosure by Parent that would materially interfere with a material financing, merger, sale or acquisition of assets, recapitalization or other similar corporate action of Parent that is pending or expected by Parent to occur or be announced during the Delay Period or (B) would require pre-mature disclosure of non-public information the disclosure of which, in the good faith determination of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel of Parent, would be materially adverse to Parent or with respect to which Parent has a bona fide business purpose for keeping such information confidential; provided, that the aggregate number of days in all Delay Periods in respect of a Shelf Registration occurring in any period of twelve consecutive months shall not exceed 90 and a minimum of 5 Business Days shall elapse between successive Delay Periods. Parent shall provide written notice (to the extent practicable) no fewer than 5 Business Days prior to commencement of a Delay Period and promptly upon the end of any Delay Period to each holder of Registrable Shares covered by the applicable Shelf Registration and such holders shall cease all disposition efforts with respect to Registrable Shares held by them immediately upon the beginning of any Delay Period until notified of the end of such Delay Period (not to exceed 60 days). (c) Parent may, in its sole discretion, include other securities in such Shelf Registration (whether for the account of Parent or otherwise). SECTION 3 Hold-Back Agreement. Each holder of Registrable Shares agrees, if such holder is requested by an underwriter in an underwritten offering for Parent (whether for the account of Parent or otherwise), not to effect any public sale or distribution of any of Parent's equity securities including (only in the case of an offering for the account of Parent) a sale pursuant to Rule 144 (except as part of such underwritten registration), during the 3-day period prior to, and during the 90-day period beginning on, the closing date of such underwritten offering. In addition, each holder of Registrable Shares agrees, if such holder is requested by Parent, not to effect any public sale or distribution of any of Parent's equity securities pursuant to the Registration Statement, during the 3-day period prior to, and during the pendency of, any period during which an exchange ratio or similar valuation formula based upon the trading prices of the Common Stock is being calculated. SECTION 4. Registration Procedures. In connection with the registration obligations of Parent pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2 hereof (and subject to Parent's rights under Section 2), Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to effect such registration to permit the sale of such Registrable Shares in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto Parent shall as expeditiously as possible: (a) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments (including post-effective amendments) to the applicable Registration Statement, and such supplements to the applicable Prospectus, as may be required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder during the applicable period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the sellers thereof and cause the Prospectus as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act; (b) notify the selling holders of Registrable Shares promptly and (if requested by any such Person) confirm such notice in writing, (i) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with respect to a Shelf Registration or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (ii) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to such Shelf Registration or related Prospectus or for additional information regarding such holder, (iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of such Shelf Registration or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iv) of the receipt by Parent of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, and (v) of the happening of any event that requires the making of any changes in such Registration Statement so that it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (c) use reasonable best efforts to obtain the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of each Shelf Registration, or the prompt lifting of any suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Shares for sale in any jurisdiction in the United States; (d) if requested by the selling holders, furnish to counsel for the selling holders of Registrable Shares, without charge, one conformed copy of the applicable Shelf Registration as declared effective by the SEC and of each post-effective amendment thereto, in each case including financial statements and schedules and all exhibits and reports incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference; and such number of copies of the preliminary Prospectus, each amended preliminary Prospectus, each final Prospectus and each post-effective amendment or supplement thereto, as the selling holders may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Shares covered by the applicable Shelf Registration in conformity with the requirement of the Securities Act (Parent hereby consenting to such use of such documents); (e) except during any Delay Period, upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by paragraph 4(b)(ii) or 4(b)(v) above, promptly prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the applicable Shelf Registration or related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Shares being sold thereunder, such Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (f) cause all Registrable Shares covered by each Registration Statement to be listed on each U.S. securities exchange, if any, on which similar securities issued by Parent are then listed; and (g) Parent may require each seller of Registrable Shares as to which any registration is being effected to furnish such information regarding the distribution of such Registrable Shares and as to such seller as it may from time to time reasonably request. If any such information requested prior to the filing of the applicable Registration Statement with respect to any seller is not furnished prior to the filing of such Registration Statement, Parent may exclude such seller's Registrable Shares from such Shelf Registration. (h) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required for the sale of the Registrable Shares. Each holder of Registrable Shares agrees by inclusion of such Registrable Shares in the applicable Registration Statement that, upon receipt of any notice from Parent of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 4(b)(ii), 4(b)(iii), 4(b)(iv) or 4(b)(v) hereof or upon notice of the commencement of any Delay Period, such holder shall forthwith discontinue disposition of such Registrable Shares covered by such Registration Statement or Prospectus pursuant to such Registration Statement until such holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 4(e) hereof, or until it is advised in writing by Parent that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any amended or supplemented Prospectus or any additional or supplemental filings which are incorporated, or deemed to be incorporated, by reference in such Prospectus and, if requested by Parent, such holder shall deliver to Parent (at the expense of Parent) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such holder's possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Shares at the time of receipt of such request. Each holder of Registrable Shares further agrees not to utilize any material other than the applicable current Prospectus in connection with the offering of Registrable Shares pursuant to a Shelf Registration. SECTION 5. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) Parent will indemnify and hold harmless each holder of Registrable Securities, each Person, if any, who controls such holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the agents, employees, officers and directors of such holder and each such controlling Person, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such indemnified party may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or any action in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the applicable Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse such indemnified parties for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending against such loss, claim, damage or liability as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that Parent shall not be liable in any such case to the extent any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to Parent by such indemnified party specifically for use in the preparation thereof; provided, further, that Parent shall not be liable to any indemnified party hereunder with respect to the applicable Registration Statement or Prospectus to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such indemnified party results solely from an untrue statement of a material fact contained in, or the omission of a material fact from, the applicable Registration Statement or Prospectus which untrue statement or omission was corrected in an amended or supplemented Registration Statement or Prospectus, if the Person alleging such loss, claim, damage or liability was not sent or given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the amended or supplemented Registration Statement or Prospectus if Parent had previously furnished copies thereof to such indemnified party and such indemnified party was required under the Securities Act to deliver such amended or supplemented Registration Statement or Prospectus. (b) Each holder of Registrable Securities, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless Parent, each Person, if any, who controls Parent within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and the agents, employees, officers and directors of Parent and each such controlling Person against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which each such indemnified party may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from Parent, but only insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of or are based upon misstatements or alleged misstatements or omissions or alleged omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing by such holder to Parent specifically for use in the preparation of the applicable Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto). (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to any indemnified party except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it shall wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party. In the event the indemnifying party shall assume the defense thereof, any such indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (a) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (b) the named parties to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such indemnified party which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case, if such indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees and expense of more than one separate firm of attorneys (together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties). Any such fees and expenses payable by the indemnifying party shall be paid to the indemnified party entitled thereto as incurred by such indemnified party. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected without its written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action or proceeding, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each such indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (d) The obligations of Parent and the holders of Registrable Securities under this Section 5 shall be in addition to any liability that such Persons may otherwise have. SECTION 6. Registration Expenses. Except as provided below, whether or not any Registration Statement becomes effective, Parent shall pay all costs, fees and expenses incident to Parent's performance of or compliance with this Agreement including, without limitation, (i) SEC registration and filing fees, fees and expenses of compliance with securities or Blue Sky laws, (ii) fees and disbursements of counsel for Parent and (iii) fees and disbursements of all independent certified public accountants of Parent and all other Persons retained by Parent in connection with the Registration Statement. In all cases, the Major Shareholders will be responsible for underwriters discounts, selling commissions and fees and disbursements of counsel for all such Major Shareholders with respect to the Registrable Shares being sold by it and Parent will have no obligation to pay any such amounts. SECTION 7. Miscellaneous. 7.1 Termination. This Agreement and the obligations of Parent hereunder shall terminate on the earliest of (i) the first date on which no Registrable Shares remain outstanding, and (ii) the close of business on the last day of the final Effectiveness Period; provided that the foregoing Sections 5 and 6 of this agreement shall survive any such termination in accordance with their terms. 7.2 Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions herein may not be given, unless consent is obtained from the party against whom such waiver, modification or amendment is sought to be enforced (consent of the Major Shareholders means Parent has obtained the written consent of holders representing a majority of the Registrable Shares). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter which relates exclusively to the rights of holders of Registrable Shares whose securities are being sold pursuant to a Shelf Registration and that does not directly or indirectly affect the rights of a holder whose securities are not being sold pursuant to such Registration Statement may be given by holders of a majority of the Registrable Shares being sold by such holders; provided, however, that the provision of this sentence may not be amended, modified, or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence. 7.3 Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted herein shall be in writing and shall be deemed given: when delivered personally; one Business Day after being deposited with a next-day air courier; five Business Days after being deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; when answered back if telexed and when receipt is acknowledged, if telecopied, in each case to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice; provided that notices of a change of address shall be effective only upon receipt thereof); (i) if to a Major Shareholder, to the Securityholders' Representative (as defined in the Securityholders' Agreement) at the address set forth in the Securityholders Agreement; and (ii) if to Parent, to Parent and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, at their respective addresses as set forth in the Securityholders' Agreement. 7.4 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the parties; provided that without the written consent of Parent, the Major Shareholders may not assign their rights hereunder and no Person who acquires Registrable Shares from a Major Shareholder shall have any rights hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing and with no obligation on the part of Parent to amend a Registration Statement, a Major Shareholder's right under this Agreement may be assigned, in whole or in part, to any Permitted Transferee, and any Permitted Transferee shall be deemed to be a Major Shareholder; provided that no such assignment shall be effective or confer any right on any such assignee unless, prior to such assignment, the assignee agrees in writing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, that such assignee will be bound by all provisions binding on a Major Shareholder hereunder; provided, further, that any beneficiary of a pledge described in clause (iv) below shall not be required to agree in writing to be bound by the terms hereof unless and until such beneficiary shall request registration hereunder in respect of the Registrable Shares. A "Permitted Transferee" is (i) any affiliate (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of any Major Shareholder, (ii) any member of the family of a Major Shareholder, including such Major Shareholder's spouse and descendants and any trust, partnership, corporation, limited liability company or other entity for the benefit of such spouse and/or descendants to whom or which any Registrable Shares have been transferred by such Major Shareholder for estate or tax planning purposes, (iii) any charity or foundation to which Registrable Shares have been transferred by such Major Shareholder or person or entity described in clause (ii) above for estate or tax planning or charitable purposes, or (iv) the beneficiary of any bona fide pledge by any Major Shareholder of any Registrable Shares (including upon such beneficiary's request for registration hereunder in respect thereof); provided that such transferee agrees to be bound by the provisions hereof in accordance with the preceding sentence. Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and any Permitted Transferee any rights or remedies hereunder. 7.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 7.6 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. 7.7 Governing Law. Except to the extent superceded by Federal law, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state except for Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law. Each of the parties hereto agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement may be brought in the Courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in the Borough of Manhattan and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, each party hereto irrevocably submits itself in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts in any legal action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement brought in the courts referred to in the preceding sentence. Each party hereby consents to process being served in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of a copy thereof by registered U.S. mail, return receipt requested, to the address provided in Section 7.3 and agrees that such service upon receipt shall constitute good and sufficient service of process or notice thereof. Nothing in this Section 7.7 shall affect or eliminate any right to serve process in any other matter permitted by law. 7.8 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties hereto shall use their best efforts to find and employ and alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such term, provision, covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and declared to be the intention of the parties that they would have executed the remaining terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of such that may be hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable. 7.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement and a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein. There are no restrictions, promises, warranties or undertakings, other than those set forth or referred to herein, with respect to the registration rights granted by Parent with respect to the Registrable Shares. This Agreement supercedes all prior agreements and understandings between the parties with respect to such subject matter. 7.10 Calculation of Time Periods. Except as otherwise indicated, all periods of time referred to herein shall include all Saturdays, Sundays and holidays; provided, that if the date to perform the act or give any notice with respect to this Agreement shall fall on a day other than a Business Day, such act or notice may be timely performed or given if performed or given on the next succeeding Business Day. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above. CITIGROUP INC. By: -------------------------------- Name: Title: GSB INVESTMENTS CORP. By: ------------------------------- Name: Title: HUNTER'S GLEN/FORD, LTD. By: ------------------------------- Name: Title: 6 EXHIBIT B Escrow Provisions 1. Voting of Escrow Shares. For so long as any Escrow Shares (or any additional securities issued with respect thereto) are held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Securityholders Agreement, each Major Shareholder shall have the absolute right to have that portion of the Escrow Shares allocated to such Major Shareholder's subaccount (and any additional securities issued with respect thereto) voted on all matters with respect to which the vote of the holders of Parent Common Stock is required or solicited in accordance with the written instructions of such Major Shareholder at the time of the applicable record date as given to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall promptly forward to the Securityholders' Representative copies of all proxy solicitation material received with respect to the Escrow Shares. The right of a Major Shareholder to instruct the Escrow Agent to vote any portion of the Escrow Shares shall be determined as of the record date established by Parent with respect to such vote. If no written instructions are timely received by the Escrow Agent from a Major Shareholder, then the Escrow Agent shall not vote any of the shares in the Escrow Fund with respect to which such Major Shareholder owns a right. 2. Dividends on Escrow Shares. (a) For so long as any of the Escrow Shares (or any additional securities with respect thereto) are held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Securityholders Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, each Major Shareholder shall have the absolute right to all dividends and distributions (of whatever nature) on that portion of the Escrow Shares allocated to such Major Shareholder's subaccount (and any additional securities with respect thereto, and any interest or earnings upon such dividends, distributions or additional securities). The Escrow Agent shall deliver to each Major Shareholder such Major Shareholder's portion of such amounts or securities paid or issued in respect of Escrow Shares within 10 days of receiving such dividends. (b) Upon execution of the Escrow Agreement, each party shall provide the Escrow Agent with a fully executed W-8 or W-9 Internal Revenue Service form, which shall include their Tax Identification Number (TIN) as assigned by the Internal Revenue Service. All interest or other income earned under the Escrow Agreement shall be allocated and paid as provided herein and reported by the recipient to the Internal Revenue Service as having been so allocated and paid. 3. Escrow Agent's Responsibility. (a) The Escrow Agent's sole responsibility shall be for the safekeeping of the Escrow fund, the establishment and maintenance of subaccounts, and the disbursement thereof, and the Escrow Agent shall not be required to take any other action with reference to any matters which might arise in connection with the Escrow fund, the Escrow Agreement or the Securityholders Agreement. The Escrow Agent may act upon any written instruction or other instrument which the Escrow Agent in good faith believes to be genuine and to be signed and sent by the Securityholders' Representative and the proper officers of Parent. The Escrow Agent shall not be required to take any action until such time as it has received written instructions as provided above and any tax or other information or documents reasonably requested by it. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by it in good faith and believed to be authorized or within the rights or powers conferred upon it by the Escrow Agreement or for anything which the Escrow Agent may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith unless the Escrow Agent is guilty of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Escrow Agent may from time to time consult with legal counsel of its own choice for advice concerning its obligations under the Escrow Agreement, and it shall have full and complete authorization and protection for any action taken or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of such counsel. The Escrow Agent has no duty to determine or inquire into the occurrence of any event or the performance or failure of performance of any of the parties hereto with respect to any agreements or arrangements with each other or with any other party or parties. (b) The duties and obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent's duties and obligations are purely ministerial in nature, and nothing herein shall be construed to give rise to any fiduciary obligations of the Escrow Agent. In the event of any disagreement or the representation of any adverse claim or demand in connection with the disbursement of the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall, at its option, be entitled to refuse to comply with any such claims or demands during the continuance of such disagreement and may refrain from delivering any items affected thereby, and in so doing, the Escrow Agent shall not become liable to the parties or to any other person, due to its failure to comply with such adverse claim or demand. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to continue, without liability, to refrain and refuse to act: (i) until authorized to disburse by a court order from a court having jurisdiction of the parties and the Escrow Fund, after which time the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in conformity with such adjudication; or (ii) until all differences shall have been adjusted by agreement and the Escrow Agent shall have been notified thereof and shall have been directed in writing, signed jointly or in counterpart by the undersigned and by all persons making adverse claims or demands, at which time the Escrow Agent shall be protected in acting in compliance therewith. (c) The Escrow Agent shall treat all communications pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, whether oral or written, confidentially and shall not make any public disclosure of communications to or from any party hereto. In the event that the Escrow Agent is requested in any legal proceeding to disclose any communications, the Escrow Agent shall give prompt notice to the Securityholders' Representative and Parent of such request so that such Securityholders' Representative or Parent may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy. (d) Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement without further act. (e) In the event that the Escrow Agent is unable to perform its obligations under the terms of the Escrow Agreement because of acts of God, strikes, equipment or transmission failure or damage reasonably beyond its control, or other cause reasonably beyond its control, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for damages to the other parties hereto for any unforeseeable damages resulting from such failure to perform or otherwise from such causes. Performance by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement shall resume when the Escrow Agent is able to perform substantially its duties. 4. Indemnification of Escrow Agent. (a) The Major Shareholders agree to indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent and its officers and employees harmless for and from all claims, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in connection with its acting as Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement ("Expenses"), except in those instances where the Escrow Agent has been guilty of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. In addition, the Major Shareholders agree to pay to the Escrow Agent its reasonable fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel in connection with entering into the Escrow Agreement) in connection with the performance of its duties under the Escrow Agreement ("Fees"). Under no circumstances shall the Escrow Agent (i) be entitled to charge the Escrow Fund for any amounts due to the Escrow Agent from the Major Shareholders or (ii) have any rights against Parent as a third party beneficiary or otherwise pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. If the Major Shareholders are required to pay any Expenses or Fees to the Escrow Agent under this section, Parent shall reimburse the Major Shareholders, within two business days after payment has been made and reimbursement requested, one-half of the amount the Major Shareholders paid to the Escrow Agent pursuant hereto in respect of Expenses or Fees. The provisions of this section shall survive the termination of the Escrow Agreement. (b) Anything in the Escrow Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood for such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. The parties hereto acknowledge that the foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination of the Escrow Agreement. 5. Settlement of Disputes Regarding Ownership. Any dispute which may arise under this Agreement with respect to the delivery and/or ownership or right of possession of the Escrow Shares, or the duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder, shall be settled either by mutual agreement of the parties concerned (evidenced by appropriate instructions in writing to the Escrow Agent, signed by the parties), by a final order, decree or judgment of any appropriate court located in the State of New York (the time for appeal having expired and no appeal having been perfected), or by a certified copy of an arbitration award binding upon the parties other than the Escrow Agent, each party or parties bearing its own costs and expenses with respect to the dispute; provided, however, that all MFI Determinations and HG/F Determinations (collectively, "Determinations") shall be made only as provided in the Securityholders Agreement and neither the Parent nor the Securityholders' Representative have the right to dispute any claim which has been the subject of a Determination. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty whatsoever to institute or defend any such proceedings. Prior to the settlement of any such dispute, the Escrow Agent is authorized and directed to retain in its possession, without liability to anyone, the Escrow Shares applicable to such dispute. The Escrow Agent shall deliver the appropriate number of Escrow Shares as provided in any settlement among the parties. 6. Resignation; Removal. (a) The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving 30 days' prior written notice of such resignation to Parent and the Shareholders' Representative, specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect; provided that no such resignation shall be effective until a successor Escrow Agent shall have been appointed and shall have accepted its appointment in writing as hereinafter set forth. Upon such notice, the Securityholders' Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Escrow Agent reasonably acceptable to Parent. If the Securityholders' Representative fails to appoint a successor Escrow Agent within 30 days after such notice or such appointed Escrow Agent has not accepted such appointment in writing within such 30 day period, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to appoint its successor, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof that has a combined capital and surplus of at least $1 billion. (b) Any successor Escrow Agent (whether succeeding a resigning or removed Escrow Agent) shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the resigning Escrow Agent, Parent and the Securityholders' Representative, and immediately thereafter, (i) the resigning Escrow Agent shall transfer and deliver the Escrow Fund to the successive Escrow Agent, whereupon the resignation of the resigning Escrow Agent shall become effective, and (ii) the successor Escrow Agent shall constitute the "Escrow Agent" for all purposes hereunder and all applicable provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the successor Escrow Agent as though it had been named herein. Any such resignation shall not relieve the resigning Escrow Agent from any liability incurred by it hereunder prior to such resignation becoming effective. (c) The Escrow Agent shall continue to serve until its successor accepts the duties of Escrow Agent hereunder. Parent and the Shareholders' Representative may agree at any time to remove the Escrow Agent and substitute a new Escrow Agent by giving 30 days' notice thereof to the then acting Escrow Agent. Any successor Escrow Agent appointed as provided herein must be qualified to act as an escrow agent under applicable law. 7. Fund Transfer Instructions. (a) In the event fund transfer instructions are given (other than in writing at the time of the execution of this Agreement), whether in writing, by telecopier or otherwise the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on the call-back schedule to be attached to the Escrow Agreement, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmations of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent and only by the applicable party to the Escrow Agreement. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that such security procedure is commercially reasonable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) funds may be transferred only to a party to the Escrow Agreement or to such other person designated as may be designated by the applicable party pursuant to the preceding subsection and (y) only the funds allocated to the applicable party may be transferred to such party or to such party's properly designated beneficiary. (b) It is understood that the Escrow Agent and the beneficiary's bank in any fund transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying number provided by either of the parties hereto to identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiary's bank, or (iii) an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds for any payment order it executes using such identifying number, even where its use may result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiary's bank, or an intermediary bank designated.
