Citigroup Inc. Current Report on Form 8-K Item 5. Other Events. On June 26, 2002, in light of WorldCom's announcement concerning the restatement of its earnings, Citigroup's Chief Financial Officer Todd Thomson outlined Citigroup's exposure to WorldCom as follows: * In the Corporate & Investment Bank, we expect our net credit losses to be negligible. We expect modest losses arising out of our role as market maker and other positions in WorldCom publicly-traded securities. * Through our insurance companies' $70 billion fixed income portfolio, we estimate the face value exposure to various WorldCom bonds to be approximately $85 million at Travelers Property Casualty and about $250 million at our life and annuity companies. * In addition, we estimate $40 million in possible exposure in other areas throughout Citigroup. "While we are currently assessing the level of impairment on these securities, we expect that the financial impact to Citigroup should be relatively modest," said Thomson. # # # Forward-Looking Statements Certain of the statements contained herein that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.
