If this table were prepared on a managed basis, which includes certain effects of securitization activities including receivables held for securitization and receivables sold with servicing retained, there would be no impact to net income, but revenues, net of interest expense, and benefits, claims, and credit losses would have been increased by $3.568 billion, $2.459 billion, $2.707 billion, $2.364 billion and $1.734 billion in 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Although a managed basis presentation is not in conformity with GAAP, it provides a representation of the volumes in the credit card business. (3) On August 20, 2002, Citigroup completed the distribution to its stockholders of a majority portion of its remaining ownership interest in Travelers Property Casualty (TPC). Following the distribution, Citigroup began accounting for TPC as discontinued operations.

CITIGROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC) (an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup on December 31, 2001) sold 231 million shares of its class A common stock representing approximately 23.1% of its outstanding equity securities in an initial public offering (the IPO) on March 27, 2002. Citigroup recognized an after-tax gain of $1.061 billion in the 2002 first quarter as a result of the IPO. The after-tax gain was increased by $97 million in the 2002 third quarter due to the receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and the resolution of certain tax matters related to the IPO. In connection with the IPO, Citigroup entered into an agreement with TPC that provides that, in any fiscal year in which TPC records asbestos-related income statement charges in excess of $150 million, net of any reinsurance, Citigroup will pay to TPC the amount of any such excess up to a cumulative aggregate of $800 million, reduced by the tax effect of the highest applicable federal income tax rate. A portion of the gross IPO gain was deferred to offset any payments arising in connection with this agreement. On October 16, 2002, notice was given that $159 million will be payable in the 2002 fourth quarter, pursuant to this agreement. On August 20, 2002, Citigroup completed the distribution to its stockholders of a majority portion of its remaining ownership interest in TPC (the distribution). This non-cash distribution was tax-free to Citigroup, its stockholders and TPC. The distribution was treated as a dividend to stockholders for accounting purposes that reduced Citigroup's Additional Paid-In Capital by approximately $6.9 billion. Following the distribution, Citigroup remains a holder of approximately 9.9% of TPC's outstanding equity securities which will be carried at fair value in the Proprietary Investment Activities segment and classified as available-for-sale within Investments on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Following the August 20, 2002 distribution, the results of TPC are reported in the Company's Statements of Income and Cash Flows separately as discontinued operations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Statement of Consolidated Financial Position has not been restated. TPC represented the primary vehicle by which Citigroup engaged in the property and casualty insurance business. TPC primarily includes the results of its Personal Lines and Commercial Lines businesses. The Personal Lines business of TPC primarily provides coverage on personal automobile and homeowners insurance sold to individuals, which are distributed through approximately 7,600 independent agencies located throughout the United States.

SELECTED REVENUE ITEMS Net interest revenue as calculated from the Consolidated Statement of Income was $32.7 billion in 2001, up $6.4 billion or 24% from 2000, which was up $1.9 billion or 8% from 1999 reflecting business volume growth in most markets and the impact of acquisitions. Total commissions, asset management and administration fees, and other fee revenues of $21.0 billion were down $331 million or 2% in 2001 primarily reflecting decreases in over-the-counter securities and mutual fund commissions due to depressed market conditions, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Insurance premiums of $3.5 billion in 2001 were up $214 million or 7% from year-ago levels and down $231 million or 7% in 2000. Principal transactions revenues decreased in 2001 to $5.5 billion, from $6.0 billion in 2000 and $5.2 billion in 1999 reflecting results in GCIB. Realized gains from sales of investments of $237 million in 2001 were down from $760 million in 2000, but were up from $429 million in 1999. The increase in 2000 resulted from gains on the exchange of certain Latin American bonds, partially offset by losses in insurance-related investments. Other revenue of $4.5 billion in 2001 decreased $1.5 billion from 2000, which was up $1.9 billion from 1999. The 2001 decrease primarily reflected venture capital activity. OPERATING EXPENSES Operating expenses, which include restructuring- and merger-related items, grew $719 million or 2% to $36.5 billion in 2001, and increased $4.8 billion or 15% from 1999 to 2000. GCIB expenses were essentially flat to 2000 as the increases in CAPITAL MARKETS AND BANKING and TRANSACTION SERVICES, as a result of acquisitions, and other volume-related increases, was offset by a decrease in PRIVATE CLIENT as a result of lower compensation and benefits and the impact of expense control initiatives. Expenses increased in Global Consumer by 6% in 2001 and 9% in 2000 reflecting higher business volumes including acquisitions, partially offset in 2001 by savings resulting from the integration of Associates. Global Investment Management expenses increased 5% in 2001 and 21% in 2000, driven by acquisitions in 2001 and investments in sales and marketing activities, technology, and product development in both years. HOUSING FINANCE UNIT CHARGE Included in other operating expenses for 2000 is a $71 million (after-tax) charge associated with the discontinuation of the loan origination operations of the Associates Housing Finance unit. BENEFITS, CLAIMS AND CREDIT LOSSES Benefits, claims and credit losses were $10.3 billion in 2001, up $1.9 billion or 22% from 2000, which was up $953 million or 13% from 1999. Policyholder benefits and claims increased 13% to $3.5 billion in 2001 and 14% to $3.1 billion in 2000 primarily as a result of increased volume in LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES. The provision for credit losses increased 27% to $6.8 billion in 2001 and 12% to $5.3 billion in 2000. Global Consumer provision for benefits, claims and credit losses of $6.1 billion were up 20% in 2001 and 7% in 2000.

The consumer loan delinquency ratio (90 days or more past due) was 2.75% at the end of 2001, up from 1.83% and 2.09% at the end of 2000 and 1999. GCIB benefits, claims and credit losses increased to $1.5 billion from $947 million in 2000, which was up from $542 million in 1999, resulting from increases in CAPITAL MARKETS AND BANKING of $452 million offset by a decrease in TRANSACTION SERVICES of $47 million. Corporate cash-basis loans at December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $3.5 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. The increase in cash-basis loans was primarily related to the acquisition of Banamex, the transportation portfolio, and increases attributable to borrowers in the retail, telecommunication, energy and utility industries. CAPITAL Total capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) was $75.8 billion or 10.92% of risk-adjusted assets, and Tier 1 capital was $58.4 billion or 8.42% at December 31, 2001, compared to $73.0 billion or 11.23% and $54.5 billion or 8.38% at December 31, 2000.

CARDS - which includes bankcards, private-label cards and charge cards - reported net income of $2.536 billion in 2001, up $357 million or 16% from 2000, driven by growth in Citi Cards, prior-year restructuring-related items and the acquisition of Banamex in August 2001, partially offset by declines resulting from economic conditions in Argentina. Net income in 2000 was up $515 million or 31%, led by growth in Citi Cards, Asia and Latin America, which experienced increased earnings in Credicard, a 33%-owned Brazilian Card affiliate. As shown in the following table, average managed loans grew 10% in 2001, mainly reflecting growth in Citi Cards and Mexico, which included the effect of the Banamex acquisition. In the international markets, receivable growth in Asia was partially offset by credit risk management initiatives and the negative impact of foreign currency translation in Latin America and the prior-year sale of Diners Club franchises in Western Europe. Sales were unchanged in 2001 as the negative impact of the events of September 11th and the sale of Diners Club franchises in Western Europe were partially offset by the addition of Banamex. Increases in 2000 were mainly due to portfolio acquisitions in Citi Cards. (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. Revenues, net of interest expense, of $12.054 billion in 2001 increased $1.351 billion or 13% from 2000, primarily reflecting spread improvement due to lower cost of funds and repricing actions, combined with the benefit of receivable growth and the acquisition of Banamex. These increases were partially offset by estimated translation losses of $111 million associated with the re-denomination of certain consumer loans in Argentina as well as the impact of the Diners Club sale in Western Europe. Revenues of $10.703 billion in 2000 increased $1.584 billion or 17% from 1999 primarily reflecting the benefit of receivable growth and higher interchange fee revenues in Citi Cards combined with the impact of the Diners Club acquisition in Japan. Operating expenses of $5.499 billion in 2001 increased $156 million or 3% from 2000 as volume-related increases and the addition of Banamex were partially offset by disciplined expense management across all regions and the Diners Club sale in Western Europe. Operating expenses in 2001 included net restructuring-related charges 7
of $16 million ($11 million after-tax), including a charge related to the acquisition of Banamex that was partially offset by a release in Citi Cards resulting from changes in estimates, compared to restructuring-related charges of $96 million ($60 million after-tax) in 2000, mainly reflecting actions in Citi Cards. In 2000, operating expenses of $5.343 billion grew $622 million or 13% from 1999, primarily due to increases in Citi Cards, related to acquisitions, increased target-marketing efforts and restructuring-related charges, and in Japan, resulting from the acquisition of Diners Club. The provision for credit losses in 2001 was $2.596 billion compared to $1.951 billion in 2000 and $1.755 billion in 1999. Net credit losses in 2001 were $2.596 billion with a related loss ratio of 5.63%, compared to $1.956 billion and 4.32% in 2000 and $1.709 billion and 4.65% in 1999. The increase in the net credit loss ratio in 2001 primarily reflected increases in Citi Cards which reflect current U.S. economic conditions including a rise in bankruptcy filings. Loans delinquent 90 days or more were $1.006 billion or 2.10% of loans at December 31, 2001, compared to $569 million or 1.15% at December 31, 2000 and $623 million or 1.61% at December 31, 1999. The securitization of credit card receivables is limited to the Citi Cards business within North America. At December 31, 2001, securitized credit card receivables were $67.0 billion, compared to $57.2 billion at December 31, 2000 and $55.6 billion at December 31, 1999. Credit card receivables held-for-sale were $6.5 billion at December 31, 2001, compared to $8.1 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Because securitization changes Citigroup's role from that of a lender to that of a loan servicer, it removes the receivables from Citigroup's balance sheet and affects the manner in which revenue and the provision for credit losses are classified in the income statement. For securitized receivables and receivables held-for-sale, amounts that would otherwise be reported as net interest revenue, fee and commission revenue, and credit losses on loans are instead reported as fee and commission revenue (for servicing fees) and other revenue (for the remaining revenue, net of credit losses). Because credit losses are a component of these cash flows, revenues over the terms of these transactions may vary depending upon the credit performance of the securitized receivables. However, Citigroup's exposure to credit losses on the securitized receivables is contractually limited to the cash flows from the receivables. Including securitized receivables and receivables held-for-sale, net credit losses would have been $6.051 billion in 2001 with a related loss ratio of 5.28% compared to $4.367 billion and 4.21% in 2000 and $4.416 billion and 4.88% in 1999. Adjusting for securitization activity, loans delinquent 90 days or more would have been $2.384 billion or 1.96% at December 31, 2001, compared to $1.671 billion or 1.46% at December 31, 2000 and $1.531 billion or 1.59% at December 31, 1999. CONSUMER FINANCE (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. CONSUMER FINANCE - which provides community-based lending services through branch networks, regional sales offices and cross-selling initiatives with other Citigroup businesses - reported net income of $1.905 billion in 2001, up $540 million or 40% from 2000, primarily reflecting strong growth in North America and Japan. The growth in North America was primarily due to growth in receivables, efficiencies resulting from the integration of Associates and lower cost of funds. The growth in Japan mainly reflected growth in loans and the acquisition of Unimat in September 2000. Net income of $1.365 billion in 2000 grew $181 million or 15% from 1999 primarily reflecting growth in International Consumer Finance of $176 million or 42% due to increases in Japan and Western Europe, partially offset by a decline in Latin America. As shown in the following table, average loans grew 15% in 2001 and 16% in 2000 resulting from higher volumes from CitiFinancial locations, the cross-selling of products through Primerica and, in 2000, the impact of acquisitions in the U.S. and Japan. At December 31, 2001, the portfolio consisted of 62% real estate-secured loans, compared with 61% at December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999. As shown in the following table, the average net interest margin of 10.86% in 2001 increased 40 basis points from 2000 as lower cost of funds was partially offset by continued growth in lower-risk real estate loans that have lower yields. In North America, the average net interest margin was 8.19% in 2001, increasing 18 basis points from the prior year as the benefit of lower cost of funds was partially offset by lower yields, both reflecting a lower interest rate environment. The average net interest margin for International Consumer Finance was 22.13% in 2001, up 47 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in yields that was partially offset by higher cost of funds. The average net interest margin of 10.46% in 2000 increased 8 basis points from 1999, as higher yields in International Consumer Finance were partially offset by higher cost of funds and lower yields in the U.S. Revenues, net of interest expense, of $8.838 billion in 2001 increased $1.134 billion or 15% from 2000. The increase in revenue reflected growth of 25% in International Consumer Finance and 10% in North America. Revenue growth in North America was primarily driven by strong growth in receivables and lower cost of funds which was partially offset by lower yields, mainly due to a lower interest rate environment. In International Consumer Finance, revenue growth in Japan and Western Europe was partially offset by a decline in Latin America. Revenue growth in Japan was primarily driven by increased receivables, including the addition of Unimat, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and reduced spreads. Revenue growth in Western Europe reflected higher volumes and spreads, partially offset by the effect of foreign currency translation. The decline in Latin America was primarily due to estimated translation losses of $62 million associated with the re-denomination of certain consumer 8
loans in Argentina. Revenues of $7.704 billion in 2000 increased $1.103 billion or 17% from 1999 reflecting the benefit of receivable growth in North America and Japan, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation in Japan. Operating expenses of $3.336 billion in 2001 decreased $110 million or 3% from 2000 reflecting benefits from the integration of Associates in the U.S., as well as higher restructuring-related charges in 2000, partially offset by increased expenses in Japan resulting from costs associated with expansion efforts including the impact of acquisitions and higher business volumes. Expenses of $3.446 billion in 2000 increased $615 million or 22% from 1999 reflecting higher business volumes, including the effects of acquisitions, and restructuring-related charges. Operating expenses included restructuring-related charges of $34 million ($20 million after-tax) in 2001, $108 million ($70 million after-tax) in 2000 and $10 million ($7 million after-tax) in 1999. Restructuring-related charges were mainly due to actions in the U.S. in 2001 and 2000 and in Latin America in 1999. The provisions for benefits, claims, and credit losses were $2.499 billion in 2001, up from $2.127 billion in 2000 and $1.880 billion in 1999, primarily reflecting increases in the U.S. and Japan. Net credit losses and the related loss ratio were $2.213 billion and 3.10% in 2001, up from $1.845 billion and 2.96% in 2000 and $1.605 billion and 2.99% in 1999. In North America, net credit losses were $1.527 billion and the related loss ratio was 2.65% in 2001, compared to $1.339 billion and 2.61% in 2000, and $1.224 billion and 2.71% in 1999. Net credit losses in the U.S. in 2001 included losses of $76 million from sales of certain under-performing loans, which were charged against the allowance for credit losses and resulted in a 13 basis point increase to the net credit loss ratio in North America. Net credit losses in International Consumer Finance were $686 million and the related loss ratio was 5.01% in 2001, up from $506 million and 4.58% in 2000 and $381 million and 4.48% in 1999. The increases in net credit losses in 2001 and 2000 reflected increases in Japan that were primarily due to higher loan volumes, including the impact of acquisitions, and, in 2001, increased bankruptcy filings and deteriorating credit quality. Loans delinquent 90 days or more were $2.243 billion or 3.04% of loans at December 31, 2001, compared to $1.435 billion or 2.15% at December 31, 2000 and $1.131 billion or 1.94% at December 31, 1999. The increase in delinquencies in 2001 was primarily due to the alignment of credit and collection policies in the Associates real estate portfolio in the U.S. to those at CitiFinancial. Net credit losses and the related ratio may increase from 2001 as a result of continued increases in bankruptcy filings and unemployment rates in the U.S. and Japan. This is a forward-looking statement within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. See "Forward-Looking Statements" on page 17. RETAIL BANKING (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. RETAIL BANKING -- which delivers banking, lending, investment and insurance services to customers through retail branches, electronic delivery systems and the network of Primerica independent agents -- reported net income of $2.508 billion in 2001, up $551 million or 28% from 2000. The increase in RETAIL BANKING reflected growth in both North America and International Retail Banking of $452 million or 42% and $99 million or 11%, respectively. Growth in North America was primarily due to the acquisitions of Banamex and European American Bank (EAB). Growth in International Retail Banking reflected increases in all regions except Latin America. Net income of $1.957 billion in 2000 grew $298 million or 18% from 1999, primarily reflecting a $256 million or 41% increase in International Retail Banking, which was driven by growth in Asia of $133 million or 64%. In July 2001, Citibanking North America completed the acquisition of EAB, a state-chartered bank that added $8.4 billion to end-of-period deposits, $4.4 billion to end-of-period loans and 78 branches at December 31, 2001. In August 2001, Citicorp completed its acquisition of Banamex. Subsequently, Citibank Mexico's banking operations merged into Banamex, with Banamex being the surviving entity. The business also successfully merged the Citibank branches onto the Banamex operating platform without customer disruption. Both acquisitions were accounted for as purchases, therefore, the results of Banamex and EAB are included in the RETAIL BANKING results from the dates of acquisition. As shown in the following table, RETAIL BANKING grew customer deposits and average loans in 2001. The growth in North America in 2001 primarily reflected the acquisitions of Banamex and EAB, which added $10.0 billion and $4.0 billion to average customer deposits and $0.4 billion and $2.3 billion to average loans, respectively. In addition, North America experienced customer deposit growth in Citibanking North America and average loan growth in Consumer Assets, primarily due to increased student loans and mortgage loans held for sale. The growth in International Retail Banking average loans in 2001 reflected growth in Western Europe, Japan and Asia, partially offset by a decline in Latin America which resulted from continued credit risk management initiatives and foreign currency translation effects. Average customer deposits in the international markets increased 8% in 2001 as growth in all regions was offset by a decline in Latin America which reflected continued weak economic conditions in Argentina and foreign currency translation effects. Growth in average customer deposits in 2000 was driven by increases in Asia, Citibanking North America and Japan. Growth in average loans in 2000 was mainly due to growth in Consumer Assets, which experienced increases in variable rate mortgage loans, that are typically held in the portfolio rather than securitized, and in student loans. 9
(1) Includes loans held for sale. Revenues, net of interest expense, of $11.281 billion in 2001 increased $1.585 billion or 16% from 2000. Revenues in North America grew $1.481 billion or 27%, driven by the acquisitions of Banamex and EAB and growth in Citibanking North America and Consumer Assets. Excluding the addition of Banamex and EAB, growth in Citibanking North America reflected the benefit of strong customer deposit growth and increased debit card fees along with a realized investment gain resulting from the disposition of an equity investment. Citibanking North America revenue growth in 2001 was partially offset by reduced investment product fees reflecting market conditions throughout the year. Revenue growth in Consumer Assets was mainly due to higher mortgage securitization income and spread improvement in student loans, partially offset by lower servicing revenue. The decline in servicing revenue primarily reflected increased prepayment activity that was driven by lower interest rates. International Retail Banking revenues increased $104 million or 2% as growth in Asia and CEEMEA was partially offset by a decline in Latin America. Growth in Asia was mainly due to increases in deposits and investment product fees while the increase in CEEMEA mainly reflected the acquisition of a majority interest in Bank Handlowy in Poland in June 2000 and the acquisition of ING's retail branches in Hungary in August 2000. The decline in Latin America was mainly due to estimated translation losses of $62 million associated with the re-denomination of certain consumer loans in Argentina. Revenues of $9.696 billion in 2000 grew $483 million or 5% from 1999 reflecting increases in North America and International Retail Banking. The increase in North America mainly reflected growth in Citibanking North America, Primerica and Consumer Assets, partially offset by a decline in Mexico due to the loss of a subsidy from the Mexican government related to Confia. The increase in International Retail Banking reflected growth in Asia, Japan and CEEMEA partially offset by a decline in Western Europe that was mainly driven by the negative impact of foreign currency translation. Operating expenses of $6.300 billion in 2001 increased $715 million or 13% from 2000 as increases in North America were partially offset by declines in International Retail Banking. The growth in North America was primarily due to the acquisitions of EAB and Banamex, higher restructuring-related charges, increased advertising and marketing costs and other volume-related increases. The declines in International Retail Banking mainly reflected the impact of foreign currency translation and expense rationalization initiatives across the regions partially offset by the effects of higher business volumes and acquisitions. Operating expenses in 2000 were up $242 million or 5% compared to 1999 primarily reflecting the impact of increased business volumes, charges related to the termination of certain contracts and other e-Consumer related initiatives in Citibanking North America, Confia systems consolidation costs in Mexico, and the impact of acquisitions in CEEMEA. Operating expenses included restructuring-related charges of $128 million ($83 million after-tax) in 2001, $22 million ($16 million after-tax) in 2000 and $59 million ($38 million after-tax) in 1999. The provisions for benefits, claims, and credit losses were $1.061 billion in 2001, up from $980 million in 2000 and down from $1.188 billion in 1999. The increase in the provisions for benefits, claims, and credit losses in 2001 was mainly due to the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a decline in Asia. The decrease in the provisions in 2000 compared to 1999 was mainly due to improvements in the quality of the loan portfolios in Consumer Assets and Citibanking North America, the impact of the first quarter 2000 auto loan portfolio sale in Puerto Rico and higher write-offs in Argentina in 1999. Net credit losses were $636 million and the related loss ratio was 0.65% in 2001, compared to $618 million and 0.76% in the 2000 and $677 million and 0.90% in 1999. The increase in net credit losses from the prior year was mainly due to the acquisitions of Banamex and EAB. Loans delinquent 90 days or more were $3.437 billion or 3.30% of loans at December 31, 2001, compared to $2.124 billion or 2.37% at December 31, 2000 and $2.223 billion or 2.82% in 1999. The increase in delinquent loans in 2001 was mainly due to the acquisitions of Banamex and EAB, as well as increases in Consumer Assets and Latin America, primarily in Argentina. The increase in Consumer Assets mainly reflected a higher level of buy backs from GNMA pools where credit risk is maintained by government agencies. Net credit losses and the related ratio are expected to increase from 2001 due to the inclusion of a full year's credit losses for Banamex and EAB as well as future credit performance of the portfolios, economic conditions and statutory changes in the regions. This is a forward-looking statement within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. See "Forward-Looking Statements" on page 17. Average assets of $139 billion in 2001 increased $29 billion from 2000, which, in turn, increased $5 billion from 1999. The increase in 2001 primarily reflected the acquisitions of Banamex and EAB combined with loan growth in Consumer Assets. OTHER CONSUMER (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. OTHER CONSUMER - which includes certain treasury and other unallocated staff functions, global marketing and other programs -- reported losses of $113 million and $91 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, compared to net income of $18 million in 1999. The increase in losses from 2000 was primarily due to lower treasury results and lower foreign currency hedge gains. Income in 1999 was primarily due to gains resulting from the disposition of the Associates recreational vehicle finance operations (Fleetwood Credit Corporation) and the sale of certain non-strategic operations. Operating expenses included a restructuring-related charge of $20 million ($13 million after-tax) in 2001, a restructuring-related credit of $3 million ($2 million after-tax) in 2000 and a restructuring-related charge of $53 million ($34 million after-tax) in 1999. Revenues, expenses, and the provision for benefits, claims and credit losses reflect offsets to certain line-item reclassifications reported in other Global Consumer operating segments. The 1999 revenues, 10
expenses, and provision for benefits, claims and credit losses also include the results of certain private label cards and other businesses that were discontinued in 1999 and 2000. GLOBAL CORPORATE AND INVESTMENT BANK (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. THE GLOBAL CORPORATE AND INVESTMENT BANK (GCIB) serves corporations, financial institutions, governments, investors and other participants in capital markets throughout the world and consists of CAPITAL MARKETS AND BANKING, PRIVATE CLIENT, and TRANSACTION SERVICES. The primary businesses in CAPITAL MARKETS AND BANKING include Fixed Income, Equities, Investment Banking, Sales & Trading (which mainly operates in Asia, Latin America, CEEMEA and Mexico), CitiCapital and Lending. On June 7, 2000, GCIB completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Bank Handlowy, a leading bank in Poland. On May 1, 2000, GCIB completed the acquisition of the global investment banking business and related net assets of Schroders PLC (Schroders), including all corporate finance, financial markets and securities activities. During the second quarter of 2000, GCIB strengthened its position in the U.S. leasing market through the purchase of Copelco. GCIB reported net income of $5.113 billion in 2001, up $42 million or 1% from 2000, which, in turn, was up $617 million or 14% from 1999. The increase in 2001 net income reflects an increase of $320 million or 9% in CAPITAL MARKETS AND BANKING and $81 million in Other Corporate, partially offset by declines of $301 million or 28% in PRIVATE CLIENT and $58 million or 12% in TRANSACTION SERVICES. The increase in 2000 net income reflects an increase of $292 million in TRANSACTION SERVICES, $233 million or 7% in CAPITAL MARKETS AND BANKING and $154 million or 17% in PRIVATE CLIENT, partially offset by a decline of $62 million in Other Corporate. The increase in CAPITAL MARKETS AND BANKING 2001 net income compared to 2000 was primarily due to strong growth in Fixed Income, Sales & Trading and gains on asset sales in CitiCapital, partially offset by weakness in Equities, lower earnings from the investment in Nikko Cordial, a higher provision for credit losses and restructuring-related charges of $121 million (after-tax) in 2001. CAPITAL MARKETS AND BANKING net income of $3.567 billion in 2000 increased $233 million or 7% compared to 1999 primarily reflecting higher Equities, higher earnings from the investment in Nikko Cordial and the acquisitions of Schroders and Bank Handlowy, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and lower Fixed Income. The decrease in PRIVATE CLIENT 2001 net income compared to 2000 was primarily due to decreases in customer transaction volumes, revenue from margin lending and asset-based fees, partially offset by higher revenue from the bank deposit program. PRIVATE CLIENT net income of $1.068 billion in 2000 increased $154 million or 17% compared to 1999 primarily reflecting increases in asset-based fees and higher margin lending revenue. The decrease in TRANSACTION SERVICES 2001 net income compared to 2000 was primarily due to increased investment spending on internet initiatives, declining spreads and a restructuring related charge of $13 million (after-tax) in 2001, partially offset by higher business volumes, including the acquisitions of Bank Handlowy and Banamex. TRANSACTION SERVICES net income of $465 million in 2000, increased $292 million from 1999 primarily reflecting higher business volumes and spreads, including the acquisition of Bank Handlowy. The improvement in Other Corporate in 2001 was primarily due to gains on building sales in Asia and release of a rent reserve in 2001 that was no longer required. The decline in 2000 was primarily due to a release of restructuring charges in 1999, partially offset by tax benefits in 2000. The businesses of GCIB are significantly affected by the levels of activity in the global capital markets which, in turn, are influenced by macro-economic and political policies and developments, among other factors, in the 100 countries in which the businesses operate. Global economic and market events can have both positive and negative effects on the revenue performance of the businesses and can affect credit performance. Losses on corporate lending activities and the level of cash-basis loans can vary widely with respect to timing and amount, particularly within any narrowly-defined business or loan type. Net credit losses and cash-basis loans may increase from the 2001 levels due to weak global economic conditions, sovereign or regulatory actions and other factors. This paragraph contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. See "Forward-Looking Statements" on page 17. The table below shows net income by region for the Global Corporate and Investment Bank. GCIB NET INCOME -- REGIONAL VIEW (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. CAPITAL MARKETS AND BANKING (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. CAPITAL MARKETS AND BANKING delivers a full range of global financial services and products including investment banking, institutional brokerage, research and advisory services, foreign exchange, structured products, derivatives, loans, leasing and equipment finance. CAPITAL MARKETS AND BANKING net income was $3.887 billion in 2001 compared to $3.567 billion in 2000 and $3.334 billion in 1999. 11
Net income increased $320 million or 9% during 2001 primarily due to strong growth in Fixed Income, Sales & Trading and gains on asset sales in CitiCapital, partially offset by weakness in Equities, lower earnings from the investment in Nikko Cordial, a higher provision for credit losses and restructuring-related charges of $121 million (after-tax) in 2001. Net income of $3.567 billion in 2000 increased $233 million or 7% compared to 1999 primarily reflecting higher Equities, higher earnings from the investment in Nikko Cordial and the acquisitions of Schroders and Bank Handlowy, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and lower Fixed Income. Revenues, net of interest expense, of $17.492 billion in 2001 increased $1.300 billion or 8% from 2000 primarily due to strong growth in Fixed Income, higher Sales & Trading, gains on asset sales in CitiCapital, the acquisition of Banamex and benefits from capital hedging activities, partially offset by weakness in Equities and lower earnings from the investment in Nikko Cordial. Revenues, net of interest expense, of $16.192 billion in 2000 increased $2.735 billion or 20% from 1999 primarily due to strong growth in Equities and Investment Banking, higher earnings from the investment in Nikko Cordial and the impact of acquisitions of Schroders and Bank Handlowy, partially offset by reductions in Fixed Income. Operating expenses were $9.941 billion in 2001 compared to $9.528 billion in 2000 and $7.656 billion in 1999. Operating expenses increased $413 million or 4% in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to increases in Fixed Income and Sales & Trading and the acquisition of Banamex, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits and expense control initiatives. Compensation and benefits decreased primarily as a result of declines in production-related compensation and savings from restructuring actions initiated in 2001. Operating expenses increased $1.872 billion or 24% in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to higher production-related compensation and benefits expense, including the acquisitions of Schroders and Bank Handlowy. The provision for credit losses was $1.439 billion in 2001 compared to $920 million in 2000 and $468 million in 1999. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to increases in the transportation leasing portfolio, higher net credit losses in the telecommunications, energy, retail and airline industries as well as write-downs in Argentina. The increase in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily reflected increases in the transportation leasing portfolio, higher net credit losses in the health care industry, recoveries on real estate loans in 1999 and the inclusion of losses for Copelco, partially offset by improvements in Asia, mainly China, Indonesia, Australia and Thailand, and in CEEMEA. Cash-basis loans were $3.048 billion, $1.901 billion and $1.481 billion at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in 2001 primarily reflects increases in the telecommunications, energy, utility and retail industries, combined with increases in CitiCapital, Mexico, Latin America, mainly Argentina, and Asia, mainly Australia and New Zealand. CitiCapital increased primarily due to increases in the transportation portfolio. The increase in Mexico primarily reflects the acquisition of Banamex which included exposures in steel, textile, food products and other industries. The increase in 2000 primarily reflects increases in the telecommunications, energy, utility and retail industries, the acquisition of Bank Handlowy as well as increases in CitiCapital, partially offset by improvements in Asia. The OREO portfolio totaled $147 million, $188 million and $231 million at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The improvements in OREO in 2001 and 2000 were primarily related to the North America real estate portfolio. Losses on corporate lending activities and the level of cash-basis loans can vary widely with respect to timing and amount, particularly within any narrowly-defined business or loan type. Net credit losses and cash-basis loans may increase from 2001 levels due to weak economic conditions in the U.S., Japan and Europe, the economic crisis in Argentina, sovereign or regulatory actions and other factors. This statement is a forward-looking statement within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. See "Forward-Looking Statements" on page 17. PRIVATE CLIENT (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. PRIVATE CLIENT provides investment advice and financial planning and brokerage services, primarily through the network of Smith Barney Financial Consultants. PRIVATE CLIENT net income was $767 million in 2001 compared to $1.068 billion in 2000 and $914 million in 1999. PRIVATE Client net income decreased $301 million or 28% during 2001 primarily due to decreases in customer transaction volumes, revenue from margin lending and asset-based fees, partially offset by higher revenue from the bank deposit program. Net income of $1.068 billion in 2000 increased $154 million or 17% compared to 1999 primarily reflecting increases in asset-based fees and higher margin lending revenue. Revenues, net of interest expense, decreased $960 million or 14% in 2001 to $5.940 billion, primarily due to declines in equity markets resulting in lower customer transaction volumes, decreases in revenue from margin lending and lower asset-based fees, partially offset by higher revenue from the bank deposit program. Revenues, net of interest expense, increased $977 million or 16% to $6.900 billion in 2000 from 1999 primarily due to increases in asset-based fees and higher margin lending revenue. The following table details trends in total assets under fee-based management, total client assets and annualized revenue per financial consultant: (1) Includes assets managed jointly with Global Investment Management. Operating expenses were $4.710 billion in 2001 compared to $5.191 billion in 2000 and $4.460 billion in 1999. Operating expenses decreased $481 million or 9% compared to 2000 primarily due to lower compensation and benefits reflecting decreases in production-related compensation, and the impact of expense control initiatives. Operating expenses of $5.191 billion in 2000, increased $731 million or 16% from 1999 primarily due to higher production related compensation and benefits expense. 12
TRANSACTION SERVICES (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. TRANSACTION SERVICES - which provides cash management, trade finance, custody, clearing and depository services globally - reported net income of $407 million in 2001, down $58 million or 12% from 2000 primarily due to increased investment spending on internet initiatives, declining spreads and a restructuring-related charge of $13 million (after-tax), partially offset by higher business volumes, including the acquisitions of Bank Handlowy and Banamex. Net income of $465 million in 2000, increased $292 million from 1999 primarily reflecting higher business volumes and spreads, including the acquisition of Bank Handlowy. As shown in the following table, average liability balances and assets under custody experienced growth in 2001 and 2000. Average liability balances of $77 billion, $64 billion and $56 billion in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, primarily reflect growth in North America and Western Europe and the acquisition of Banamex. Assets under custody increased 17% to $4.8 trillion in 2001 and 8% to $4.1 trillion in 2000 primarily reflecting increases in North America and Europe and the acquisition of Bank Handlowy. (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. Revenues, net of interest expense, were $3.516 billion in 2001, up $89 million or 3% primarily reflecting higher business volumes, including the benefit of the acquisitions of Bank Handlowy and Banamex, partially offset by lower spreads. Revenues, net of interest expense, of $3.427 billion in 2000 increased $537 million or 19% compared to 1999 primarily due to higher business volumes and spreads, including the acquisition of Bank Handlowy. Operating expenses increased $165 million or 6% in 2001 to $2.845 billion from $2.680 billion in 2000 which, in turn, increased $149 million or 6% from $2.531 billion in 1999 primarily due to internet-related investment spending and the acquisitions of Bank Handlowy and Banamex. Expense growth in 2001 also includes the impact of the Banamex acquisition. The provision for credit losses of $21 million in 2001, $27 million in 2000 and $74 million in 1999, decreased primarily reflecting improvements in CEEMEA. The decrease in 2000 also includes improvements in Asia. Cash-basis loans, which in the TRANSACTION SERVICES business are primarily trade finance receivables, were $464 million, $23 million and $44 million at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in 2001 primarily reflects increases in Mexico due to the acquisition of Banamex. The decrease in 2000 was primarily due to improvements in Asia. OTHER CORPORATE (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. OTHER CORPORATE - which includes intra-GCIB segment eliminations, certain one-time non-recurring items and tax amounts not allocated to GCIB products - reported net income of $52 million in 2001 compared to a net loss of $29 million in 2000 and net income of $33 million in 1999. The improvement in Other Corporate in 2001 was primarily due to gains on building sales in Asia and release of a rent reserve in 2001 that was no longer required. The decline in 2000 was primarily due to a release of restructuring charges in 1999, partially offset by tax benefits in 2000. GLOBAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. GLOBAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT comprises LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES, PRIVATE BANK and ASSET MANAGEMENT. These businesses offer a broad range of life insurance, annuity, asset management and personalized wealth management products and services distributed to institutional, high net worth and retail clients. Global Investment Management net income in 2001 increased to $1.596 billion, up $136 million or 9% from 2000. The 2001 increase in net income primarily reflected the Banamex acquisition in both the LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES and ASSET MANAGEMENT businesses, increased client activity across most products within PRIVATE BANK and higher business volumes and premiums within TLA. Net income of $1.460 billion in 2000 was up $217 million or 17% from 1999. The 2000 increase in net income reflected increased business volumes, a strong capital base and strong investment income at TLA, continued client revenue momentum within PRIVATE BANK along with the impact of the acquisitions of Siembra, Colfondos and Confia in ASSET MANAGEMENT. Income of $1.596 billion in 2001, $1.460 billion in 2000 and $1.243 billion in 1999 included restructuring charges of $16 million ($27 million pretax) and $11 million ($18 million pretax) in 13
2001 and 2000, respectively, and a restructuring credit of $2 million ($4 million pretax) in 1999. The table below shows net income by region for Global Investment Management. GLOBAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT NET INCOME -- REGIONAL VIEW (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. (2) Excludes investment gains/losses included in Proprietary Investment Activities segment. LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES comprises TLA and International Insurance Manufacturing. These businesses offer individual annuity, group annuity, and individual life insurance products and corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) products primarily marketed by The Travelers Insurance Company (TIC) and its wholly-owned subsidiary The Travelers Life and Annuity Company (TLAC) under the Travelers Life and Annuity name. Among the range of individual products offered are fixed and variable deferred annuities, payout annuities and term, universal and variable life insurance. These products are primarily distributed through CitiStreet Retirement Services (CitiStreet) (formerly The Copeland Companies (Copeland)), a joint venture, Salomon Smith Barney Financial Consultants, Primerica, Citibank, and a nationwide network of independent agents and the growing outside broker dealer channel. The COLI product is a variable universal life product distributed through independent specialty brokers. The group products include institutional pensions, including guaranteed investment contracts (GICs), payout annuities, group annuities to employer-sponsored retirement and savings plans and structured finance transactions. The International Insurance Manufacturing business primarily has operations in Western Europe, Latin America, Mexico and Asia. LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES net income was $836 million in 2001 compared to $794 million in 2000 and $635 million in 1999, increasing $42 million or 5% and $159 million or 25% from 2000 and 1999, respectively. The $42 million increase in net income from 2000 primarily resulted from a $41 million increase in TLA, a $13 million increase in Mexico due to the Banamex acquisition and an $8 million increase in Western Europe, partially offset by a decline in Latin America of $21 million. The $21 million decline in Latin America primarily reflected a charge for Argentine debt securities exchanged for loans held in the Siembra insurance companies, which were held in support of existing contractholders' liabilities. The $159 million increase in net income from 1999 primarily resulted from a $153 million increase in TLA and a $6 million increase in Latin America. TRAVELERS LIFE AND ANNUITY The $41 million or 5% improvement in net income in 2001 compared to 2000 reflects operating expense reductions and a 3% net investment income growth, despite the declining markets. During 2001, TLA also achieved double-digit growth in individual life direct periodic premiums, group annuity net written premiums and deposits and account balances versus the prior year. The $153 million or 25% improvement in net income in 2000 reflects increased business volume, a strong capital base and particularly strong investment income versus the prior-year period. During 2000, this business continued strong individual annuity sales and achieved double-digit business volume growth in group annuity account balances and individual life net written premiums, reflecting growth in retirement savings and estate planning products and strong momentum from cross-selling initiatives. The continued growth in 2001 and 2000 reflects both greater popularity of these products with an aging American population and strong momentum from cross-selling initiatives. Total operating expenses decreased in 2001 compared to the prior-year period due to continued expense management and the absence of expenses related to the long-term care insurance business which was sold during the third quarter of 2000. The long-term care transaction also reduced the amount of premium revenue reported in 2001. Total operating expenses decreased in 2000 compared to the prior-year period due to the contribution of Copeland to the CitiStreet joint venture and the absence of certain one-time technology expenses in 1999. The increase in revenues was also mitigated by the contribution of Copeland. The cross-selling initiatives of TLA products through Primerica, Citibank, Salomon Smith Barney Financial Consultants, and CitiStreet, as well as strong sales through various intermediaries, a nationwide network of independent agents and outside broker dealers, reflect the ongoing effort to build market share by strengthening relationships in key distribution channels. On July 31, 2000, TIC sold 90% of its individual long-term care insurance business to General Electric Capital Assurance Company in the form of an indemnity reinsurance arrangement. Proceeds from the sale were $410 million, resulting in a deferred gain of approximately $150 million after-tax. The following table shows net written premiums and deposits by product line, excluding long-term care insurance written premiums for the three years ended December 31: 14
The majority of the annuity business and a substantial portion of the life business written by TLA are accounted for as investment contracts, with the result that the premiums are considered deposits and are not included in revenues. Individual annuity account balances and benefit reserves reached $30.0 billion at December 31, 2001, up from $29.4 billion at year-end 2000 and $27.9 billion at year-end 1999. Net written premiums and deposits decreased in 2001 to $6.179 billion from $6.372 billion in 2000 (down 3%). The decrease in individual annuity net written premiums and deposits was driven by a decline in variable annuity sales due to current market conditions, but was partially offset by significant fixed annuity sales increases over the prior-year period. Non-affiliated sales channels increased 32% allowing this business to increase market share despite lower sales. Net written premiums and deposits increased in 2000 to $6.372 billion from $5.351 billion in 1999 (up 19%). Both 2001 and 2000 continue to reflect the cross-selling initiatives at all of the Citigroup affiliates, and also reflect the continued penetration of outside broker-dealer channels. Group annuity account balances and benefit reserves reached $21.0 billion at December 31, 2001, up from $17.5 billion at year-end 2000 (up 20%), and $15.1 billion at year-end 1999. During both 2001 and 2000, the group annuity business experienced continued strong sales momentum in all products, particularly long-term liability and guaranteed investment contracts. Net written premiums and deposits (excluding the Company's employee pension plan deposits) in 2001 were $7.068 billion, compared to $5.528 billion in 2000 reflecting fixed GIC growth through structured finance transactions and long-term liability growth through the extension of structured settlement broker relationships and large case employer pension sales. Net written premiums and deposits were $5.619 billion in 1999 and reflected particularly strong structured finance transactions. Direct periodic premiums and deposits for individual life insurance were $652 million in 2001 compared to $511 million in 2000 (up 28%), driven by independent agent high end estate planning and COLI sales, and $409 million in 1999. Life insurance in force was $75.0 billion at December 31, 2001, up from $66.9 billion at year-end 2000 and $60.6 billion at year-end 1999. PRIVATE BANK (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. PRIVATE BANK provides personalized wealth management services for high net worth clients around the world. PRIVATE BANK net income was $368 million in 2001, up $51 million or 16% from 2000 primarily reflecting increased client activity across most products, partially offset by increased investment spending in technology and front-end sales and servicing capabilities. Net income of $317 million in 2000 was up $47 million or 17% from 1999 primarily reflecting continued client revenue momentum, partially offset by increased front-end expenses and a moderate increase in the provision for credit losses. Client business volumes under management which include custody accounts, client assets under fee-based management and deposits and loans, were $159 billion at the end of the year, up 4% from $153 billion in 2000 reflecting strong growth in Asia and continued growth in the U.S., despite challenging market conditions. Revenues, net of interest expense, were $1.542 billion in 2001, up $125 million or 9% from 2000, primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates and higher investment product (fees and trading) revenues. The 2001 increase also reflects strong international growth in Japan and Asia, up 22% and 20%, respectively, from the prior-year period and continued growth in the North American region, up 12% from the prior-year period. Revenues in 2000 were $1.417 billion, up $205 million or 17% from 1999 reflecting increases in fee and interest-related products. The 2000 increase also reflects strong international growth in Japan, Asia and CEEMEA, up 40%, 23%, and 19%, respectively, from the prior-year period and growth in the North American region, up 15% from the prior-year period. Operating expenses of $946 million in 2001 were up $54 million or 6% from 2000 primarily reflecting continued investment spending in technology and front-end sales and servicing capabilities. Expenses were $892 million in 2000, up $124 million or 16% from 1999 primarily reflecting higher levels of bankers and product specialists hired to improve front-end sales and servicing capabilities. Operating expenses include restructuring charges of $7 million ($4 million after-tax) and $8 million ($5 million after-tax) in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and include a restructuring credit of $2 million ($1 million after-tax) in 1999. The provision for credit losses was $23 million in both 2001 and 2000, compared to $12 million in 1999. The increase in the provision for credit losses in 2000 of $11 million primarily related to a loan in Europe. Net credit losses in 2001 remained at a nominal level of 0.06% of average loans outstanding, compared with 0.09% in 2000. Loans 90 days or more past due at year-end 2001 were $135 million or 0.54% of total loans outstanding, compared with 0.23% at the end of 2000 and 0.54% at the end of 1999. Average assets of $26 billion in 2001 increased $1 billion or 4% from $25 billion in 2000, which, in turn, increased $5 billion or 25% from 1999. The increase in 2000 was primarily related to incremental margin lending and mortgage financing. ASSET MANAGEMENT (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. (2) Includes $31 billion, $30 billion, and $31 billion in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, for PRIVATE BANK clients. ASSET MANAGEMENT includes the businesses of Citigroup Asset Management (CAM), Citigroup Alternative Investments (CAI), Banamex asset management and retirement services businesses and Citigroup's other retirement services businesses in North America and Latin America. These businesses offer institutional, high net worth and retail clients a broad range of investment alternatives from investment 15
centers located around the world. Products and services offered include mutual funds, closed-end funds, separately managed accounts, unit investment trusts, alternative investments, variable annuities (through affiliated and third party insurance companies), and pension administration services. Net income of $392 million in 2001 was up $43 million or 12% compared to 2000 primarily reflecting the Banamex acquisition and an increase in CAI. Net income of $349 million in 2000 was up $11 million or 3% compared to 1999 reflecting an increase in retirement services due to Latin America acquisitions and an increase in CAM North America due to growth in asset-based fee revenue, partially offset by expense increases in the U.S. and international regions of CAM. Assets under management rose to $440 billion as of December 31, 2001, up $30 billion or 7% from $410 billion in 2000, reflecting $14 billion due to the Banamex acquisition and strong net flows, partially offset by negative market activity and the transfer of $26 billion in retail Money Market assets to the SSB Bank Deposit Program. Institutional client assets of $143 billion as of December 31, 2001 were up $28 billion or 24% compared to a year ago reflecting the Banamex acquisition and an increase in institutional money market fund and long-term product flows, partially offset by negative market action. Retail and Private Bank client assets were $237 billion, down $7 billion or 3% from $244 billion in 2000, reflecting negative market action and the impact of transfers of Money Market assets to the SSB Bank Deposit Program. Retail client assets, excluding money markets and unit investment trusts, grew 9%, driven by strong net flows, partially offset by negative market action. CAI client assets were $48 billion as of December 31, 2001, up $3 billion or 7% from $45 billion in 2000. Retirement Services assets were $12 billion as of December 31, 2001, up $6 billion from $6 billion in 2000, primarily reflecting the Banamex acquisition. Sales of proprietary mutual funds and managed account products at Salomon Smith Barney Inc. (SSB) rose 33% to $28 billion in 2001 from the prior year primarily driven by growth in managed account products, and represented 59% of SSB's retail channel sales for the year. Sales of mutual and money funds through Global Consumer's banking network were $11 billion for the year, representing 53% of total sales, including $8 billion in International and $3 billion in the U.S., of which Primerica sold $2.0 billion of proprietary U.S. mutual and money funds in 2001, a 9% increase compared to 2000, representing 67% of Primerica's total sales. Institutional long-term product sales of $28 billion increased 40% over the prior year and include $14 billion of sales to GCIB clients. Revenues, net of interest expense, increased $190 million or 10% to $2.085 billion in 2001. This was compared to $1.895 billion in 2000, which was up $392 million or 26% from 1999. The increase in 2001 was primarily due to the Banamex and other acquisitions, and the effects of positive net flows, partially offset by the impact of lower market values of assets under management and the transfer of assets to the SSB Bank Deposit Program. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions in Mexico retirement services and the acquisitions of Siembra, Colfondos and Confia in the Latin America retirement services businesses, along with continued growth in asset-based fees, partially offset by declines in the international regions of CAM. Operating expenses of $1.430 billion in 2001 increased $124 million or 9% from 2000. The increase in 2001 primarily resulted from the Banamex and retirement services acquisitions, and increases in other variable expenses related to revenue growth. Operating expenses of $1.306 billion in 2000 increased $360 million or 38% from 1999. The increase in 2000 primarily resulted from the impact of acquisitions in the retirement services businesses, as well as continued investment in sales and marketing activities, technology and product development. Operating expenses include restructuring charges of $20 million ($12 million after-tax) and $10 million ($6 million after-tax) in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and include a restructuring credit of $2 million ($1 million after-tax) in 1999. PROPRIETARY INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. PROPRIETARY INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES comprises Citigroup's venture capital activities, realized investment gains (losses) from certain insurance-related investments, results from certain proprietary investments, the results of certain investments in countries that refinanced debt under the 1989 Brady Plan or plans of a similar nature, and since August 2001, the Banamex investment portfolio. Revenues, net of interest expense, include $441 million, $2.373 billion and $882 million from proprietary investments and $143 million, ($110) million and $89 million from net realized gains from insurance-related investments for the years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Revenues, net of interest expense, in 2001 of $584 million decreased $1.679 billion from 2000 primarily reflecting lower venture capital results and current year impairment write-downs in insurance-related and other proprietary investments, partially offset by increased gains in insurance-related and other proprietary investments. Revenues, net of interest expense, in 2000 of $2.263 billion increased $1.292 billion from 1999 primarily reflecting increases in venture capital results and gains on the exchange of certain Latin American bonds. The 2000 first quarter included losses in insurance-related investments from repositioning activities designed to improve yields and maturity profiles, and write-downs in the refinancing portfolio. Proprietary Investment Activities results may fluctuate in the future as a result of market and asset-specific factors. This statement is a forward-looking statement within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. See "Forward-Looking Statements" on page 17. 16
CORPORATE/OTHER (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. CORPORATE/OTHER includes net corporate treasury results, corporate staff and other corporate expenses, certain intersegment eliminations; the remainder of Internet-related development activities, cumulative effect of accounting changes and taxes not allocated to the individual businesses, the results of discontinued operations of TPC, and in 1999 and 2000, activities related to the Associates Housing Finance (AHF) unit. In January 2000, Associates announced its intention to discontinue the loan origination operations of its AHF unit. Prior to the announcement, AHF originated and serviced loans for manufactured homes. Revenues, net of interest expense, of ($334) million in 2001 increased $248 million from 2000, primarily due to lower net treasury costs primarily related to reduced rates, and the impact of higher intersegment eliminations, partially offset by increased funding costs related to the Associates and Banamex acquisitions. Revenues, net of interest expense of ($582) million in 2000 decreased $704 million from 1999 primarily reflecting the discontinuation of AHF activity and higher net treasury costs. Operating expenses of $762 million in 2001 decreased $239 million from 2000 primarily reflecting restructuring-related items and merger related charges of $346 million, including exit costs, incurred in 2000 as a result of Citigroup's acquisition of Associates, and a 2000 $108 million pretax expense for the contribution of appreciated venture capital securities to Citigroup's Foundation, partially offset by higher intersegment eliminations and a $57 million 2001 fourth quarter pretax expense for the contribution of appreciated venture capital securities to Citigroup's Foundation, which had minimal impact on Citigroup's earnings after related tax benefits and investment gains. Operating expenses of $1.001 billion in 2000 increased $166 million from 1999 primarily reflecting restructuring-related items and merger related charges related to the Associates acquisition in 2000, partially offset by the discontinuation of AHF activity and decreases in certain unallocated corporate costs, intersegment eliminations, performance-based option expense and technology costs. The provisions for benefits, claims and credit losses in 1999 primarily related to AHF. Discontinued operations represents the results of the Travelers Property and Casualty business. Income from discontinued operations in 2001 of $1.055 billion decreased $233 million from the prior year primarily reflecting the impact of catastrophe losses associated with the events of September 11th. The 2001 cumulative effect of accounting changes of $158 million includes a 2001 first quarter charge of $42 million related to the adoption of SFAS No. 133 and a 2001 second quarter charge of $116 million reflecting the impact of adopting EITF 99-20. The 1999 cumulative effect of accounting changes of $127 million includes the 1999 first quarter charges of $135 million and $15 million related to the adoptions of SOP 97-3 and SOP 98-5, respectively, offset by a first quarter credit to earnings of $23 million due to the adoption of SOP 98-7.

Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "may increase," "may fluctuate," and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "should," "would," and "could." These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, weakening global economic conditions, the economic crisis in Argentina, higher unemployment rates and the continued increase in bankruptcy filings in the U.S. and Japan, sovereign or regulatory actions, and political conditions and developments; portfolio growth and seasonal factors; the resolution of legal proceedings and related matters; and the Company's success in managing the costs associated with the expansion of existing distribution channels and developing new ones, and in realizing increased revenues from such distribution channels, including cross-selling initiatives and electronic commerce-based efforts. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO REVIEW In the consumer portfolio, credit loss experience is expressed in terms of annualized net credit losses as a percentage of average loans. Pricing and credit policies reflect the loss experience of each particular product. Consumer loans are generally written-off no later than a predetermined number of days past due on a contractual basis, or earlier in the event of bankruptcy. The number of days is set at an appropriate level according to loan product and country. The following table summarizes delinquency and net credit loss experience in both the managed and on-balance sheet loan portfolios in terms of loans 90 days or more past due, net credit losses, and as a percentage of related loans. 17
CONSUMER LOAN DELINQUENCY AMOUNTS, NET CREDIT LOSSES, AND RATIOS (1) The ratios of 90 days or more past due and net credit losses are calculated based on end-of-period and average loans, respectively, both net of unearned income. (2) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. (3) The PRIVATE BANK results are reported as part of the Global Investment Management segment. 18
CONSUMER LOAN BALANCES, NET OF UNEARNED INCOME (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. Citigroup's allowance for credit losses of $10.088 billion is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire portfolio. For analytical purposes only, the portion of Citigroup's allowance for credit losses attributed to the consumer portfolio was $5.507 billion at December 31, 2001, $4.946 billion at December 31, 2000 and $5.220 billion at December 31, 1999. The increase in the allowance for credit losses from 2000 was primarily due to the acquisitions of Banamex and EAB. The allowance as a percentage of loans on the balance sheet was 2.22% at December 31, 2001, compared to 2.16% at December 31, 2000 and 2.68% at December 31, 1999. The increase in the allowance as a percentage of loans from the prior year primarily reflects the increase in the allowance partially offset by growth in consumer loans. On-balance sheet consumer loans of $248.2 billion grew $19 billion or 8% from December 31, 2000 primarily driven by the impact of the acquisitions of Banamex and EAB and growth in CitiFinancial, mostly real estate secured loans. On-balance sheet loans in Citi Cards declined in 2001 as growth in managed receivables was more than offset by increased securitization activity. In addition, loans in 2001 increased in Japan and Western Europe, mainly in CONSUMER FINANCE, and decreased in Asia and Latin America. The decline in Latin America loans primarily reflects reductions associated with the re-denomination of certain consumer loans in Argentina. Consumer net credit losses and loans 90 days or more past due are expected to increase from 2001 levels as a result of portfolio growth and seasonal factors and as uncertain global economic conditions persist. This statement is a forward-looking statement within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. See "Forward-Looking Statements" on page 17. GLOBAL CORPORATE PORTFOLIO REVIEW Corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a nonaccrual basis when it is determined that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful of collection or when interest or principal is past due for 90 days or more, except when the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Impaired corporate loans are written down to the extent that principal is judged to be uncollectible. Impaired collateral-dependent loans are written down to the lower of cost or collateral value. The following table summarizes corporate cash-basis loans and net credit losses: (1) Reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation. (2) Prior period cash-basis loans were restated to change the policy of the Associates Corporate Leasing business for suspending accrual of interest on past due loans to conform with other leasing businesses in the Global Corporate and Investment Bank. The prior policy of placing loans that are 60 days or more past due into cash-basis, was changed to 90 days or more past due. (3) 2001 includes Banamex cash-basis loans and net-credit losses. (4) In 1999, excludes amounts related to manufactured housing, as such loan origination operations were discontinued in early 2000. Excluded cash-basis loans and net-credit losses relating to manufactured housing were $55 million and $36 million, respectively. (5) Investment Activities results are reported in the Proprietary Investment Activities segment. Corporate cash-basis loans were $3.533 billion, $1.970 billion, and $1.580 billion at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Cash-basis loans increased $1.563 billion in 2001 primarily due to increases in CAPITAL MARKETS AND BANKING, and TRANSACTION SERVICES. CAPITAL MARKETS AND BANKING primarily reflects increases in the telecommunications, energy, utility and retail industries, combined with increases in CitiCapital, Mexico, Latin America, mainly Argentina, and Asia, mainly Australia and New Zealand. CitiCapital increased primarily due to increases in the transportation portfolio. The increase in Mexico primarily reflects the acquisition of Banamex which includes exposures in steel, textile, food products and other industries. TRANSACTION SERVICES increased primarily due to increases in Mexico due to the acquisition of Banamex. Cash-basis loans increased $390 million in 2000 primarily due to increases in CAPITAL MARKETS AND BANKING which reflects increases in the telecommunications, energy, utility and retail industries, the acquisition of Bank Handlowy as well as increases in CitiCapital, partially offset by improvements in Asia. Total Other Repossessed Assets were $144 million, $292 million and $256 million at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, primarily reflecting increases in repossessed transportation equipment and the acquisition of Banamex. 19
Total Corporate loans outstanding at December 31, 2001 were $144 billion compared to $138 billion and $120 billion at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Total corporate net credit losses of $1.636 billion in 2001 increased $865 million compared to 2000 reflecting increases in the transportation leasing portfolio, higher net credit losses in the telecommunications, energy, retail and airline industries as well as write-downs in Argentina. Total corporate net credit losses of $771 million in 2000 increased $217 million compared to 1999 primarily reflecting increases in the transportation leasing portfolio, higher net credit losses in the health care industry, 1999 recoveries on real estate loans and the inclusion of losses for Copelco, partially offset by improvements in Asia, mainly China, Indonesia, Australia and Thailand, and in CEEMEA. Citigroup's allowance for credit losses of $10.088 billion is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire portfolio. For analytical purposes only, the portion of Citigroup's allowance for credit losses attributed to the corporate portfolio was $4.581 billion at December 31, 2001 compared to $4.015 billion and $3.633 billion at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in the allowance at December 31, 2001 primarily reflects the acquisition of Banamex. The increase in the allowance at December 31, 2000 primarily reflects additional provisions related to the transportation portfolio. Losses on corporate lending activities and the level of cash-basis loans can vary widely with respect to timing and amount, particularly within any narrowly-defined business or loan type. Corporate net credit losses and cash-basis loans may increase from the 2001 levels due to weakening global economic conditions, the economic crisis in Argentina, sovereign or regulatory actions and other factors.

EXHIBIT 99.02 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT The Board of Directors and Stockholders Citigroup Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position of Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2001. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2001 the Company changed its methods of accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, accounting for interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets, and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets resulting from business combinations consummated after June 30, 2001. Also, as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1999 the Company changed its methods of accounting for insurance-related assessments, accounting for insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not transfer insurance risk, and accounting for the costs of start-up activities. /s/ KPMG LLP New York, New York January 17, 2002, except as to notes 1, 3, 4, 15 and 21, which are as of November 20, 2002 1

CITIGROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Citigroup and its subsidiaries (the Company). Twenty-to-fifty percent-owned affiliates, other than investments of designated venture capital subsidiaries, are accounted for under the equity method, and the pro rata share of their income (loss) is included in other income. Income from investments in less than twenty percent-owned companies is generally recognized when dividends are received. Gains and losses on disposition of branches, subsidiaries, affiliates, and other investments and charges for management's estimate of impairment in their value that is other than temporary, such that recovery of the carrying amount is deemed unlikely, are included in other income. On July 1, 2001 the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, "Business Combinations," (SFAS 141) and certain provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," SFAS 142 as required for goodwill and intangible assets resulting from business combinations consummated after June 30, 2001. Goodwill related to purchase acquisitions completed prior to June 30, 2001 is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life through the end of the year, while goodwill related to purchase acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001, principally Banamex and EAB (as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), is not amortized. On January 1, 2002, Citigroup adopted the remaining provisions of SFAS 142 under which goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to annual impairment tests. See Future Application of Accounting Standards in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, subject to periodic review for impairment that is other than temporary. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142, if it was determined that enterprise level goodwill was unlikely to be recovered, impairment was measured on a discounted cash-flow basis. The Company recognizes a gain or loss in the Consolidated Statement of Income when a subsidiary issues its own stock to a third party at a price higher or lower than the Company's proportionate carrying amount. On August 20, 2002, Citigroup completed the distribution to its stockholders of a majority portion of its remaining ownership interest in Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC) (an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup on December 31, 2001). Following the distribution, Citigroup began reporting TPC separately as discontinued operations in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows for all periods presented. In accordance with GAAP, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position has not been restated. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of discontinued operations. Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated into U.S. dollar equivalents using year-end spot foreign exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated monthly at amounts which approximate weighted average exchange rates, with resulting gains and losses included in income. The effects of translating operations with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are included in stockholders' equity along with related hedge and tax effects. The effects of translating operations with the U.S. dollar as the functional currency, including those in highly inflationary environments, are included in other income along with related hedge effects. Hedges of foreign currency exposures include forward currency contracts and designated issues of non-U.S. dollar debt. USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. CASH FLOWS. Cash equivalents are defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks. Cash flows from risk management activities are classified in the same category as the related assets and liabilities. INVESTMENTS. Investments include fixed maturity and equity securities. Fixed maturities include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks, as well as certain loan-backed and structured securities subject to prepayment risk. Equity securities include common and non-redeemable preferred stocks. Fixed maturities classified as "held to maturity" represent securities that the Company has both the ability and the intent to hold until maturity and are carried at amortized cost. Fixed maturity securities classified as "available-for-sale" and marketable equity securities are carried at fair values, based primarily on quoted market prices or if quoted market prices are not available, discounted expected cash flows using market rates commensurate with the credit quality and maturity of the investment, with unrealized gains and losses and related hedge effects reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of applicable income taxes. Declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary are charged to earnings. Accrual of income is suspended on fixed maturities that are in default, or on which it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled. Fixed maturities subject to prepayment risk are accounted for using the retrospective method, where the principal amortization and effective yield are recalculated each period based on actual historical and projected future cash flows. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in earnings on a specific identified cost basis. Citigroup's venture capital subsidiaries include subsidiaries registered as Small Business Investment Companies and other subsidiaries that engage exclusively in venture capital activities. Venture capital investments are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in other income. The fair values of publicly-traded securities held by these subsidiaries are generally based upon quoted market prices. In certain situations, including thinly-traded securities, large-block holdings, restricted shares or other special situations, the quoted market price is adjusted to produce an estimate of the attainable fair value for the securities. For securities held by these subsidiaries that are not publicly traded, estimates of fair value are made based upon review of the investee's financial results, condition, and prospects, together with comparisons to similar companies for which quoted market prices are available. SECURITIES BORROWED AND SECURITIES LOANED are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received. With respect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount in excess of the market value of securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and loaned on a daily basis with 6
additional collateral obtained as necessary. Interest received or paid is recorded in interest income or interest expense. REPURCHASE AND RESALE AGREEMENTS are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently reacquired or resold, including accrued interest, as specified in the respective agreements. The Company's policy is to take possession of securities purchased under agreements to resell. The market value of securities to be repurchased and resold is monitored, and additional collateral is obtained where appropriate to protect against credit exposure. TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES include securities, commodities and derivatives and are recorded at either market value or, when market prices are not readily available, fair value, which is determined under an alternative approach, such as matrix or model pricing. Obligations to deliver securities sold but not yet purchased are also valued at market and included in trading account liabilities. The determination of market or fair value considers various factors, including: closing exchange or over-the-counter market price quotations; time value and volatility factors underlying options, warrants and derivatives; price activity for equivalent or synthetic instruments; counterparty credit quality; the potential impact on market prices or fair value of liquidating the Company's positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions; and derivatives transaction maintenance costs during that period. Interest expense on trading account liabilities is reported as a reduction of interest revenues. Commodities include physical quantities of commodities involving future settlement or delivery, and related gains or losses are reported as principal transactions. Derivatives used for trading purposes include interest rate, currency, equity, credit, and commodity swap agreements, options, caps and floors, warrants, and financial and commodity futures and forward contracts. The fair value of derivatives is determined based upon liquid market prices evidenced by exchange traded prices, broker-dealer quotations or prices of other transactions with similarly rated counterparties. The fair value includes an adjustment for individual counterparty credit risk and other adjustments, as appropriate, to reflect liquidity and ongoing servicing costs. The fair values (unrealized gains and losses) associated with derivatives are reported net by counterparty, provided a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists, and are netted across products and against cash collateral when such provisions are stated in the master netting agreement. Derivatives in a net receivable position, as well as options owned and warrants held, are reported as trading account assets. Similarly, derivatives in a net payable position, as well as options written and warrants issued, are reported as trading account liabilities. Revenues generated from derivative instruments used for trading purposes are reported as principal transactions and include realized gains and losses as well as unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the market or fair value of such instruments. COMMISSIONS, UNDERWRITING AND PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS revenues and related expenses are recognized in income on a trade date basis. CONSUMER LOANS includes loans managed by the Global Consumer business and PRIVATE BANK. Consumer loans are generally written off not later than a predetermined number of days past due primarily on a contractual basis, or earlier in the event of bankruptcy. The number of days is set at an appropriate level by loan product and by country. The policy for suspending accruals of interest on consumer loans varies depending on the terms, security and loan loss experience characteristics of each product, and in consideration of write-off criteria in place. CORPORATE LOANS represent loans managed by GCIB, Global Investment Management's LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES business and Proprietary Investment Activities. Corporate loans are identified as impaired and placed on a cash (nonaccrual) basis when it is determined that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful of collection, or when interest or principal is past due for 90 days or more, except when the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Any interest accrued is reversed and charged against current earnings, and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash. When there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of principal, all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan. Impaired corporate loans are written down to the extent that principal is judged to be uncollectible. Impaired collateral-dependent loans where repayment is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment are written down to the lower of cost or collateral value. Cash-basis loans are returned to an accrual status when all contractual principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms. LEASE FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. Loans include the Company's share of aggregate rentals on lease financing transactions and residual values net of related unearned income. Lease financing transactions substantially represent direct financing leases and also include leveraged leases. Unearned income is amortized under a method which results in an approximate level rate of return when related to the unrecovered lease investment. Gains and losses from sales of residual values of leased equipment are included in other income. SECURITIZATIONS primarily include sales of credit card receivables, mortgages and home equity loans. Revenue on securitized credit card receivables is recorded monthly as earned over the term of each securitization transaction, which may range up to 12 years. The revolving nature of the receivables sold and the monthly recognition of revenue result in a pattern of recognition that is similar to the pattern that would be experienced if the receivables had not been sold. Net revenue on securitized credit card receivables is collected over the life of each sale transaction. The net revenue is based upon the sum of finance charges and fees received from cardholders and interchange revenue earned on cardholder transactions, less the sum of the yield paid to investors, credit losses, transaction costs, and a contractual servicing fee, which is also retained by certain Citigroup subsidiaries as servicers. The Company retains a seller's interest in the credit card receivables transferred to the trust, which is not in securitized form. Accordingly, the seller's interest is carried on a historical cost basis and classified as consumer loans. Retained interests in securitized mortgage loans are classified as investments. Servicing rights retained in the securitization of mortgage and home equity loans are measured by allocating the carrying value of the loans between the assets sold and the interest retained, based on the relative fair value at the date of the securitization. The fair market values are determined using either financial models, quoted market prices or sales of similar assets. Gain or loss on the sale of mortgage loans is recognized at the time of the securitizations. Mortgage servicing assets are amortized over the expected life of the loan and are evaluated periodically for impairment. LOANS HELD FOR SALE. Credit card and other receivables and mortgage loans originated for sale are classified as loans held for sale, which are accounted for at the lower of cost or market value in other assets with net credit losses charged to other income. 7
ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES represents management's estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio. Attribution of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only, and the entire allowance is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio including unfunded commitments. Additions to the allowance are made by means of the provision for credit losses. Credit losses are deducted from the allowance, and subsequent recoveries are added. Securities received in exchange for loan claims in debt restructurings are initially recorded at fair value, with any gain or loss reflected as a recovery or charge-off to the allowance, and are subsequently accounted for as securities available-for-sale. Larger-balance, non-homogenous exposures representing significant individual credit exposures are evaluated based upon the borrower's overall financial condition, resources, and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. The allowance for credit losses attributed to these loans is established via a process which begins with estimates of probable loss inherent in the portfolio based upon various statistical analyses. These analyses consider historical and projected default rates and loss severities; internal risk ratings; geographic, industry, and other environmental factors; and model imprecision. Management also considers overall portfolio indicators including trends in internally risk-rated exposures, classified exposures, cash-basis loans, and historical and forecasted write-offs; and a review of industry, geographic, and portfolio concentrations, including current developments within those segments. In addition, management considers the current business strategy and credit process, including credit limit setting and compliance, credit approvals, loan underwriting criteria, and loan workout procedures. Within the allowance for credit losses, a valuation allowance is maintained for larger-balance, non-homogenous loans that have been individually determined to be impaired. This estimate considers all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate, the secondary market value of the loan and the fair value of collateral. Each portfolio of smaller-balance, homogenous loans, including consumer mortgage, installment, revolving credit and most other consumer loans, is collectively evaluated for impairment. The allowance for credit losses attributed to these loans is established via a process that begins with estimates of probable losses inherent in the portfolio, based upon various statistical analyses. These include migration analysis, in which historical delinquency and credit loss experience is applied to the current aging of the portfolio, together with analyses that reflect current trends and conditions. Management also considers overall portfolio indicators including historical credit losses, delinquent, non-performing and classified loans, and trends in volumes and terms of loans; an evaluation of overall credit quality and the credit process, including lending policies and procedures; consideration of economic, geographical, product, and other environmental factors; and model imprecision. This evaluation includes an assessment of the ability of borrowers with foreign currency obligations to obtain the foreign exchange necessary for orderly debt servicing. REPOSSESSED ASSETS. Upon repossession, loans are adjusted, if necessary, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and transferred to Repossessed Assets, which is reported in other assets net of a valuation allowance for selling costs and net declines in value as appropriate. RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES - DERIVATIVES USED FOR NON-TRADING PURPOSES. The Company manages its exposures to market rate movements outside of its trading activities by modifying the asset and liability mix, either directly or through the use of derivative financial products including interest rate swaps, futures, forwards, and purchased option positions such as interest rate caps, floors, and collars as well as foreign exchange contracts. These end-user derivatives are carried at fair value in other assets or other liabilities. To qualify as a hedge, the hedge relationship is designated and formally documented at inception detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge which includes the item and risk that is being hedged, the derivative that is being used, as well as how effectiveness is being assessed. A derivative must be highly effective in accomplishing the objective of offsetting either changes in fair value or cash flows for the risk being hedged. The effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated on a retrospective and prospective basis using quantitative measures of correlation. If a hedge relationship is found to be ineffective, it no longer qualifies as a hedge and any excess gains or losses attributable to such ineffectiveness, as well as subsequent changes in fair value, are recognized in other income. The foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis, consistent with the level at which market risk is managed, but are subject to various limits and controls. The underlying asset, liability, firm commitment or forecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar items. For fair value hedges, in which derivatives hedge the fair value of assets, liabilities or firm commitments, changes in the fair value of derivatives are reflected in other income, together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item. The net amount, representing hedge ineffectiveness, is reflected in current earnings. Citigroup's fair value hedges are primarily the hedges of fixed-rate long-term debt, loans and available-for-sale securities. For cash flow hedges, in which derivatives hedge the variability of cash flows related to floating rate assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions, the accounting treatment depends on the effectiveness of the hedge. To the extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows, changes in the derivatives' fair value will not be included in current earnings but are reported as other changes in stockholders' equity from nonowner sources. These changes in fair value will be included in earnings of future periods when earnings are also affected by the variability of the hedged cash flows. To the extent these derivatives are not effective, changes in their fair values are immediately included in other income. Citigroup's cash flow hedges primarily include hedges of floating rate credit card receivables and loans, rollovers of commercial paper and foreign currency denominated funding. Cash flow hedges also include hedges of certain forecasted transactions up to a maximum tenor of 30 years, although a substantial majority of the maturities is under five years. For net investment hedges, in which derivatives hedge the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, the accounting treatment will similarly depend on the effectiveness of the hedge. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative, including any forward premium or discount, is reflected in other changes in stockholders' equity from nonowner sources as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment. Non-trading derivatives that are either hedging instruments that are carried at fair value or do not qualify as hedges are also carried at fair value with changes in value included either as an element of the yield or return on the hedged item or in other income. For those hedge relationships that are terminated, hedge designations that are removed, or forecasted transactions that are no longer expected to occur, the hedge accounting treatment described in the paragraphs above is no longer applied. The end-user derivative is terminated or transferred to the trading account. For fair value hedges, 8
any changes to the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately reflected as an element of the yield. For cash flow hedges, any changes in fair value of the end-user derivative remain in other changes in stockholders' equity from nonowner sources and are included in earnings of future periods when earnings are also affected by the variability of the hedged cash flow. If the hedged relationship was discontinued or a forecasted transaction is not expected to occur when scheduled, any changes in fair value of the end-user derivative are immediately reflected in other income. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133), on January 1, 2001 (see Accounting Changes below), end-user derivatives designated in qualifying hedges were accounted for consistent with the risk management strategy as follows. Amounts payable and receivable on interest rate swaps and options were accrued according to the contractual terms and included in the related revenue and expense category as an element of the yield on the associated instrument (including the amortization of option premiums). Amounts paid or received over the life of futures contracts were deferred until the contract is closed; accumulated deferred amounts on futures contracts and amounts paid or received at settlement of forward contracts were accounted for as elements of the carrying value of the associated instrument, affecting the resulting yield. End-user contracts related to instruments carried at fair value were also carried at fair value, with amounts payable and receivable accounted for as an element of the yield on the associated instrument. When related to securities available-for-sale, fair value adjustments were reported in stockholders' equity, net of tax. If an end-user derivative contract was terminated, any resulting gain or loss was deferred and amortized over the original term of the agreement provided that the effectiveness criteria had been met. If the underlying designated items were no longer held, or if an anticipated transaction was no longer likely to occur, any previously unrecognized gain or loss on the derivative contract was recognized in earnings and the contract was accounted for at fair value with subsequent changes recognized in earnings. Foreign exchange contracts which qualified as hedges of foreign currency exposures, including net capital investments outside the U.S., were revalued at the spot rate with any forward premium or discount recognized over the life of the contract in interest revenue or interest expense. Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts which qualified as a hedge of a firm commitment were deferred and recognized as part of the measurement of the related transaction, unless deferral of a loss would have led to recognizing losses on the transaction in later periods. INSURANCE PREMIUMS from long-duration contracts, principally life insurance, are earned when due. Premiums from short-duration insurance contracts are earned over the related contract period. Short-duration contracts include primarily property and casualty, including estimated ultimate premiums on retrospectively rated policies, and credit life and accident and health policies. VALUE OF INSURANCE IN FORCE, included in other assets, represents the actuarially determined present value of anticipated profits to be realized from life and accident and health business on insurance in force at the date of the Company's acquisition of its insurance subsidiaries using the same assumptions that were used for computing related liabilities where appropriate. The value of insurance in force acquired prior to December 31, 1993 is amortized over the premium paying periods in relation to anticipated premiums. The value of insurance in force relating to the 1993 acquisition of The Travelers Corporation was the actuarially determined present value of the projected future profits discounted at interest rates ranging from 14% to 18% for the business acquired. The value of insurance in force is amortized over the contract period using current interest crediting rates to accrete interest and using amortization methods based on the specified products. Traditional life insurance is amortized over the period of anticipated premiums; universal life in relation to estimated gross profits; and annuity contracts employing a level yield method. The value of insurance in force is reviewed periodically for recoverability to determine if any adjustment is required. DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS, included in other assets, for the life insurance business represent the costs of acquiring new business, principally commissions, certain underwriting and agency expenses and the cost of issuing policies. Deferred policy acquisition costs for the traditional life business are amortized over the premium-paying periods of the related policies, in proportion to the ratio of the annual premium revenue to the total anticipated premium revenue. Deferred policy acquisition costs of other business lines are generally amortized over the life of the insurance contract or at a constant rate based upon the present value of estimated gross profits expected to be realized. For certain property and casualty lines, acquisition costs (primarily commissions and premium taxes) have been deferred to the extent recoverable from future earned premiums and are amortized ratably over the terms of the related policies. Deferred policy acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, including investment income, and, if not recoverable, are charged to expense. All other acquisition expenses are charged to operations as incurred. SEPARATE AND VARIABLE ACCOUNTS primarily represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to, and investment risk is borne by, the contractholders. Each account has specific investment objectives. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of the Company. The assets of these accounts are generally carried at market value. Amounts assessed to the contractholders for management services are included in revenues. Deposits, net investment income and realized investment gains and losses for these accounts are excluded from revenues, and related liability increases are excluded from benefits and expenses. INSURANCE POLICY AND CLAIMS RESERVES represent liabilities for future insurance policy benefits. Insurance reserves for traditional life insurance, annuities, and accident and health policies have been computed based upon mortality, morbidity, persistency and interest rate assumptions (ranging from 2.5% to 8.1%) applicable to these coverages, including adverse deviation. These assumptions consider Company experience and industry standards and may be revised if it is determined that future experience will differ substantially from that previously assumed. Property-casualty reserves include (1) unearned premiums representing the unexpired portion of policy premiums, and (2) estimated provisions for both reported and unreported claims incurred and related expenses. The reserves are adjusted regularly based on experience. In determining insurance policy and claims reserves, the Company performs a continuing review of its overall position, its reserving techniques and its reinsurance. The reserves are also reviewed periodically by a qualified actuary employed by the Company. Reserves for property-casualty insurance losses represent the estimated ultimate cost of all incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses. Since the reserves are based on estimates, the ultimate liability may be more or less than such reserves. The effects of changes in such estimated reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. Such changes may be material to the results of operations and could occur in a future period. 9
CONTRACTHOLDER FUNDS represent receipts from the issuance of universal life, pension investment and certain individual annuity contracts. Such receipts are considered deposits on investment contracts that do not have substantial mortality or morbidity risk. Account balances are increased by deposits received and interest credited and are reduced by withdrawals, mortality charges and administrative expenses charged to the contractholders. Calculations of contractholder account balances for investment contracts reflect lapse, withdrawal and interest rate assumptions (ranging from 1.9% to 14.0%) based on contract provisions, the Company's experience and industry standards. Contractholder funds also include other funds that policyholders leave on deposit with the Company. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE includes prior and current service costs of pension and other postretirement benefit plans, which are accrued on a current basis, contributions and unrestricted awards under other employee plans, the amortization of restricted stock awards, and costs of other employee benefits. There are no charges to earnings upon the grant or exercise of fixed stock options or the subscription for or purchase of stock under stock purchase agreements. Compensation expense related to performance-based stock options granted in prior periods was recorded over the periods to the vesting dates. Upon issuance of previously unissued shares under employee plans, proceeds received in excess of par value are credited to additional paid-in capital. Upon issuance of treasury shares, the difference between the proceeds received and the average cost of treasury shares is recorded in additional paid-in capital. INCOME TAXES. Deferred taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns, based upon enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management's judgment that realization is more likely than not. The Company and its wholly owned domestic non-life insurance subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal income tax return. The major life insurance subsidiaries are included in their own consolidated Federal income tax return. Associates filed separate consolidated Federal income tax returns prior to the merger. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE is computed after recognition of preferred stock dividend requirements. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, excluding restricted stock. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and has been computed after giving consideration to the weighted average dilutive effect of the Company's convertible securities, common stock warrants, stock options and the shares issued under the Company's Capital Accumulation Plan and other restricted stock plans. ACCOUNTING CHANGES ADOPTION OF EITF 99-20. During the second quarter of 2001, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 99-20, "Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets" (EITF 99-20). EITF 99-20 provides new guidance regarding income recognition and identification and determination of impairment on certain asset-backed securities. The initial adoption resulted in a cumulative adjustment of $116 million after-tax, recorded as a charge to earnings, and an increase of $93 million included in other changes in stockholders' equity from nonowner sources. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING. On January 1, 2001, Citigroup adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." These new rules changed the accounting treatment of derivative contracts (including foreign exchange contracts) that are employed to manage risk outside of Citigroup's trading activities, as well as certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts. SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. The treatment of changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the character of the transaction, including whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship. The majority of Citigroup's derivatives are entered into for trading purposes and were not impacted by the adoption of SFAS 133. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 133 at January 1, 2001 was an after-tax charge of $42 million included in net income and an increase of $25 million included in other changes in stockholders' equity from nonowner sources. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. Effective July 1, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and certain provisions of SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" as required for goodwill and intangible assets resulting from business combinations consummated after June 30, 2001. The new rules require that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for under the purchase method. The nonamortization provisions of the new rules affecting goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are effective for all purchase business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. INSURANCE-RELATED ASSESSMENTS. During the first quarter of 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-3, "Accounting by Insurance and Other Enterprises for Insurance-Related Assessments." SOP 97-3 provides guidance for determining when an entity should recognize a liability for guaranty-fund and other insurance-related assessments, how to measure that liability, and when an asset may be recognized for the recovery of such assessments through premium tax offsets or policy surcharges. The initial adoption resulted in a cumulative adjustment recorded as a charge to earnings of $135 million after-tax and minority interest. DEPOSIT ACCOUNTING. During the first quarter of 1999, the Company adopted SOP 98-7, "Deposit Accounting: Accounting for Insurance and Reinsurance Contracts That Do Not Transfer Insurance Risk." SOP 98-7 provides guidance on how to account for insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not transfer insurance risk and applies to all entities and all such contracts, except for long-duration life and health insurance contracts. The method used to account for such contracts is referred to as deposit accounting. The initial adoption resulted in a cumulative adjustment recorded as a credit to earnings of $23 million after-tax and minority interest. START-UP COSTS. During the first quarter of 1999, the Company adopted SOP 98-5, "Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities." SOP 98-5 requires costs of start-up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred. The initial adoption resulted in a cumulative adjustment recorded as a charge to earnings of $15 million after-tax. FUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS On January 1, 2002, Citigroup adopted the remaining provisions of SFAS 142, when the rules became effective for calendar year companies. Under the new rules, effective January 1, 2002, goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to annual impairment tests. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. Based on current levels of goodwill and an evaluation of the Company's intangible assets, which determined that certain intangible assets should be reclassified as goodwill and identified as other 10
intangible assets that have indefinite lives, the nonamortization provisions of the new standards will reduce other expense by approximately $610 million and increase net income by approximately $480 million in 2002. During 2002, the Company will perform the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of January 1, 2002. It is not expected that the adoption of the remaining provisions of SFAS 142 will have a material effect on the financial statements as a result of these impairment tests. TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS In September 2000, FASB issued SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125" (SFAS 140). In July 2001, FASB issued Technical Bulletin No. 01-1, "Effective Date for Certain Financial Institutions of Certain Provisions of Statement 140 Related to the Isolation of Transferred Assets." Certain provisions of SFAS 140 require that the structure for transfers of financial assets to certain securitization vehicles be modified to comply with revised isolation guidance for institutions subject to receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. These provisions are effective for transfers taking place after December 31, 2001, with an additional transition period ending no later than September 30, 2006 for transfers to certain master trusts. It is not expected that these provisions will materially affect the financial statements. SFAS 140 also provides revised guidance for an entity to be considered a qualifying special purpose entity. IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS On January 1, 2002, Citigroup adopted SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (SFAS 144), when the rule became effective for calendar year companies. SFAS 144 establishes additional criteria as compared to existing generally accepted accounting principles to determine when a long-lived asset is held for sale. It also broadens the definition of "discontinued operations," but does not allow for the accrual of future operating losses, as was previously permitted. The provisions of the new standard are generally to be applied prospectively. 2. BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS ACQUISITION OF BANAMEX In August 2001, Citicorp completed its acquisition of Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival (Banamex), a leading Mexican financial institution, for approximately $12.5 billion in cash and Citigroup stock. On September 24, 2001, Citicorp became the holder of 100% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Banamex following a share redemption by Banamex. Banamex's and Citicorp's banking operations in Mexico have been integrated and conduct business under the "Banamex" brand name. ACQUISITION OF EAB On July 17, 2001, Citibank completed its acquisition of European American Bank (EAB), a New York state-chartered bank, for $1.6 billion plus the assumption of $350 million in EAB preferred stock. ACQUISITION OF ASSOCIATES On November 30, 2000, Citigroup Inc., completed its acquisition of Associates First Capital Corporation (Associates). The acquisition was consummated through a merger of a subsidiary of Citigroup with and into Associates (with Associates as the surviving corporation) pursuant to which each share of Associates common stock became a right to receive .7334 of a share of Citigroup Inc. common stock (534.5 million shares). Subsequent to the acquisition, Associates was contributed to and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citicorp and Citicorp issued a full and unconditional guarantee of the outstanding long-term debt securities and commercial paper of Associates. Associates' debt securities and commercial paper will no longer be separately rated. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests. 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (SUBSEQUENT EVENT) Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC) (an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup on December 31, 2001) sold 231 million shares of its class A common stock representing approximately 23.1% of its outstanding equity securities in an initial public offering (IPO) on March 27, 2002. Citigroup recognized an after-tax gain of $1.061 billion in the 2002 first quarter as a result of the IPO. The after-tax gain was increased by $97 million in the 2002 third quarter due to the receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and the resolution of certain tax matters related to the IPO. In connection with the IPO, Citigroup entered into an agreement with TPC that provides that, in any fiscal year in which TPC records asbestos-related income statement charges in excess of $150 million, net of any reinsurance, Citigroup will pay to TPC the amount of any such excess up to a cumulative aggregate of $800 million, reduced by the tax effect of the highest applicable federal income tax rate. A portion of the gross IPO gain was deferred to offset any payments arising in connection with this agreement. On October 16, 2002, notice was given that $159 million will be payable in the 2002 fourth quarter, pursuant to this agreement. On August 20, 2002, Citigroup completed the distribution to its stockholders of a majority portion of its remaining ownership interest in TPC (the distribution). This non-cash distribution was tax-free to Citigroup, its stockholders and TPC. The distribution was treated as a dividend to stockholders for accounting purposes that reduced Citigroup's Additional Paid-In Capital by approximately $6.9 billion. Following the distribution, Citigroup remains a holder of approximately 9.9% of TPC's outstanding equity securities which will be carried at fair value in the Proprietary Investment Activities segment and classified as available-for-sale within Investments on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Following the August 20, 2002 distribution, the results of TPC are reported in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and Cash Flows separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In accordance with GAAP, the Statement of Consolidated Financial Position has not been restated. TPC represented the primary vehicle by which Citigroup engaged in the property and casualty insurance business. Summarized financial information for discontinued operations is as follows: 11
The following is a summary of the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations as of August 20, 2002, the date of the distribution: 4.

(2) Increase primarily relates to the inclusion of Banamex portfolio of Mexican government securities. (3) Includes non-marketable equity securities carried at cost, which are reported in both the amortized cost and fair value columns. 13
The accompanying table shows components of interest and dividends on investments, realized gains and losses from sales of investments, and net gains on investments held by venture capital subsidiaries: (1) Includes net realized gains related to insurance subsidiaries' sale of OREO and mortgage loans of $8 million, $74 million, and $215 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

(2) Investments with no stated maturities are included as contractual maturities of greater than 10 years. Actual maturities may differ due to call or prepayment rights. (3) Includes foreign government, U.S. corporate, mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. corporations, and other debt securities. Yields reflect the impact of local interest rates prevailing in countries outside the U.S. 6. FEDERAL FUNDS, SECURITIES BORROWED, LOANED, AND SUBJECT TO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, at their respective carrying values, consisted of the following at December 31: Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, at their respective carrying values, consisted of the following at December 31: The resale and repurchase agreements represent collateralized financing transactions used to generate net interest income and facilitate trading activity. These instruments are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities and generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to a year. It is the Company's policy to take possession of the underlying collateral, monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements, and, when necessary, require prompt transfer of additional collateral or reduction in the balance in order to maintain contractual margin protection. In the event of counterparty default, the financing agreement provides the Company with the right to liquidate the collateral held. Resale agreements and repurchase agreements are reported net by counterparty, when applicable, pursuant to FASB Interpretation 41, "Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements" (FIN 41). Excluding the impact of FIN 41, resale agreements totaled $141.2 billion and $118.9 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Deposits paid for securities borrowed (securities borrowed) and deposits received for securities loaned (securities loaned) are recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received and are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, corporate debt and equity securities. Securities borrowed transactions require the Company to deposit cash with the lender. With respect to securities loaned, the Company receives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value of securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned daily, and additional collateral is obtained as necessary. Securities borrowed and securities loaned are reported net by counterparty, when applicable, pursuant to FAS Interpretation 39, "Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts" (FIN 39). 7. BROKERAGE RECEIVABLES AND BROKERAGE PAYABLES The Company has receivables and payables for financial instruments purchased from and sold to brokers and dealers and customers. The Company is exposed to risk of loss from the inability of brokers and dealers or customers to pay for purchases or to deliver the financial instrument sold, in which case the Company would have to sell or purchase the financial instruments at prevailing market prices. Credit risk is reduced to the extent that an exchange or clearing organization acts as a counterparty to the transaction. 14
The Company seeks to protect itself from the risks associated with customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines. Margin levels are monitored daily, and customers deposit additional collateral as required. Where customers cannot meet collateral requirements, the Company will liquidate sufficient underlying financial instruments to bring the customer into compliance with the required margin level. Exposure to credit risk is impacted by market volatility, which may impair the ability of clients to satisfy their obligations to the Company. Credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers and brokers and dealers engaged in forward and futures and other transactions deemed to be credit sensitive. Brokerage receivables and brokerage payables, which arise in the normal course of business, consisted of the following at December 31: 8. TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Trading account assets and liabilities, at market value, consisted of the following at December 31: (1) Net of master netting agreements. 9. TRADING RELATED REVENUE Trading related revenue consists of principal transactions revenues and net interest revenue associated with trading activities. Principal transactions revenues consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading activities. The following table presents trading related revenue for the years ended December 31: (1) Includes revenues from government securities and corporate debt, municipal securities, preferred stock, mortgage securities, and other debt instruments. Also includes spot and forward trading of currencies and exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) currency options, options on fixed income securities, interest rate swaps, currency swaps, swap options, caps and floors, financial futures, OTC options and forward contracts on fixed income securities. (2) Includes revenues from common and convertible preferred stock, convertible corporate debt, equity-linked notes, and exchange-traded and OTC equity options and warrants. (3) Includes revenues from foreign exchange spot, forward, option and swap contracts. (4) Primarily includes revenues from the results of Phibro Inc. (Phibro), which trades crude oil, refined oil products, natural gas, electricity, metals, and other commodities. Also includes revenues related to arbitrage strategies. The following table reconciles principal transactions revenues on the Consolidated Statement of Income to trading related revenue for the years ended December 31: 15
10. LOANS (1) Loans secured primarily by real estate. (2) Includes $4.9 billion in 2001 and $3.7 billion in 2000 of commercial real estate loans related to community banking and private banking activities. (3) Includes $2.5 billion in 2001 and $2.7 billion in 2000 of loans secured by commercial real estate. (4) Includes loans not otherwise separately categorized. Impaired loans are those on which Citigroup believes it is not probable that it will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan, excluding smaller-balance homogeneous loans that are evaluated collectively for impairment, and are carried on a cash basis. Valuation allowances for these loans are estimated considering all available evidence including, as appropriate, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate, the secondary market value of the loan and the fair value of collateral. The following table presents information about impaired loans. (1) Primarily commercial real estate loans related to community and private banking activities. (2) At year-end 2001, approximately 17% of these loans were measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral, compared with approximately 25% at year-end 2000. (3) Included in the allowance for credit losses. For the loan portfolios where the Company continues to manage loans after they have been securitized, the following table presents the total loan amounts managed, the portion of those portfolios securitized, and delinquencies (loans which are 90 days or more past due) at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and credit losses, net of recoveries, for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000: (1) Includes loans held for sale. 16
11. ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (1) Includes amounts received under credit default swaps purchased from third parties. (2) Includes the addition of credit loss reserves related to the acquisitions of Banamex and EAB in 2001. Also includes the addition of allowance for credit losses related to other acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translation effects. 12. SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY Citigroup and its subsidiaries securitize primarily credit card receivables, mortgages, home equity loans and auto loans. After securitizations of credit card receivables, the Company continues to maintain credit card customer account relationships and provides servicing for receivables transferred to the trust. The Company also provides credit enhancement to the trust using cash collateral accounts. As specified in certain of the sale agreements, the net revenue collected each month is accumulated up to a predetermined maximum amount, and is available over the remaining term of that transaction to make payments of yield, fees, and transaction costs in the event that net cash flows from the receivables are not sufficient. When the predetermined amount is reached net revenue is passed directly to the Citigroup subsidiary that sold the receivables. The Company provides a wide range of mortgage and home equity products to a diverse customer base. In connection with these loans, the servicing rights entitle the Company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee. Failure to service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees. In non-recourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the servicer is the cost of temporary advances of funds. In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans such as FNMA or FHLMC or with a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing occur primarily when foreclosure sale proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage or home equity loan are less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest of such mortgage loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The following table summarizes certain cash flows received from and paid to securitization trusts during the year ended December 31: (1) Includes mortgages and home equity loans. For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized $271 million and $142 million, respectively, of gains on securitizations of mortgages, home equity loans and auto loans. Key assumptions used for mortgages during the year ended December 31, 2001 in measuring the fair value of retained interests at the date of sale or securitization follow:
Discount rate 5.0% to 15.0% Constant prepayment rate 6.9% to 40.0% Anticipated net credit losses .02% to 5.0%
As required by SFAS 140, the effect of two negative changes in each of the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of retained interests must be disclosed. The negative effect of each change in each assumption must be calculated independently, holding all other assumptions consistent. Because the key assumptions may not in fact be independent, the net effect of simultaneous adverse changes in the key assumptions may be less than the sum of the individual effects shown below. At December 31, 2001, for mortgages, auto loans and manufactured housing loans, the key assumptions, presented by product groups, and the sensitivity of the fair value of retained interests to two adverse changes in each of the key assumptions were as follows: 17
13. DEBT INVESTMENT BANKING AND BROKERAGE BORROWINGS Investment banking and brokerage borrowings and the corresponding weighted average interest rates at December 31 are as follows: Investment banking and brokerage borrowings are short-term in nature and include commercial paper, bank borrowings and other borrowings used to finance Salomon Smith Barney Holdings Inc.'s (Salomon Smith Barney's) operations, including the securities settlement process. Outstanding bank borrowings include both U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar denominated loans. The non-U.S. dollar loans are denominated in multiple currencies including the Japanese yen, German mark, and U.K. sterling. All commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was U.S. dollar denominated. Also included in other are deposit liabilities and other short-term obligations. At December 31, 2001, Salomon Smith Barney had a $5.0 billion, 364-day committed uncollateralized revolving line of credit with unaffiliated banks that extends through May 21, 2002, with repayment on any borrowings due by May 21, 2004. Salomon Smith Barney may borrow under its revolving credit facilities at various interest rate options (LIBOR or base rate) and compensates the banks for the facility through facility fees. Under this facility, Salomon Smith Barney is required to maintain a certain level of consolidated adjusted net worth (as defined in the agreement). At December 31, 2001, this requirement was exceeded by approximately $4.3 billion. At December 31, 2001, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility. Salomon Smith Barney also has substantial borrowing arrangements consisting of facilities that it has been advised are available, but where no contractual lending obligation exists. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS At December 31, short-term borrowings consisted of commercial paper and other borrowings with weighted average interest rates as follows: Citigroup, Citicorp and certain other subsidiaries issue commercial paper directly to investors. Citigroup and Citicorp, both of which are bank holding companies, maintain combined liquidity reserves of cash, securities, and unused bank lines of credit to support their combined outstanding commercial paper. Borrowings under bank lines of credit may be at interest rates based on LIBOR, CD rates, the prime rate or bids submitted by the banks. Each company pays its banks commitment fees for its lines of credit. Citicorp, Salomon Smith Barney, and some of their nonbank subsidiaries have credit facilities with Citicorp's subsidiary banks, including Citibank, N.A. Borrowings under these facilities must be secured in accordance with Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. Citigroup has unutilized bilateral committed revolving credit facilities in the amount of $950 million that expire in 2002. Under these facilities the Company is required to maintain a certain level of consolidated stockholders' equity (as defined in the agreements). The Company exceeded this requirement by approximately $56 billion at December 31, 2001. Associates, a subsidiary of Citicorp, has a combination of unutilized credit facilities of $6.8 billion as of December 31, 2001. These facilities, which have maturities ranging from 2002 to 2005, are all guaranteed by Citicorp. In connection with the facilities for Associates, Citicorp is required to maintain a certain level of consolidated stockholder's equity (as defined in the agreements). At December 31, 2001, this requirement was exceeded by approximately $49 billion. Citicorp has also guaranteed various other debt obligations of Associates and CitiFinancial Credit Company (CCC), an indirect subsidiary of Citicorp. LONG-TERM DEBT (1) Also includes $250 million of notes maturing in 2098. (2) Also includes $1.45 billion of notes maturing between 2025 through 2097. (3) Also includes subordinated debt of $124 million and $145 million at December 31, 2001 and December 2000, respectively. (4) Principally 12% GNMA/FNMA-collateralized obligations. The Company issues both U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed and variable rate debt. The Company utilizes derivative contracts, primarily interest rate swaps, to effectively convert a portion of its fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. The maturity structure of the derivatives generally corresponds with the maturity structure of the debt being hedged. At December 31, 2001, the Company has outstanding interest rate swaps which convert $51.5 billion of its $101.6 billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate obligations. At December 31, 2001, the 18
Company's overall weighted average interest rate for long-term debt was 5.23% on a contractual basis and 4.99% including the effects of derivative contracts. In addition, the Company utilizes other derivative contracts to manage the foreign exchange impact of certain debt issuances. Aggregate annual maturities on long-term debt obligations (based on final maturity dates) are as follows: 14. INSURANCE POLICY AND CLAIMS RESERVES At December 31, insurance policy and claims reserves consisted of the following: (1) Included at December 31, 2001 and 2000 are $1.4 billion of reserves related to workers' compensation that have been discounted using an interest rate of 5%. The following table is a reconciliation of beginning and ending property-casualty reserve balances for claims and claim adjustment expenses for the years ended December 31: The increase in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserve in 2001 from 2000 was primarily due to the impact of the terrorist attack on September 11th, 2001. Partially offsetting the above were net payments of $427 million in 2001 for environmental and cumulative injury claims. The decrease in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves in 2000 from 1999 was primarily attributable to net payments of $341 million, for environmental and cumulative injury claims. In 2001, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims arising in prior years included net favorable loss development on Commercial Lines loss sensitive policies in various lines; however, since the business to which it relates is subject to premium adjustments, there is no impact on results of operations. In addition, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims arising in prior years also included approximately $109 million of net unfavorable development, primarily related to certain Commercial Lines coverages, predominately in general liability, commercial auto liability, assumed reinsurance and specialty businesses, partially offset by favorable development in commercial multi-peril and other claim adjustment expenses. In 2000, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims arising in prior years included approximately $76 million primarily relating to net favorable development in certain Commercial Lines coverages, predominantly in the commercial multi-peril line of business, and in certain Personal Lines coverages, predominately personal umbrella coverages. In addition, in 2000 Commercial Lines experienced favorable loss development on loss sensitive policies in various lines, however, since the business to which it relates is subject to premium adjustments, there is no impact on results of operations. In 1999, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses for claims arising in prior years included approximately $205 million primarily relating to net favorable development in certain Personal Lines coverages, predominantly automobile coverages, and in certain Commercial Lines coverages, predominantly in the general liability and commercial multi-peril lines of business. In addition, in 1999 Commercial Lines experienced favorable loss development on loss sensitive policies in the workers' compensation line; however, since the business to which it relates is subject to premium adjustments, there was no impact on results of operations. The property-casualty claims and claim adjustment expense reserves include $1.216 billion and $1.364 billion for asbestos and environmental-related claims net of reinsurance at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. It is difficult to estimate the reserves for environmental and asbestos-related claims due to the vagaries of court coverage decisions, plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation and other uncertainties, including without limitation, those which are set forth below. Conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate such reserves. In establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each insured and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any, for each insured on a quarterly basis. In the course of this analysis, the Company considers the probable liability, available 19
coverage, relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of similar exposures. In addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as the nature of the alleged activities of the insured at each site; the allegations of environmental harm at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the Company and the insured, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the insured; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims, in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. In establishing the Company's asbestos reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each insured. In the course of this evaluation, the Company considers available insurance coverage including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance issued by the Company to the insured; limits and deductibles; an analysis of each insured's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a product/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim. Once the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and allocated claim adjustment expense is determined for each insured by each policy year, the Company calculates a ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, as well as past ceded experience. Adjustments to the ceded projections also occur due to actual ceded claim experience and reinsurance collections. Historically, the Company's experience has indicated that insureds with potentially significant environmental and/or asbestos exposures often have other cumulative injury other than asbestos (CIOTA) exposures or CIOTA claims pending with the Company. Due to this experience and the fact that settlement agreements with insureds may extinguish the Company's obligations for all claims, the Company evaluates and considers the environmental and asbestos reserves in conjunction with the CIOTA reserve. The Company also compares its historical direct and net loss and expense paid experience year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. The comparison includes a review of the result derived from the division of the ending direct and net reserves by last year's direct and net paid activity, also known as the survival ratio. The reserves carried for environmental and asbestos claims at December 31, 2001 are the Company's best estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses based upon known facts and current law. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue. These include, without limitation, the risks inherent in major litigation, including more aggressive asbestos litigation against insurers, including the Company, any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in asbestos and environmental claims which cannot now be anticipated, the role of any umbrella or excess policies issued by the Company for such claims, whether or not an asbestos claim is a product/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim, the number and outcome of direct actions against the Company and unanticipated developments pertaining to the Company's ability to recover reinsurance for environmental and asbestos claims. It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. Such development will be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation. In addition, particularly during the last few months of 2001 and continuing into 2002, the asbestos-related trends described above have both accelerated and become more visible. These trends include, but are not limited to, the filing of additional claims, more aggressive litigation based on novel theories of liability and litigation against new and previously peripheral defendants, and developments in existing and pending bankruptcy proceedings. Because of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. These additional amounts, or a range of these additional amounts, cannot now be reasonably estimated, and could result in a liability exceeding reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company's operating results in a future period. However, in the opinion of the Company's management, it is not likely that these claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or liquidity. The Company has a geographic exposure to catastrophe losses in certain areas of the United States. Catastrophes can be caused by various events including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, explosions and fires, and the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas, however, hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in large, heavily populated areas. The Company generally seeks to reduce its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. 15. REINSURANCE The Company's insurance operations participate in reinsurance in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to large risks, provide additional capacity for future growth and effect business-sharing arrangements. Life reinsurance is accomplished through various plans of reinsurance, primarily coinsurance, modified coinsurance and yearly renewable term. Property-casualty reinsurance is placed on both a quota-share and excess of loss basis. The property-casualty insurance subsidiaries also participate as a servicing carrier for, and a member of, several pools and associations. Reinsurance ceded arrangements do not discharge the insurance subsidiaries as the primary insurer, except for cases involving a novation. 20
Reinsurance amounts included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the years ended December 31 were as follows: Net premiums related to discontinued operations were $10.010 billion, $9.193 billion, and $8.037 billion in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Additionally, net claims incurred related to discontinued operations were $8.260 billion, $6.469 billion, and $6.057 billion in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of discontinued operations. Reinsurance recoverables, net of valuation allowance, at December 31 include amounts recoverable on unpaid and paid losses and were as follows: 16. RESTRUCTURING- AND MERGER-RELATED ITEMS During 2001, Citigroup recorded restructuring charges of $448 million. Of the $448 million, $319 million related to the downsizing of certain functions in the Global Corporate and Global Consumer businesses in order to align their cost structures with current market conditions and $129 million related to the acquisition of Banamex and the integration of its operations within the Global Consumer business. These restructuring charges were expensed and are included in "Restructuring- and merger-related items" in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In addition, a restructuring reserve of $112 million was recorded in connection with the acquisition of Banamex and recognized as a liability in the purchase price allocation of Banamex. The total Banamex reserves of $241 million include costs related to downsizings, the reconfiguration of branch operations in Mexico, and the integration of operations and operating platforms. These restructuring initiatives are expected to be implemented over the next year. The reserves included $423 million related to employee severance, $72 million related to exiting leasehold and other contractual obligations, and $65 million of asset impairment charges. The $423 million related to employee severance reflects the cost of eliminating approximately 12,500 positions, including 4,200 in Citigroup's Global Consumer business and 3,600 in Banamex related to the acquisition, and 1,300 in the Global Consumer business and 3,400 in the Global Corporate business related to other restructuring initiatives. Approximately 3,200 of these positions were in the United States. The 2001 restructuring reserve utilization included $65 million of asset impairment charges as well as $287 million of severance and other costs (of which $203 million of employee severance and $16 million of leasehold and other exit costs have been paid in cash and $68 is legally obligated), together with translation effects. Through December 31, 2001 approximately 8,600 gross staff positions have been eliminated under these programs. During 2000, Citigroup recorded restructuring charges of $579 million, primarily consisting of exit costs related to the acquisition of Associates. The charges included $241 million related to employee severance, $154 million related to exiting leasehold and other contractual obligations, and $184 million of asset impairment charges. Of the $579 million charge, $474 million related to the acquisition of Associates included the reconfiguration of certain branch operations, the exit from non-strategic businesses and from activities as mandated by Federal bank regulations, and the consolidation and integration of corporate, middle and back office functions. In the Global Consumer business, $51 million includes the reconfiguration of certain branch operations outside the U.S. and the downsizing and consolidation of certain back office functions in the U.S. Approximately $440 million of the $579 million charge related to operations in the United States. The $241 million portion of the charge related to employee severance reflects the costs of eliminating approximately 5,800 positions, including approximately 4,600 in Associates and 700 in the Global Consumer business. Approximately 5,000 of these positions related to the United States. In 2000, an additional reserve of $23 million was recorded, $20 million of which related to the elimination of 1,600 non-U.S. positions of an acquired entity. As of December 31, 2001, the 2000 restructuring reserve utilization included $184 million of asset impairment charges and $302 million of severance and other exit costs (of which $145 million of employee severance and $107 million of leasehold and other exit costs have been paid in cash and $50 million is legally obligated), together with translation effects. The remaining reserve for 2000 restructuring initiatives of $87 million at December 31, 2001 is expected to be substantially utilized by the end of the first quarter of 2002. Through December 31, 2001, approximately 5,450 staff positions have been eliminated under these programs. During 2000, the Company also recorded $177 million of merger-related costs which included legal, advisory, and SEC filing fees, as well as other costs of administratively closing the acquisition of Associates. In 1999, Citigroup recorded restructuring charges of $166 million, including additional severance charges of $49 million as a result of the continued implementation of 1998 restructuring initiatives, as well as $82 million of exit costs associated with new initiatives in the Global 21
Consumer business primarily related to the reconfiguration of certain branch operations outside the U.S., the downsizing of certain marketing operations, and the exit of a non-strategic business. The 1999 restructuring reserve was fully utilized at June 30, 2000. The 1999 charge included $35 million of integration charges recorded by Associates (the Avco charge) related to its January 6, 1999 acquisition of Avco Financial Services, Inc. (Avco). In addition to the Avco charge, as part of the purchase price allocation of the Avco acquisition, Associates recorded a $146 million reserve at the time of the acquisition. This reserve was established to reflect the costs of exiting certain activities that would not be continued after the acquisition. The costs primarily consisted of severance costs and related expenses, lease termination costs and other contractual liabilities. The Avco reserve was fully utilized at December 31, 1999. The implementation of these restructuring initiatives also caused certain related premises and equipment assets to become redundant. The remaining depreciable lives of these assets were shortened, and accelerated depreciation charges (in addition to normal scheduled depreciation on those assets) of $63 million, $68 million and $182 million were recognized in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The status of the 2001, 2000, and 1999 restructuring initiatives is summarized in the following table: RESTRUCTURING RESERVE ACTIVITY (1) Represents additions to restructuring liabilities arising from acquisitions. (2) Utilization amounts include translation effects on the restructuring reserve. Changes in estimates are attributable to facts and circumstances arising subsequent to an original restructuring charge. Changes in estimates attributable to lower than anticipated costs of implementing certain projects and a reduction in the scope of certain initiatives during 2001 resulted in the reduction of the reserve for 2001 restructuring initiatives of $18 million, a reduction of $29 million for 2000 restructuring initiatives and a reduction of $6 million for 1998 and 1997 restructuring initiatives. During 2000 and 1999, changes in estimates resulted in reductions in the reserve for 1998 restructuring initiatives of $65 million and $151 million, respectively. Changes in estimates related to 1997 restructuring initiatives, which were fully utilized as of December 31, 1999, were $250 million in 1999, and were primarily related to the reassessment of space needed due to the Travelers and Citicorp merger, which indicated the need for increased occupancy and the utilization of space previously considered excessive. 17. INCOME TAXES (1) Includes the effect of securities transactions resulting in a provision of $202 million in 2001, $282 million in 2000, and $189 million in 1999. The reconciliation of the Federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective income tax rate applicable to income (before minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes) for the years ended December 31 was as follows: 22
Deferred income taxes at December 31 related to the following: Foreign pretax earnings approximated $8.1 billion in 2001, $6.9 billion in 2000, and $5.4 billion in 1999. As a U.S. corporation, Citigroup is subject to U.S. taxation currently on all foreign pretax earnings earned by a foreign branch. Pretax earnings of a foreign subsidiary or affiliate are subject to U.S. taxation when effectively repatriated. In addition, certain of Citigroup's U.S. income is subject to foreign income tax where the payor of such income is domiciled outside the United States. The Company provides income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries except to the extent that such earnings are indefinitely invested outside the United States. At December 31, 2001, $2.0 billion of accumulated undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries was indefinitely invested. At the existing U.S. Federal income tax rate, additional taxes of $565 million would have to be provided if such earnings were remitted. Income taxes are not provided for on the Company's life insurance subsidiaries' "policyholders' surplus account" because under current U.S. tax rules such taxes will become payable only to the extent such amounts are distributed as a dividend or exceed limits prescribed by Federal law. Distributions are not contemplated from this account, which aggregated $982 million (subject to a tax of $344 million) at December 31, 2001. The 2001 net change in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets was a decrease of $20 million primarily relating to state net operating losses. The valuation allowance of $200 million at December 31, 2001 is primarily related to specific state and local, and foreign tax carryforwards, or tax law restrictions on benefit recognition in the U.S. Federal tax return and in the above jurisdictions. Management believes that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $3.880 billion is more likely than not based on existing carryback ability and expectations as to future taxable income. The Company has reported pretax financial statement income of approximately $20 billion, on average, over the last three years and has generated Federal taxable income exceeding $13 billion, on average, each year during this same period. 18. MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS The Company formed statutory business trusts under the laws of the state of Delaware, which exist for the exclusive purposes of (i) issuing Trust Securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust; (ii) investing the gross proceeds of the Trust securities in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures (subordinated debentures) of its parent; and (iii) engaging in only those activities necessary or incidental thereto. Upon approval from the Federal Reserve, Citigroup has the right to redeem these securities. These subordinated debentures and the related income effects are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Distributions on the mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts below have been classified as interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 23
The following tables summarize the financial structure of each of the Company's subsidiary trusts at December 31, 2001: In each case, the coupon rate on the debentures is the same as that on the trust securities. Distributions on the trust securities and interest on the debentures are payable quarterly, except for Citigroup Capital II and III and Citicorp Capital I and II, on which distributions are payable semiannually. On January 7, 2002, Citigroup redeemed, for cash, all of the Trust Preferred Securities of Citigroup Capital I at the redemption price of $25 per Preferred Security plus any accrued and unpaid distributions thereon. 19. PREFERRED STOCK AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK The following table sets forth the Company's perpetual preferred stock outstanding at December 31: (1) Under various circumstances, the Company may redeem certain series of preferred stock at times other than described above. (2) Liquidation preference per share equals redemption price per share. (3) Issued as depositary shares, each representing a one-fifth interest in a share of the corresponding series of preferred stock. (4) Issued as depositary shares, each representing a one-twentieth interest in a share of the corresponding series of preferred stock. (5) Issued as depositary shares, each representing a one-tenth interest in a share of the corresponding series of preferred stock. (6) Shares previously held by affiliates in 2001 have been subsequently traded on the open market to third parties during the third quarter of 2001. All dividends on the Company's perpetual preferred stock are payable quarterly and are cumulative. Citigroup redeemed Series K Preferred Stock in October 2001. In January 2002, Citigroup redeemed Series U Preferred Stock. Dividends on Series Q and R Preferred Stock are payable at rates determined quarterly by formulas based on interest rates of certain U.S. Treasury obligations, subject to certain minimum and maximum rates as specified in the certificates of designation. The weighted-average 24
dividend rate on the Series Q and R Preferred Stock was 4.83% for 2001. Dividends on the Series V Preferred Stock are payable at 5.86% through February 15, 2006, and thereafter at rates determined quarterly by a formula based on certain interest rate indices, subject to a minimum rate of 6% and a maximum rate of 12%. The rate of dividends on the Series V Preferred Stock is subject to adjustment based upon the applicable percentage of the dividends received deduction. REGULATORY CAPITAL Citigroup and Citicorp are subject to risk-based capital and leverage guidelines issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), and their U.S. insured depository institution subsidiaries, including Citibank, N.A., are subject to similar guidelines issued by their respective primary regulators. These guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and include the required minimums shown in the following table. To be "well capitalized" under Federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a depository institution must have a Tier 1 ratio of at least 6%, a combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 ratio of at least 10%, and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and not be subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. The regulatory agencies are required by law to take specific prompt actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, all of Citigroup's U.S. insured subsidiary depository institutions were "well capitalized." At December 31, 2001, regulatory capital as set forth in guidelines issued by the U.S. Federal bank regulators is as follows: (1) Total capital includes Tier 1 and Tier 2. (2) Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average assets. There are various legal limitations on the extent to which Citigroup's banking subsidiaries may pay dividends to their parents. Citigroup's national and state-chartered bank subsidiaries can declare dividends to their respective parent companies in 2002, without regulatory approval, of approximately $9.1 billion adjusted by the effect of their net income (loss) for 2002 up to the date of any such dividend declaration. In determining whether and to what extent to pay dividends, each bank subsidiary must also consider the effect of dividend payments on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements as well as policy statements of the Federal regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Consistent with these considerations, Citigroup estimates that its bank subsidiaries can distribute dividends to Citigroup of approximately $8.9 billion of the available $9.1 billion, adjusted by the effect of their net income (loss) up to the date of any such dividend declaration. The property-casualty insurance subsidiaries' statutory capital and surplus at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $7.687 billion and $7.634 billion, respectively. The life insurance subsidiaries' statutory capital and surplus at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $6.188 billion and $6.079 billion, respectively. Statutory capital and surplus are subject to certain restrictions imposed by state insurance departments as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends. The property-casualty insurance subsidiaries' statutory net income for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $1.091 billion, $1.445 billion and $1.500 billion, respectively. The life insurance subsidiaries' statutory net income for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $471 million, $1.090 billion and $988 million, respectively. Statutory capital and surplus and statutory net income are determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. TIC is subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum amount of dividends available to its parent without prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department. A maximum of $586 million of statutory surplus is available by the end of the year 2002 for such dividends without the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department. TPC's insurance subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum amount of dividends available to be paid to their parent without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities. A maximum of $1.0 billion is available by the end of 2002 for such dividends without prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department. However, the payment of a significant portion of this amount is likely to be subject to such approval depending upon the amount and timing of the payments. Certain of the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to various securities and commodities regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate. The principal regulated subsidiaries, their net capital requirement or equivalent and excess over the minimum requirement as of December 31, 2001 are as follows: 25
20. CHANGES IN EQUITY FROM NONOWNER SOURCES Changes in each component of "Accumulated Other Changes in Equity from Nonowner Sources" for the three-year period ended December 31, 2001 are as follows: (1) Refers to the 2001 first quarter adoption of SFAS 133 and the 2001 second quarter adoption of EITF 99-20. 46
21. EARNINGS PER SHARE The following is a reconciliation of the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the years ended December 31: During 2001, 2000 and 1999, weighted average options of 100.1 million shares, 28.1 million shares and 42.7 million shares with weighted average exercise prices of $52.76 per share, $58.32 per share, and $40.81 per share, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company's common stock. 22. INCENTIVE PLANS The Company has adopted a number of equity compensation plans under which it administers stock options, restricted/deferred stock and stock purchase programs to attract, retain and motivate officers and employees, to compensate them for their contributions to the growth and profits of the Company, and to encourage employee stock ownership. At December 31, 2001, approximately 450 million shares were authorized for grant under Citigroup's stock incentive plans. STOCK OPTION PROGRAMS The Company has a number of stock option programs that provide for the granting of stock options to officers and employees. Options are granted at the fair market value of Citigroup common stock at the time of grant for a period of ten years. Generally, Citigroup options vest over a five-year period, including options granted under Travelers predecessor plans and options granted since the date of the merger. Generally, 50% of the options granted under Citicorp predecessor plans prior to the merger are exercisable beginning on the third anniversary and 50% beginning on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant. Generally, options granted under Associates predecessor plans vest over a three-year period. Certain options permit an employee exercising an option under certain conditions to be granted new options (reload options) in an amount equal to the number of common shares used to satisfy the exercise price and the withholding taxes due upon exercise. The reload options are granted for the remaining term of the related original option and vest after six months. To further encourage employee stock ownership, the Company's eligible employees participate in WealthBuilder, Citibuilder, or the new Citigroup Ownership stock option programs. Commencing in 2001, new grants are made under the Citigroup Ownership Program. Options granted under the WealthBuilder and the Citigroup Ownership programs vest over a five-year period, whereas options granted under the Citibuilder program vest after five years. These options do not have a reload feature. During 1998, a group of key Citicorp employees were granted 12,680,000 performance-based stock options at an equivalent Citigroup strike price of $24.13. These performance-based options vested in 1999 when Citigroup's stock price reached $40.00 per share. The cost of performance-based options was measured as the difference between the exercise price and the market price required for vesting. After-tax expense recognized on these performance-based options was $68 million in 1999. All of the expense related to these grants has been recognized. Information with respect to stock option activity under Citigroup stock option plans for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 is as follows: 27
The following table summarizes the information about stock options outstanding under Citigroup stock option plans at December 31, 2001: THE RESTRICTED STOCK PROGRAM The Company, primarily through its Capital Accumulation Program (CAP), issues shares of Citigroup common stock in the form of restricted stock to participating officers and employees. The restricted stock generally vests after a two- or three-year restricted period during which time the stock cannot be sold or transferred by the participant and is subject to total or partial forfeiture if the participant's employment is terminated. Certain CAP participants may elect to receive part of their awards in restricted stock and part in stock options. The figures in the two previous tables include options granted under CAP. Unearned compensation expense associated with the restricted stock grants represents the market value of Citigroup common stock at the date of grant and is recognized as a charge to income ratably over the vesting period. Information with respect to restricted stock awards is as follows: CITIGROUP 401(k) Under the Citigroup 401(k) plan, eligible employees receive awards up to 3% of their total compensation deferred into the Citigroup common stock fund. The after-tax expense associated with this plan amounted to $32 million in 2001, $29 million in 2000 and $31 million in 1999. STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM Stock Purchase Program offerings, which are administered under the Citigroup 2000 Stock Purchase Plan and the Citicorp 1997 Stock Incentive Plan allow eligible employees of Citigroup to enter into fixed subscription agreements to purchase shares in the future at the market value on the date of the agreements. Subject to certain limits, enrolled employees are permitted to make one purchase prior to the expiration date. The purchase price of the shares is paid with accumulated payroll deductions plus interest. Shares of Citigroup's common stock to be delivered under the Stock Purchase Program may be sourced from authorized and unissued or treasury shares. The original offering under the Citigroup Stock Purchase Program was in August 2000. In 2001, three additional offerings were made to new employees in March, July and November 2001. A previous offering under the 1997 Stock Purchase Plan allowed eligible employees of Citicorp to enter into fixed subscription agreements to purchase shares at the market value on the date of the agreements. Such shares could be purchased from time to time through the expiration date. Shares of Citigroup's common stock delivered under the Stock Purchase Plan were sourced from treasury shares. Following is the share activity under the August 2000 and 1997 fixed-price offerings for the purchase of shares at the equivalent Citigroup price of $52.92 and $22.65 per share, respectively. The fixed-price offerings for the purchase of shares for the offerings made in March, July, and November 2001 were $44.98, $50.21 and $45.52, respectively. The 1997 offering expired on June 30, 1999. All current offerings will expire in September 2002. PRO FORMA IMPACT OF SFAS NO. 123 The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans under which there is generally no charge to earnings for employee stock option awards (other than performance-based options) and the dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share. Alternatively, FASB rules would permit a method under which a compensation cost for all stock awards would be calculated and recognized over the service period (generally equal to the vesting period). This compensation cost would be determined in a manner prescribed by FASB using option pricing models, intended to estimate the fair value of the awards at the grant date. Earnings per share dilution would be recognized as well. Under both methods, an offsetting increase to stockholders' equity is recorded equal to the amount of compensation expense charged. 28
Had the Company applied SFAS No. 123 in accounting for the Company's stock option plans, net income and net income per share would have been the pro forma amounts indicated below: The pro forma adjustments relate to stock options granted from 1995 through 2001, for which a fair value on the date of grant was determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. No effect has been given to options granted prior to 1995. The fair values of stock-based awards are based on assumptions that were determined at the grant date. SFAS No. 123 requires that reload options be treated as separate grants from the related original grants. Under the Company's reload program, upon exercise of an option, employees tender previously owned shares to pay the exercise price and surrender shares otherwise to be received for related tax withholding, and receive a reload option covering the same number of shares tendered for such purposes. Reload options vest at the end of a six-month period. Reload options are intended to encourage employees to exercise options at an earlier date and to retain the shares so acquired, in furtherance of the Company's long-standing policy of encouraging increased employee stock ownership. The result of this program is that employees generally will exercise options as soon as they are able and, therefore, these options have shorter expected lives. Shorter option lives result in lower valuations using a Black-Scholes option model. However, such values are expensed more quickly due to the shorter vesting period of reload options. In addition, since reload options are treated as separate grants, the existence of the reload feature results in a greater number of options being valued. Shares received through option exercises under the reload program are subject to restrictions on sale. Discounts (as measured by the estimated cost of protection) have been applied to the fair value of options granted to reflect these sale restrictions. Additional valuation and related assumption information for Citigroup option plans is presented below: 23. RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company has several non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and has various defined benefit pension termination indemnity plans covering employees outside the United States. The U.S. defined benefit plan provides benefits under a cash balance formula. Employees satisfying certain age and service requirements remain covered by a prior final pay formula. The Company also offers postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible U.S. retired employees, as well as to certain eligible employees outside the United States. The following tables summarize the components of net benefit expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income and the funded status and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the Company's U.S. plans and significant plans outside the United States. NET BENEFIT EXPENSE (1) For plans outside the U.S., net postretirement benefit expense totaled $42 million in 2001, $13 million in 2000, and $13 million in 1999. 29
PREPAID BENEFIT COST (BENEFIT LIABILITY) (1) For unfunded U.S. plans, the aggregate benefit obligation was $547 million and $537 million, and the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation was $512 million and $475 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. (2) For plans outside the U.S., the aggregate benefit obligation was $2.378 billion and $1.175 billion, and the fair value of plan assets was $1.877 billion and $700 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, for plans whose benefit obligation exceeds plan assets. The aggregate accumulated benefit obligation was $670 million and $440 million, and the fair value of plan assets was $324 million and $167 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, for plans whose accumulated benefit obligation exceeds plan assets. (3) For plans outside the U.S., the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was $524 million and $88 million and the postretirement benefit liability was $519 million and $44 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 30
The expected long-term rates of return on assets used in determining the Company's pension and postretirement expense are shown below: (1) Excluding highly inflationary countries. The principal assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement benefit obligations for the Company's plans are shown in the following table. (1) Excluding highly inflationary countries. As an indicator of sensitivity, increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 1% in each year would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2001 by $38 million and the aggregate of the benefits earned and interest components of 2001 net postretirement benefit expense by $5 million. Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 1% in each year would have decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2001 by $35 million and the aggregate of the benefits earned and interest components of 2001 net postretirement benefit expense by $4 million. 24. DERIVATIVES AND OTHER ACTIVITIES The following table summarizes certain information related to the Company's hedging activities for the year ended December 31, 2001: Additionally, $313 million of net gains is expected to be reclassified from accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources within twelve months from December 31, 2001. The accumulated other changes in equity from nonowner sources from cash flow hedges for 2001 can be summarized as follows (net of taxes): (1) Results from the cumulative effect of accounting change for cash flow hedges. Citigroup enters into derivative and foreign exchange futures, forwards, options and swaps, which enable customers to transfer, modify or reduce their interest rate, foreign exchange and other market risks, and also trades these products for its own account. In addition, Citigroup uses derivatives and other instruments, primarily interest rate products, as an end-user in connection with its risk management activities. Derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk relating to specific groups of on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, including investments, corporate and consumer loans, deposit liabilities, long-term debt and other interest-sensitive assets and liabilities, as well as credit card securitizations, redemptions and sales. In addition, foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated debt, net capital exposures and foreign exchange transactions. Futures and forward contracts are commitments to buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument, commodity or currency at a contracted price and may be settled in cash or through delivery. Swap contracts are commitments to settle in cash at a future date or dates which may range from a few days to a number of years, based on differentials between specified financial indices, as applied to a notional principal amount. Option contracts give the purchaser, for a fee, the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell within a limited time, a financial instrument or currency at a contracted price that may also be settled in cash, based on differentials between specified indices. Citigroup also sells various financial instruments that have not been purchased (short sales). In order to sell securities short, the securities are borrowed or received as collateral in conjunction with short-term financing agreements and, at a later date, must be delivered (i.e. replaced) with like or substantially the same financial instruments or commodities to the parties from which they were originally borrowed. Derivatives and short sales may expose Citigroup to market risk or credit risk in excess of the amounts recorded on the balance sheet. Market risk on a derivative, short sale or foreign exchange product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and other values, and is a function of the type of product, the volume of transactions, the tenor and terms of the agreement, and the underlying volatility. Credit risk is the exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the transaction and if the value of collateral held, if any, was not adequate to cover such losses. The recognition in earnings of unrealized gains on these transactions is subject to management's assessment as to collectibility. Liquidity risk is the potential exposure that arises when the size of the derivative position may not be able to be rapidly adjusted in times of high volatility and financial stress at a reasonable cost. 25. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to Citigroup's total credit exposure. Although Citigroup's portfolio of financial 31
instruments is broadly diversified along industry, product, and geographic lines, material transactions are completed with other financial institutions, particularly in the securities trading, derivative, and foreign exchange businesses. 26. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The table presents the carrying value and fair value of Citigroup's financial instruments, as defined in accordance with applicable requirements. Accordingly, as required, the disclosures exclude leases, affiliate investments, and pension and benefit obligations. Contractholder funds amounts exclude certain insurance contracts. Also as required, the disclosures exclude the effect of taxes, do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular instrument, the excess fair value associated with deposits with no fixed maturity, as well as other expenses that would be incurred in a market transaction. In addition, the table excludes the values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, as well as a wide range of franchise, relationship, and intangible values, which are integral to a full assessment of Citigroup's financial position and the value of its net assets. The data represents management's best estimates based on a range of methodologies and assumptions. The carrying value of short-term financial instruments as well as receivables and payables arising in the ordinary course of business, approximates fair value because of the relatively short period of time between their origination and expected realization. Quoted market prices are used for most investments, for loans where available, and for both trading and end-user derivatives, as well as for liabilities, such as long-term debt, with quoted prices. For performing loans where no quoted market prices are available, contractual cash flows are discounted at quoted secondary market rates or estimated market rates if available. Otherwise, sales of comparable loan portfolios or current market origination rates for loans with similar terms and risk characteristics are used. For loans with doubt as to collectibility, expected cash flows are discounted using an appropriate rate considering the time of collection and a premium for the uncertainty of the flows. The value of collateral is also considered. For liabilities such as long-term debt without quoted market prices, market borrowing rates of interest are used to discount contractual cash flows. Fair values of credit card securitizations reflect the various components of these transactions but principally arise from fixed rates payable to certificate holders. Under the applicable requirements, the estimated fair value of deposits with no fixed maturity in the following table excludes the premium values available in the market for such deposits, and the estimated value is shown in the table as being equal to the carrying value. (1) The carrying value of loans is net of the allowance for credit losses and also excludes $22.7 billion and $20.0 billion of lease finance receivables in 2001 and 2000, respectively. (2) Includes cash and due from banks, deposits at interest with banks, brokerage receivables, reinsurance recoverables and separate and variable accounts for which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value, and the carrying value and estimated fair value of financial instruments included in other assets on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. (3) Includes brokerage payables, separate and variable accounts, investment banking and brokerage borrowings, short-term borrowings, for which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value, and the carrying value and estimated fair value of financial instruments included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Fair values vary from period to period based on changes in a wide range of factors, including interest rates, credit quality, and market perceptions of value, and as existing assets and liabilities run off and new items are entered into. The estimated fair values of loans reflect changes in credit status since the loans were made, changes in interest rates in the case of fixed-rate loans, and premium values at origination of certain loans. The estimated fair values of Citigroup's loans, in the aggregate, exceeded carrying values (reduced by the allowance for credit losses) by $15.5 billion at year-end 2001 and $13.0 billion in 2000. Within these totals, estimated fair values exceeded carrying values for consumer loans net of the allowance by $10.9 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion from year-end 2000, and for corporate loans net of the allowance by $4.6 billion, which was an increase of $1.0 billion from year-end 2000. The increase in estimated fair values in excess of carrying values of consumer loans and corporate loans is primarily due to the lower interest rate environment in 2001. The estimated fair value of credit card securitizations, which are included with other financial assets in the table above, was $0.3 billion less than their carrying value at December 31, 2001, which is $0.6 billion less than December 31, 2000, when the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by $0.3 billion. This decrease is due to the effects of a lower interest rate environment on the fixed-rate investor certificates. 32
For 2001, all end-user derivative contracts, which are included in other assets and other liabilities in the previous table, are carried at fair value. At December 31, 2000 the gross difference between the fair value and carrying amount was $0.8 billion for contracts whose fair value exceeds carrying value, and $0.5 billion for contracts whose carrying value exceeds fair value. 27. PLEDGED ASSETS, COLLATERAL AND COMMITMENTS PLEDGED ASSETS At December 31, 2001 and 2000 the approximate market values of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other assets pledged, excluding the impact of FIN 39 and FIN 41 were as follows: In addition, included in cash and due from banks at December 31, 2001 and 2000 is $5.3 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, of cash segregated under Federal and other brokerage regulations or deposited with clearing organizations. At December 31, 2001 the Company had $975 million of outstanding letters of credit from banks to satisfy various collateral and margin requirements. COLLATERAL At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the approximate market value of collateral received by the Company that may be sold or repledged by the Company, excluding amounts netted in accordance with FIN 39 and FIN 41, was $245.0 billion and $236.6 billion, respectively. This collateral was received in connection with resale agreements, securities borrowings and loans, derivative transactions, and margined broker loans. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, a substantial portion of the collateral received by the Company had been sold or repledged in connection with repurchase agreements, securities sold, not yet purchased, securities borrowings and loans, pledges to clearing organizations, segregation requirements under securities laws and regulations, derivative transactions, and bank loans. In addition, at December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had pledged $47.5 billion and $47.5 billion, respectively, of collateral that may not be sold or repledged by the secured parties. LEASE COMMITMENTS Rental expense (principally for offices and computer equipment) was $1.7 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Future minimum annual rentals under noncancelable leases, net of sublease income, are as follows: The Company and certain of Salomon Smith Barney's subsidiaries together have an option to purchase the buildings presently leased for Salomon Smith Barney's executive offices and New York City operations at the expiration of the lease term. LOAN COMMITMENTS (1) Includes commercial commitments to make or purchase loans, to purchase third-party receivables, and to provide note issuance or revolving underwriting facilities. The majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards. Corporate commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees. Such fees (net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the commitment, amortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed remote, amortized over the commitment period. The table does not include commercial letters of credit issued on behalf of customers and collateralized by the underlying shipment of goods which totaled $5.7 billion and $6.8 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000. 33
LOANS SOLD WITH CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS (1) Residential mortgages represent 57% of amounts in 2001 and 71% in 2000. (2) Government National Mortgage Association sales/servicing agreements covering securitized residential mortgages. Citigroup and its subsidiaries are obligated under various credit enhancements related to certain sales of loans or sales of participations in pools of loans, as summarized above. Net revenue on securitized credit card receivables is collected over the life of each sale transaction. The net revenue is based upon the sum of finance charges and fees received from cardholders and interchange revenue earned on cardholder transactions, less the sum of the yield paid to investors, credit losses, transaction costs, and a contractual servicing fee, which is also retained by certain Citigroup subsidiaries as servicers. As specified in certain of the sale agreements, the net revenue collected each month is accumulated up to a predetermined maximum amount, and is available over the remaining term of that transaction to make payments of yield, fees, and transaction costs in the event that net cash flows from the receivables are not sufficient. When the predetermined amount is reached, net revenue is passed directly to the Citigroup subsidiary that sold the receivables. The amount contained in these accounts is included in other assets and was $139 million at December 31, 2001 and $66 million at December 31, 2000. Net revenue from securitized credit card receivables included in other revenue was $2.1 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Various put options were written during 2000 and 1999 which require Citigroup to purchase, upon request of the holders, securities issued in certain securitization transactions in order to broaden the investor base and improve execution in connection with the securitizations. The put option at year-end 2001 is exercisable in October of each year beginning in October 2000, with respect to an aggregate of up to approximately $2 billion principal amount of certificates backed by manufactured housing contract receivables, of which approximately $133 million was exercised in 2000. If exercised, the Company will be obligated to purchase the certificates or notes at par plus accrued interest. Two option contracts from 2000 that were exercised in 2001 were the following: a put option, exercisable at any time after June 15, 2000, with respect to an aggregate of up to approximately $1 billion principal amount of notes secured by home equity loan receivables only to the extent the securitization trust cannot meet its obligation under a separate put option by the trust which is exercisable at any time after March 15, 2000; and a put option, originally exercisable at any time after September 15, 2000, the exercise of which had been extended to April 12, 2001, with respect to an aggregate of up to approximately $1.25 billion of notes secured by home equity loan receivables only to the extent the notes are not purchased by the securitization trust pursuant to a separate put option issued by the trust and exercisable at any time after June 15, 2000. The aggregate amortized amount of these options was approximately $1.4 billion at December 31, 2001 and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2000. The Company has recorded liabilities totaling approximately $6 million at December 31, 2001 and $17 million at December 31, 2000 in connection with these options. Subsequent to their initial issuance, such options are marked to market with the fluctuation being reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Income. FINANCIAL GUARANTEES Financial guarantees are used in various transactions to enhance the credit standing of Citigroup customers. They represent irrevocable assurances, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, that Citigroup will make payment in the event that the customer fails to fulfill its obligations to third parties. Citicorp issues financial standby letters of credit which are obligations to pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer fails to repay an outstanding loan or debt instrument, such as assuring payments by a foreign reinsurer to a U.S. insurer, to act as a substitute for an escrow account, to provide a payment mechanism for a customer's third-party obligations, and to assure payment of specified financial obligations of a customer. Fees are recognized ratably over the term of the standby letter of credit. The following table summarizes financial standby letters of credit issued by Citicorp. The table does not include securities lending indemnifications issued to customers, which are fully collateralized and totaled $19.9 billion at December 31, 2001 and $15.5 billion at December 31, 2000, and performance standby letters of credit. (1) Total is net of cash collateral of $2.2 billion in 2001 and $2.0 billion in 2000. Collateral other than cash covered 30% of the total in 2001 and 24% in 2000. OTHER COMMITMENTS Salomon Smith Barney and a principal broker-dealer subsidiary have each provided a portion of a residual value guarantee in the amount of $77 million in connection with the lease of the buildings occupied by Salomon Smith Barney's executive offices and New York operations. 28. CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup and/or its subsidiaries are defendants or co-defendants in various litigation matters, other than environmental and asbestos property and casualty insurance claims as discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Although there can be no assurances, the Company believes, based on information currently available, that the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 34
