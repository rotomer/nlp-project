EXHIBIT 99.01 CITIGROUP - FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (1) On August 20, 2002, Citigroup completed the distribution to its stockholders of a majority portion of its remaining ownership interest in Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC). As required by SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", the results of TPC are reported in the Company's Statement of Income separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the Statement of Consolidated Financial Position has not been restated. TPC represented the primary vehicle by which Citigroup engaged in the property and casualty insurance business. (2) Accounting changes in 2002 of ($47) million include the adoption of the remaining provisions of SFAS 142. Accounting changes in 2001 include ($42) million and ($116) million relating to the adoption of SFAS 133 and EITF 99-20, respectively. Accounting changes in 1999 include the adoption of SOP 97-3 of ($135) million, SOP 98-7 of $23 million and SOP 98-5 of ($15) million. (3) Revenues, Net of Interest Expense, and Benefits, Claims, and Credit Losses are disclosed on an owned basis (under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)). If this table were prepared on a managed basis, which includes certain effects of securitization activities including receivables held for securitization and receivables sold with servicing retained, there would be no impact to net income, but revenues, net of interest expense, and benefits, claims, and credit losses would each have been increased by $4.123 billion, $3.568 billion, $2.459 billion, $2.707 billion, $2.364 billion and $1.734 billion in 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. Although a managed basis presentation is not in conformity with GAAP, it provides a representation of performance and key indicators of the credit-card business that is consistent with the view the Company uses to manage the business. (4) Includes TPC employees prior to 2002.
