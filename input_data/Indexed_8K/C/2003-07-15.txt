In addition, the companies signed a multi-year marketing and servicing agreement across a range of each company's businesses, products and services. The acquisition will provide sustained value and growth opportunities for both Citigroup and Sears. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Citigroup earnings in the first year and is expected to close by year-end, subject to applicable regulatory approvals. Sears' credit card business includes 59 million total accounts, of which 25 million are active. This portfolio represents the 8th largest in the United States and includes the largest remaining in-house private label portfolio. "This acquisition provides us with an opportunity to take a leadership position in the private label segment and solidify our current bankcard leadership position," said Sanford I. Weill, Citigroup chairman and chief executive officer. "This relationship with Sears gives us unique access to a large distribution channel and customer base. We look forward to growing the value and profitability of this portfolio by applying our expertise. We have demonstrated our capability at integrating new businesses over the last few years and to add to our bottom line. This acquisition should be no different." "This transaction creates significant growth opportunities for Citigroup in this segment of our business," said Robert B. Willumstad, president of Citigroup and chairman and chief executive officer of Citigroup's Global Consumer Group. "Sears is a unique franchise as 60 percent of U.S. households are Sears customers, including a significant Hispanic
customer base -- a key focus of our consumer business marketing efforts. Through over 2,700 Sears outlets across the U.S., we will have access to low cost, high volume customer acquisition points that currently add over four million credit card customers annually." "Our excellent analytic and risk management capabilities, along with our expertise as a low-cost producer have made us the leader in the card industry. This transaction strengthens our multi-brand approach to consumers and extends the customer base for cross-selling opportunities of other Citi products. We will provide Sears' cardholders with excellent products and services and intend to enhance the portfolio, making it even stronger by leveraging our proven ability to integrate and maximize significant credit card businesses," concluded Mr. Willumstad. "We're pleased that Citigroup has recognized the value of Sears' successful credit and financial products business, as well as the benefit of an ongoing alliance," said Alan J. Lacy, Sears chairman and chief executive officer. "The alliance will create ongoing value, not only for both companies and their shareholders, but also for Sears customers. This transaction allows Sears to focus on our core business of serving our customers' home and family needs while complementing our strong offerings with Citigroup's outstanding financial services." Both companies said that there will be no immediate changes to the Sears card programs or operations. Customers will be provided with uninterrupted service and should continue to use their cards in the same manner they do today.
