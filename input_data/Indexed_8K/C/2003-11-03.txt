In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the Statement of Consolidated Financial Position has not been restated. TPC represented the primary vehicle by which Citigroup engaged in the property and casualty insurance business.

CITIGROUP Segment Revenues, Net of Interest Expense Product View
(In millions of dollars)
(1)
Segment net revenues disclosed above are prepared on an owned basis in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The managed basis disclosures treat the receivables as if they had not been securitized and are still on our balance sheet, reflecting the interest revenue and expense associated with the portfolio, as well as the credit costs incurred. Although a managed basis presentation is not in conformity with GAAP, the Company believes it provides a representation of performance and key indicators of the credit card business that is consistent with the way the business is managed. For a reconciliation of managed basis revenue to GAAP revenues, see the Cards business.

CITIGROUP GLOBAL CONSUMER Cards
(In millions of dollars)
(1)
The abbreviated income statement presented above is prepared on a managed basis (a non-GAAP measure), and includes the effect of securitizations in Adjusted Revenues, Net of Interest Expense and Adjusted Provision for Credit Losses. This income statement reconciles to Income from Continuing Operations which is a GAAP measure. Securitization changes Citigroup's role from that of a lender to that of a loan servicer and removes the receivables from Citigroup's balance sheet. For securitized receivables, amounts that would otherwise be reported as net interest revenue, fee and commission revenue, and credit losses are instead components of the servicing fees earned. However, Citigroup's exposure to credit losses on the securitized receivables is contractually limited to the cash flows from the receivables. The managed basis disclosures treat the receivables as if they had not been securitized and are still on the Company's balance sheet, with related income statement amounts reported as net interest revenue, fee and commission revenue, and credit losses. Although a managed basis presentation is not in conformity with GAAP, the Company believes it provides a representation of performance and key indicators of the credit card business that is consistent with the way management reviews operating performance and allocates resources. Furthermore, investors utilize information about the credit quality of the entire managed portfolio as the results of both the held and securitized portfolios impact the overall performance of the cards business.
