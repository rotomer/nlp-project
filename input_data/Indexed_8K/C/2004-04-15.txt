        New York, NY, April 15, 2004Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) today reported record net income for the three months ended March 31, 2004 of $5.27 billion, a 29% increase over the first quarter of 2003. Earnings per diluted share of $1.01 represented a 28% increase over the prior year period. Results included a $180 million after-tax gain, or approximately $0.03 per share, from the sale of a portion of the company's electronic funds services business.
        "Citigroup's record first quarter performance demonstrates our unique ability to capitalize on the continued strengthening of the global economy. We achieved double-digit income growth in each of our nine products as well as in every one of our regions," said Charles Prince, Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup. "Our results reflect a focus on increasing customer volumes while maintaining expense discipline and improving credit performance. Customer activity remained strong. Globally, managed card receivables increased 23% and retail bank deposits exceeded $250 billion globally. Client assets for Private Client Services reached nearly $1.1 trillion, rising 23%. Our Global Corporate and Investment Bank maintained the number one position in global debt and equity underwriting, and we were pleased with the increasing momentum of our global equities business. Our Investment Management businesses also experienced strong customer flows with assets under management increasing 15% to $530 billion, Private Bank client volumes up 17% to exceed $200 billion, and Life Insurance and Annuities business volumes up 26% to a record $73 billion. Citigroup International's income advanced 32%, with record income of $599 million in Asia and nearly $500 million in EMEA. In addition to our strong organic growth, we continue to make targeted acquisitions to build out our franchise, including the Washington Mutual consumer finance business and the announced tender offer for the shares of KorAm Bank, a leading bank in Korea," continued Prince. "As economies continue to strengthen around the world, we expect interest rates to increase. We have positioned the company to benefit as rates rise in the medium to long term.
        "Revenue growth of 16% was exceptionally strong in the first quarter, outpacing expense growth of 11% even as we made selective investments in our businesses to drive higher customer volumes. During the quarter, we implemented our risk capital allocation model, which will give us a more refined set of tools to make investment decisions across the businesses and geographies in which we operate. Also, underscoring the importance of giving consumers and small businesses the right skills to make financial decisions, we announced a $200 million investment over the next ten years in an initiative to improve financial education globally," said Prince.

Segment net revenues disclosed above are prepared on an owned basis in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The managed basis disclosures treat the receivables as if they had not been securitized and are still on our balance sheet, reflecting the interest revenue and expense associated with the portfolio, as well as the credit costs incurred. Although a managed basis presentation is not in conformity with GAAP, the Company believes it provides a representation of performance and key indicators of the credit card business that is consistent with the way the business is managed. For a reconciliation of managed basis revenue to GAAP revenues, see the Cards business on page 6.

The abbreviated income statement presented above is prepared on a managed basis (a non-GAAP measure), and includes the effect of securitizations in Adjusted Revenues, Net of Interest Expense and Adjusted Provision for Credit Losses. This income statement reconciles to Net Income which is a GAAP measure. Securitization changes Citigroup's role from that of a lender to that of a loan servicer and removes the receivables from Citigroup's balance sheet. For securitized receivables, amounts that would otherwise be reported as net interest revenue, fee and commission revenue, and credit losses are instead components of the servicing fees earned. However, Citigroup's exposure to credit losses on the securitized receivables is contractually limited to the cash flows from the receivables. The managed basis disclosures treat the receivables as if they had not been securitized and are still on the Company's balance sheet, with related income statement amounts reported as net interest revenue, fee and commission revenue, and credit losses. Although a managed basis presentation is not in conformity with GAAP, the Company believes it provides a representation of performance and key indicators of the credit card business that is consistent with the way management reviews operating performance and allocates resources. Furthermore, investors utilize information about the credit quality of the entire managed portfolio as the results of both the held and securitized portfolios impact the overall performance of the cards business.

Risk Capital is defined as the amount of capital needed to cover unexpected economic losses during extreme events. Return on Risk Capital is defined as income divided by Risk Capital. Return on Invested Capital is a similar calculation but includes adjustments for goodwill and intangibles in both the numerator and denominator, similar to those necessary to translate return on tangible equity to return on total equity. Return on Risk Capital and Return on Invested Capital are non-GAAP performance measures. Management believes Return on Risk Capital is useful to make incremental investment decisions and serves as a key metric for organic growth initiatives. Return on Invested Capital is used for multi-year investment decisions and as a long term performance measure.
