EXHIBIT 99.1 [CITIGROUP LOGO] FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CITIGROUP INC. (NYSE SYMBOL: C) AUGUST 9, 2004 CITIGROUP ANNOUNCES EXCHANGE OFFER FOR ITS 7.25% SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE 2010 NEW YORK, NY -- Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) today announced it had commenced an offer to exchange a new series of Subordinated Notes due 2014 (the "New Notes") for any and all of its 7.25% Subordinated Notes due 2010 (the "Old Notes"). The exchange offer will expire at midnight, New York City time, on September 13, 2004, unless extended or terminated. Citigroup will settle the exchange offer on the third business day following the expiration date or as soon as practicable thereafter (the "Settlement Date"). In the exchange offer, Citigroup is offering to exchange, for each $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes tendered on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 27, 2004 (subject to extension), a principal amount of New Notes equal to the "total exchange price," as adjusted by the "new issue price," for the Old Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn. For each $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes tendered after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 27, 2004 (subject to extension), but on or prior to the expiration of the exchange offer, Citigroup is offering to pay the total exchange price less $20, as adjusted by the new issue price. The total exchange price for the Old Notes will be calculated at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, two business days prior to the expiration of the exchange offer, and will equal (rounded to the nearest cent) the discounted value, excluding accrued interest, of the remaining payments of principal and interest on $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes through their maturity date at a discount rate equal to the bid-side yield on the 5.75% U.S. Treasury Note due August 15, 2010 based on the bid-side price of such Treasury Note at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on that date, plus 40 basis points. The total exchange price will be adjusted by the new issue price by dividing the total exchange price by the new issue price. The new issue price will equal the discounted value of the payments of principal and interest on $1 principal amount of New Notes through their maturity date at a discount rate equal to the bid-side yield on the then prevailing on-the-run 10 year benchmark which is anticipated to be issued on or about August 15, 2004 based on the bid side price of such Treasury Note at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, two business days prior to the
expiration of the exchange offer, plus 90 basis points. The new issue price will be rounded to the nearest cent per $1,000 principal amount of New Notes. The New Notes will bear interest at an annual rate determined two business days prior to the expiration of the exchange offer, such that the new issue price will be at or below, but as close as possible to, par. Tenders of Old Notes may be withdrawn at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 27, 2004, subject to extension. Consummation of the exchange offer is subject to a number of conditions including the absence of certain adverse legal and market developments. The offering is only made, and copies of the offering documents will only be made available to, holders of Old Notes that have certified certain matters to Citigroup, including their status as "qualified institutional buyers" or non "U.S. persons" located in France, Germany or the United States, as such terms are defined in accordance with Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Copies of the certification and the offering documents can be obtained from the information agent, Global Bondholder Services Corporation, at 866-485-1500 or 212-430-3774.
