Citigroup assumed the LTWs in connection with its acquisition of GSB in 2002. As disclosed by Citigroup on April 5, 2005, each LTW is exercisable for 0.02302 share of Citigroup common stock and $0.6727 in cash, or $0.6725 in cash per LTW after deduction of the Exercise Price of $0.0002 per LTW. Exercise of the LTWs shall be effected by sending the LTW certificates, accompanied by a properly completed and executed letter of transmittal and other required documents, to Citibank, N.A., the Warrant Agent, prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 3, 2005, at one of the addresses set forth on the letter of transmittal. Guaranteed delivery procedures are available, but only if the LTWs are surrendered by book-entry transfer through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company. Additional details about the LTWs can be found in the prospectus supplement with respect to shares of Citigroup common stock issuable upon exercise of the LTWs that Citigroup filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and mailed to LTW holders on April 5, 2005.
