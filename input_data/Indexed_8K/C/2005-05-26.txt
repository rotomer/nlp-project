                (i)            Net income excluding the research settlements, litigation charges and gain on Samba.
 
                The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a fuller understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of those results in prior periods as well as demonstrating the effects of unusual charges in the quarter.
