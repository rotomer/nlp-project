It is understood that the Company may from time to time authorize the issuance and sale of additional amounts of the Notes and that such Notes may be issued and sold pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, all as though the issuance and sale of such Notes were authorized by the Company as of the date hereof. The Notes may be denominated in U.S. dollars, foreign currencies or composite currencies (the "Specified Currency") as may be specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement (as defined herein) relating to any particular issue of Notes. The Notes, Series A, will be issued under an indenture (the "Senior Debt Indenture"), dated as of June 1, 2005, among the Company, the Guarantor, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as trustee. The Notes, Series B, will be issued under an indenture (the "Subordinated Debt Indenture," and, together with the Senior Debt Indenture, the "Indentures"), dated as of June 1, 2005, among the Company, the Guarantor, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (together with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the "Trustees"). Unless otherwise specifically provided for and set forth in a supplement to the Prospectus referred to below, the Medium-Term Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of

The Medium-Term Notes will be issued, and the terms thereof established, in accordance with the Indentures and the Medium-Term Notes Administrative Procedures attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "U.S. Procedures") (unless a Terms Agreement (as defined in Section 2(b)) modifies or otherwise supersedes such U.S. Procedures with respect to the Medium-Term Notes issued pursuant to such Terms Agreement). The U.S. Procedures may only be amended by written agreement of the Company, the Guarantor and the U.S. Agent after notice to, and with the approval of, the Trustees.

Any reference herein to the Prospectus, a Preliminary Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the applicable form under the Act, as of the date of such Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus Supplement, as the case may be; any reference to any amendment or supplement to any Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus Supplement, including any supplement to the Prospectus that sets forth only the terms of a particular issue of the Notes (a "Pricing Supplement"), shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such Prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus Supplement, as the case may be, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and incorporated by reference in such Prospectus or Prospectus Supplement, as the case may be; any reference to any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to include any report of the Guarantor filed pursuant to the Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; and any reference to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented shall be deemed to refer to and include the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the Notes sold pursuant to this Agreement, in the form in which it is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, including any documents incorporated by reference therein as of the date of such filing); (b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder, and any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, or any further amendment or supplement thereto, when such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; 3
(c) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, and the Indentures, conform or will conform in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; (d) The Registration Statement as of its effective date did not and, as amended as of any time, did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading and the Prospectus, as amended and supplemented as of any such time, did not and will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Guarantor makes any representations or warranties as to the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon, and in conformity with, information furnished in writing to the Company or the Guarantor by or on behalf of any Agent specifically for use in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto; (e) The Notes have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the Indentures and delivered to and duly paid for by the purchasers thereof, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indentures (subject, as to enforcement, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); the Indentures have been duly authorized by the Company and qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; and the Indentures conform to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented to relate to such issuance of Notes; (f) The Guarantees have been duly authorized and, when the Notes have been executed, authenticated and delivered by the Guarantor in accordance with the Indentures, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indentures; and (g) Since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, there has not been any material adverse change in the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which is not disclosed in the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented. 2. Appointment of Agents. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and subject to the reservation by the Company of the right to sell Notes to any of you acting as principal at a discount for its own account or for resale to one or more investors or other dealers and the Company's right to sell Notes directly to investors on its own behalf or through other agents, the Company hereby appoints and authorizes the U.S. Agent and the International Agent to act as its agents to solicit offers for the purchase of all or part of the Medium-Term Notes and Euro Medium-Term Notes, respectively, from the Company; provided, however, that only the International Agent may solicit offers for the purchase of Euro Medium-Term Notes. 4
Following the Commencement Date (referred to below), the Company shall notify each Agent from time to time as to the commencement of a period during which the Notes may be offered and sold by the Agents (each period, commencing with such a notification and ending at such time as the authorization for offers and sales through the Agents shall have been suspended by the Company or the Agents as provided hereunder, being herein referred to as an "Offering Period"). The initial Offering Period shall begin on June 1, 2005 (the "Commencement Date"). On the basis of the representations and warranties, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each of the U.S. Agent and the International Agent agrees, as agent of the Company, to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit offers to purchase Medium-Term Notes and Euro Medium-Term Notes, respectively, from the Company upon the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Prospectus (and any supplement thereto) and in the U.S. or Euro Procedures, as applicable. Each Agent shall communicate to the Company, orally or in writing, each reasonable offer or indication of interest to purchase Notes received by such Agent as Agent. The Company shall have the sole right to accept offers to purchase the Notes and may reject any such offer in whole or in part. Each Agent shall have the right to reject, in its discretion reasonably exercised, any offer received by it to purchase the Notes, in whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of its agreements contained herein. In soliciting offers to purchase the Notes in its capacity as agent of the Company, each Agent is acting solely as agent for the Company, and not as principal, and does not assume any obligation toward or relationship of agency or trust with any purchaser of the Notes (other than any such obligation or relationship which the Agent assumes independently of this Agreement). Each Agent shall make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Company, but such Agent shall not, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, be obligated to disclose the identity of any purchaser or have any liability to the Company in the event any such purchase is not consummated for any reason. Except as provided in Section 2(b), under no circumstances will any Agent be obligated to purchase any Notes for its own account. It is understood and agreed, however, that any of you may purchase Notes as principal pursuant to Section 2(b). The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to instruct the U.S. Agent and the International Agent to suspend at any time, for any period of time or permanently, the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes. Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the U.S. Agent and the International Agent (or either or both of them, as the case may be) will forthwith suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Notes from the Company until such time as the Company has advised them that such solicitation may be resumed. The Company agrees to pay each Agent a commission, on the Settlement Date with respect to each sale of Notes by the Company as a result of a solicitation made by such Agent, in an amount equal to that percentage specified in Schedule I hereto of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes sold by the Company. Such commission shall be payable as specified in the U.S. or Euro Procedures, as applicable. Without the prior approval of the Company, no Agent (acting on an agency basis) may reallow any portion of the commission payable pursuant hereto to dealers or purchasers in connection with the offer and sale of any Notes. 5
Subject to the provisions of this Section and to the U.S. or Euro Procedures, as applicable, offers for the purchase of Notes may be solicited by an Agent as agent for the Company at such time and in such amounts as such Agent shall deem advisable. The Company may from time to time offer Notes for sale otherwise than through an Agent; provided, however, that so long as this Agreement is in effect the Company shall not solicit or accept offers to purchase Notes through any agent other than an Agent. If the Company defaults in its obligations to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company and the Guarantor shall indemnify and hold each of you harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company. (b) Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, whenever the Company and any of you determine that the Company shall sell Notes directly to any of you as principal, each such sale of Notes shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and a supplemental agreement relating to such sale. Each such supplemental agreement (which may be either an oral or written agreement) is herein referred to as a "Terms Agreement". Each Terms Agreement shall describe the Notes to be purchased by the Purchaser pursuant thereto and shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, the price to be paid to the Company for such Notes, the maturity date of such Notes, the rate at which interest will be paid on such Notes, the dates on which interest will be paid on such Notes and the record date with respect to each such payment of interest, such other terms of the Notes as are applicable, the Settlement Date for the purchase of such Notes, the place of delivery of the Notes and payment therefor, the method of payment and any requirements for the delivery of opinions of counsel, certificates from the Company, the Guarantor or their respective officers or a letter from the Guarantor's independent registered public accountants as described in Section 5(b). A Terms Agreement may also specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of such Notes by the Agent. Any written Terms Agreement may be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C. The Purchaser's commitment to purchase Notes shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Each date of delivery of and payment for Notes to be purchased by any of you as principal or as agent or by any other purchaser is referred to herein as a "Settlement Date". Delivery of the certificates for Notes sold to the Purchaser pursuant to a Terms Agreement shall be made not later than the Settlement Date agreed to in such Terms Agreement, against payment of funds to the Company in the net amount due to the Company for such Notes by the method and in the form set forth in the U.S. or Euro Procedures, as applicable, unless otherwise agreed to between the Company and the Purchaser in such Terms Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to between the Company and the Purchaser in a Terms Agreement, any Note sold to a Purchaser (i) shall be purchased by such Purchaser at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof less a percentage equal to the commission applicable to an agency sale of a Note of identical maturity and (ii) may be resold by such Purchaser at varying prices from time to time or, if set forth in the applicable Terms Agreement and Pricing Supplement, at a fixed public offering price. In connection with any resale of Notes 6
purchased, a Purchaser may use a selling or dealer group and may reallow to any broker or dealer any portion of the discount or commission payable pursuant hereto. (c) Additional Agents. Notwithstanding paragraph 2(a) above, the Company may from time to time appoint one or more additional financial institutions experienced in the distribution of securities as a U.S. Agent or International Agent under this Agreement, for the duration of this Agreement (subject to Section 7 hereof) or on an issue by issue basis, pursuant to a letter (an "Agent Accession Confirmation") substantially in the form of Exhibit D or Exhibit F to this Agreement, as appropriate, provided that any such additional party shall have first requested appointment as such upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement in writing to the Company pursuant to a letter (an "Agent Accession Letter") substantially in the form of Exhibit E or Exhibit G to this Agreement, as appropriate, whereupon it shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the relevant Agent Accession Letter and the relevant Agent Accession Confirmation, become a party to this Agreement as a U.S. Agent, or an International Agent, as specified in the relevant Agent Accession Letter, vested with all the authority, rights and powers and subject to all the duties and obligations of an Agent as if originally named as an Agent hereunder. The Company shall promptly notify the Guarantor, the Trustees and the other Agents of any such appointment, but only in the event that any such additional Agent is appointed for the duration of this Agreement. 3. Offering and Sale of Notes. The U.S. Agent, the International Agent and the Company agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by them in the U.S. or Euro Procedures, as the case may be. In connection with any offering of Euro Medium-Term Notes, the International Agent may act as stabilizing agent (the "Stabilizing Agent"), and as Stabilizing Agent may over-allot or effect transactions which stabilize or maintain the market price of the Euro Medium-Term Notes at a level which might not otherwise prevail. Such stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. The Stabilizing Agent, whose identity shall be disclosed in the applicable supplement to the Prospectus relating to such offering of Euro Medium-Term Notes, shall comply with all applicable laws. 4. Agreements. (A) The Company and the Guarantor agree with each of you that: (a) At any time during an Offering Period or during the time a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Act, prior to amending or supplementing either Registration Statement or the Prospectus, the Company and the Guarantor will furnish each Agent and such Agent's counsel with a copy of each proposed amendment or supplement (other than an amendment or supplement to be made pursuant to incorporation by reference of a document filed under the Exchange Act, or a Pricing Supplement or an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes). The Company and the Guarantor will promptly cause the Prospectus together with each amendment thereof or supplement thereto to be mailed or otherwise transmitted to the Commission for filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) by an appropriate method or will promptly cause the Prospectus together with each amendment thereof or supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to said Rule. If the Prospectus is amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement or 7
an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes), each Agent shall be furnished with such information relating to such filing as it may reasonably request, and no Agent shall be obligated to solicit offers to purchase Notes so long as it is not reasonably satisfied that such amendment or supplement complies in all material respects with the provisions of the Act and the Exchange Act. At any time during an Offering Period or during the time a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Act, the Company and the Guarantor will promptly advise each Agent of (i) the filing of any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus (other than a Pricing Supplement or an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes), (ii) the filing or effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (iii) the receipt by the Company or the Guarantor of comments from the Commission relating to or requests by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or any amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose, and (v) the receipt by the Company or the Guarantor of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company and the Guarantor will use their reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or notice of suspension of qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. Upon any Agent's request, the Company and the Guarantor will within a reasonable time inform such Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Notes registered under the Registration Statement that remain unissued. (b) Within the time during which a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Act, the Company and the Guarantor will comply with all requirements imposed upon them by the Act, as now and hereafter amended, and by the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, as from time to time in force, so far as necessary to permit the continuance of sales of or dealings in the Notes as contemplated by the provisions hereof and the Prospectus. If during such period any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then existing, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of the Company and the Guarantor, during such period it is necessary to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus to comply with the Act, the Company promptly will notify each Agent to suspend the solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes in its capacity as Agent and to cease sales of any Notes it may then own as principal and, to the extent required under the provision in the last sentence of this subsection (b), the Company and the Guarantor promptly will amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (at the expense of the Company and the Guarantor) so as to correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance. If such amendment or supplement, and any documents, certificates, opinions and letters furnished to each Agent pursuant to subsections (i), (j) and (k) of this Section 4(A) in connection with the preparation and filing of such amendment or supplement, are reasonably satisfactory in all respects to such Agent, upon the filing of such amendment or supplement with the Commission or effectiveness of an amendment to the Registration Statement, such Agent will resume solicitation of offers to purchase Notes hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be required to comply with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section 4(A) during any period from the time any Agent shall have been notified to suspend the solicitation of 8
offers to purchase the Notes in its capacity as Agent (whether under this subsection (b) or otherwise under this Agreement) to the time the Company shall determine that solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes should be resumed; provided that if any such Agent holds any Notes as principal purchased pursuant to a Terms Agreement or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantor shall comply with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section 4(A) during the period when a Prospectus is required to be delivered pursuant to the Act. (c) The Guarantor will comply, in a timely manner, with all applicable requirements under the Exchange Act relating to the filing with the Commission of the Guarantor's reports pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and, if then applicable, of the Guarantor's proxy statements pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act. (d) The Company and the Guarantor will use their best efforts to qualify the Notes for sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as any Agent reasonably designates, to maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Notes and, if requested by such Agent, to arrange for the determination of the legality of the Notes for purchase by institutional investors, except that neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be required in connection therewith to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. (e) The Company and the Guarantor will furnish to each Agent copies of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus (including all documents incorporated by reference therein), and all amendments of and supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which are filed with the Commission during the period in which a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Act (including all documents filed by an amendment or supplement with the Commission during such period which are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein), in each case in such quantities as such Agent may from time to time reasonably request. (f) So long as any of the Notes are outstanding, the Guarantor agrees to furnish to each Agent, upon its reasonable request, as soon as available, all reports and financial statements filed by or on behalf of the Guarantor with the Commission or any national securities exchange. The Guarantor shall be deemed to have furnished such information to such Agent if (i) such reports and financial statements are generally available on, and can be printed and/or downloaded from, the Securities and Exchange Commission's internet website, www.sec.gov (or any other website of which the Guarantor notifies such Agent), and (ii) such Agent has been notified by the Guarantor that such reports and financial statements have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (g) The Company and the Guarantor shall, whether or not any sale of Notes is consummated or this Agreement is terminated, pay all expenses incident to the performance of their obligations under this Agreement and under any Terms Agreement, including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of its accountants and counsel, the cost of printing (or other production) and delivery of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, all amendments thereof and supplements thereto, the Indentures, and all other documents relating to the offering, the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Notes, the fees and disbursements 9
(including reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in connection with the qualification of the Notes for sale and determination of eligibility for investment of the Notes under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Agent may designate, the fees and disbursements of the Trustees, the fees of any agency that rates the Notes, the fees and expenses in connection with any listing of the Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or such other securities exchange agreed to in writing by the Company, the fees and expenses incurred with respect to any filing with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and the reasonable fees and disbursements of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, as counsel for the Agents, or other counsel reasonably satisfactory to each of the Agents, the Company and the Guarantor, and such other expenses, including, without limitation, advertising expenses as may be agreed upon by the Agents, the Company and the Guarantor; provided, however, that with respect to any purchase of Notes by one of you as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the fees and disbursements of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP or other counsel to you shall not be paid by either the Company or the Guarantor. (h) During the term of this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantor shall furnish to each Agent such relevant documents and certificates of officers of the Company and the Guarantor relating to the business, operations and affairs of the Company and the Guarantor, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the Indentures, the Notes, this Agreement, the Procedures, any Terms Agreement and the performance by the Company and the Guarantor of their obligations hereunder or thereunder as any Agent may from time to time reasonably request, and the Company and the Guarantor shall promptly notify each Agent orally, followed by written notice, of any downgrading or of the receipt by either of them of any notice of any intended downgrading in the rating accorded any securities of either the Company or the Guarantor by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or, if one of them no longer rates the securities of either the Company or the Guarantor, another "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) (2) under the Act. (i) Each time the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement, an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes, or an amendment or supplement made pursuant to the incorporation by reference of a document filed under the Exchange Act), if requested by any Agent, the Company and the Guarantor will deliver or cause to be delivered forthwith to such Agent a certificate of the Company and the Guarantor, signed by (A) on behalf of the Company, the Chairman, the President or any Vice President and by the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer, the Controller, the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary and, (B) on behalf of the Guarantor, the Chairman, any Vice Chairman, any Vice President, the principal financial officer, the General Counsel, the Controller, any Deputy Controller or the principal accounting officer and by the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer, the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary (or another officer or officers acceptable to the Purchasing Agent), dated the date of the effectiveness of such amendment or the date of filing with the Commission of such supplement or document, as the case may be, in form reasonably satisfactory to such Agent, to the effect that the statements contained in the certificate referred to in Section 5(b) (iii) that was last furnished to such Agent (either pursuant to Section 5(b) (iii) or pursuant to this Section 4(A)(i)) are true and correct at the time of the effectiveness of such amendment or the time of filing of such supplement or document, as the case may be, as though made at and as of such time (except that 10
such statements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement, as amended at the time of effectiveness of such amendment, and to the Prospectus, as amended and supplemented at the date of such certificate) or, in lieu of such certificate, a certificate of the same tenor as the certificate referred to in Section 5(b) (iii) but modified, if necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement, as amended at the time of the effectiveness of such amendment, and to the Prospectus, as amended and supplemented at the date of such certificate. (j) Each time the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement, an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes, or an amendment or supplement made pursuant to the incorporation by reference of a document filed under the Exchange Act), if requested by either Agent, the Company and the Guarantor shall furnish to or cause to be furnished forthwith to such Agent the written opinion of the General Counsel -- Capital Markets of the Guarantor, or other counsel for the Company and/or the Guarantor reasonably satisfactory to such Agent, dated the date of the effectiveness of such amendment or the date of filing with the Commission of such supplement or document, as the case may be, in form reasonably satisfactory to such Agent, to the effect set forth in Exhibit C hereto. In lieu of such opinion, counsel last furnishing such an opinion to such Agent may furnish to such Agent a letter to the effect that such Agent may rely on such last opinion to the same extent as though it were dated the date of such letter and authorizing reliance on such last opinion (except that statements in such last opinion will be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement, as amended at the time of the effectiveness of such amendment, and to the Prospectus, as amended and supplemented at the date of such letter). (k) Each time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is amended or supplemented to set forth amended or supplemental financial information (other than by a Pricing Supplement, an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes, or an amendment or supplement made pursuant to the incorporation by reference of a document filed under the Exchange Act), if requested by either Agent, the Guarantor shall cause KPMG LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, forthwith to furnish such Agent a letter, dated the date of the effectiveness of such amendment or the date of filing of such supplement or document, as the case may be, in form satisfactory to such Agent, of the same tenor as the letter referred to in Section 5(b)(iv) hereof but modified to relate to the Registration Statement and Prospectus, as amended and supplemented to the date of such letter, with such changes as may be necessary to reflect changes in the financial statements and other information derived from the accounting records of the Guarantor; provided, however, that if the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is amended or supplemented solely to include or incorporate by reference financial information with respect to a fiscal quarter, KPMG LLP may limit the scope of such letter to the unaudited financial statements included in such amendment or supplement. (l) Each acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes and each sale of Notes to any of you as principal shall be deemed to be an affirmation that the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects at the time of such acceptance or sale, as the case may be, as though made at and as of such time, and an undertaking that such representations and warranties will be true and correct in all material respects at the time of delivery to the purchaser or his agent, or an Agent, or any of you acting as principal, of the Notes 11
relating to such acceptance, as the case may be, as though made at and as of such time (and it is understood that such representations and warranties shall relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to each such time). (m) Anything to the contrary in this Section 4 notwithstanding, if, at the time of any required notice, amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, the Company shall have instructed the Agents to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes in each Agent's capacity as Agent of the Company and any Agent does not then hold any Notes acquired by it as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement, neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be obligated to furnish or cause to be furnished any notice, certificate, opinion or letter otherwise required until such time as it shall determine that solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes should be resumed; and provided, further, that, prior to resuming such solicitation the Agents shall be entitled to receive any such notices, certificates, opinions or letters not previously furnished, accurate as of the date of such notice, certificate, opinion or letter. (n) The Company, the Guarantor and their respective affiliates will comply with the provisions of U.S. Treasury Regulations 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(1) and (2). (o) If any issue of Euro Medium-Term Notes is to be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Company and the Guarantor will use their best efforts to obtain the listing of such issue of Euro Medium-Term Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, to furnish to such Exchange all documents, information and undertakings that may be reasonably necessary in order to effect such listing, and to cause such listing to be continued so long as any of the Euro Medium-Term Notes of such issue remain outstanding. (p) The Company, the Guarantor or their respective designated agent(s) shall submit such reports or information as may be required from time to time by applicable law, regulations and guidelines promulgated by Japanese governmental and regulatory authorities in respect of the issue and purchase of Notes denominated in Japanese yen. (B) Each Agent represents to and agrees with the Company and the Guarantor that: (a) Except to the extent permitted under U.S. Treas. Reg. Section 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D) (the "D Rules"), (i) it has not offered or sold, and during the restricted period will not offer or sell, Euro Medium-Term Notes to a person who is within the United States or its possessions or to a United States person, and (ii) it has not delivered and will not deliver within the United States or its possessions definitive Euro Medium-Term Notes that are sold during the restricted period. (b) It has and throughout the restricted period will have in effect procedures reasonably designed to ensure that its employees or agents who are directly engaged in selling Euro Medium-Term Notes are aware that such Euro Medium-Term Notes may not be offered or sold during the restricted period to a person who is within the United States or its possessions or to a United States person, except as permitted by the D Rules. 12
(c) If it is a United States person, it represents that it is acquiring the Euro Medium-Term Notes for purposes of resale in connection with their original issuance, and if it retains Euro Medium-Term Notes for its own account, it will only do so in accordance with the requirements of U.S. Treas. Reg. Section 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(6). (d) With respect to each of its affiliates that acquires Euro Medium-Term Notes from it for the purpose of offering or selling such Euro Medium-Term Notes during the restricted period, it repeats and confirms the representations and agreements contained in Sections 4(B)(a), (b) and (c) on such affiliate's behalf. (e) It has not entered and will not enter into any contractual arrangement with respect to the distribution or delivery of Euro Medium-Term Notes, except with their affiliates or with the prior written consent of the Company and the Guarantor. Terms used in this Section 4(B) have the meanings given to them by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder, including the D Rules. For these purposes, the "restricted period" with respect to a Euro Medium-Term Note generally ends upon the expiration of the 40-day period beginning on the issue date of such Euro Medium-Term Note, unless the International Agent holds such Euro Medium-Term Note as part of an unsold allotment or subscription, in which case the "restricted period" continues for so long as the International Agent holds such Euro Medium-Term Note. (f) It has not offered or sold and, prior to the expiration of the period of six months from the date of issue of any Notes having a maturity of one year or greater, will not offer or sell any Notes to persons in the United Kingdom, except to those persons whose ordinary activities involve them in acquiring, holding, managing or disposing of investments, as principal or agent, for the purposes of their businesses or otherwise in circumstances which have not resulted and will not result in an offer to the public in the United Kingdom for purposes of the Public Offers of Securities Regulations 1995. (g) It has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA") with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. (h) It has only communicated or caused to be communicated and it will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of FSMA does not apply to either the Company or the Guarantor. (i) It will not offer or sell any Notes directly or indirectly in Japan or to, or for the benefit of, any Japanese person or to others, for re-offering or re-sale directly or indirectly in Japan or to any Japanese person except under circumstances which will result in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and guidelines promulgated by the relevant governmental and regulatory authorities in effect at the relevant time. For purposes of this paragraph, "Japanese person" means any person resident in Japan, including any corporation or other entity organized under the laws of Japan. 13

(iii) There shall not have been any downgrading, nor any notice given of any intended downgrading, in the rating accorded any securities of either the Company or the Guarantor by Moody's Investor Service or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or, if one of them no longer rates the securities of either the Company or the Guarantor, another "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) (2) under the Act, except, in the case of any purchase of Notes by any Agent as principal, as disclosed to the Agent in writing by the Company and the Guarantor before the Company accepted the offer to purchase such Notes. (b) On the Commencement Date and, if called for by any agreement by any Agent to purchase Notes as principal, on the corresponding Settlement Date: (i) The Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to each Agent the opinion of the General Counsel -- Capital Markets of the Guarantor (or other counsel for the Company and/or the Guarantor reasonably acceptable to the Agent) on the Commencement Date, and, on the Settlement Date will furnish the opinion of the General Counsel -- Capital Markets of the Guarantor (or other counsel for the Company and/or the Guarantor reasonably acceptable to such Agent) and, if called for by a Terms Agreement, the opinion of other counsel, dated the Commencement Date or the Settlement Date, as the case may be, to the effect set forth in Exhibit H hereto.

Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company and the Guarantor will indemnify and hold harmless each of you against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which each of you may become subject under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement when it became effective, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and will reimburse each of you for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by you in connection with investigating or defending against such loss, claim damage, liability or action; provided, however, that (i) neither the Company nor the 16
Guarantor shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by or on behalf of any of you specifically for use in the preparation thereof, and (ii) such indemnity with respect to any Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any preliminary supplemental prospectus, shall not inure to the benefit of any of you (or any person controlling you) if the Company and the Guarantor shall have delivered sufficient quantities of the Prospectus, as amended and supplemented, to you within a reasonable time prior to the earlier of the delivery of the written confirmation of the sale of such Notes or the delivery of such Notes to the person asserting such loss, claim, damage, liability or action for which indemnification is sought, and the Prospectus as so amended and supplemented (excluding documents incorporated by reference) was not sent or given to such person by you at or prior to the earlier of the delivery of the written confirmation of the sale of such Notes or the delivery of such Notes to such person in any case where such sending or giving of a prospectus is required by the Act, and the untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in such Preliminary Prospectus, such Prospectus or such preliminary supplemental prospectus, was corrected in the Prospectus, as so amended and supplemented, provided to you. (b) Each Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which either the Company or the Guarantor may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any part of the Registration Statement when it became effective, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by or on behalf of any Agent specifically for use in the preparation thereof, and will reimburse the Company and the Guarantor for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by either of them in connection with investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying party may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it shall wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnified party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall 17
not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and by each of you on the other from the offering of the Notes from which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arose, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and by each of you on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and by each of you on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes from which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arose (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions received by each of you in connection with such offering. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Guarantor or by any of you and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantor and each of you agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation (even if you were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim (which shall be limited as provided in subsection (c) above if the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of any such action in accordance with the provisions thereof) which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), none of you shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes sold by the Company from which such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arose pursuant to offers solicited by you were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which you have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Agents' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute shall be several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this subsection (d) of the notice of the commencement of any action against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against an indemnifying party under this subsection (d), such indemnified party shall notify the 18
indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof if the notice specified in subsection (c) above has not been given with respect to such action; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this subsection (d). (e) The obligations of the Company and the Guarantor under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Guarantor may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any of you within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of each of you under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which you may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company and the Guarantor (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of either the Company or the Guarantor), to each officer of the Company and the Guarantor who has signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of the Act or the Exchange Act. 7. Termination. (a) This Agreement will continue in effect until terminated as provided in this Section 7. This Agreement may be terminated by either the Company and the Guarantor as to any Agent, or by any Agent, insofar as this Agreement relates to such Agent, by giving written notice of such termination to such Agent or the Company and the Guarantor, as the case may be. The termination of this Agreement shall not require termination of any agreement by any of you to purchase Notes as principal, and the termination of any such Agreement shall not require termination of this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated, neither the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, nor any Agent, on the other hand, shall have any liability to each other, except as provided in the first sentence of the fourth paragraph of Section 2(a), the last proviso of Section 4(A)(b), and Sections 4(A)(g), 4(A)(h), 6, 8 and 11, and except that, if at the time of termination an offer to purchase any of the Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or its agent of the Note or Notes relating thereto has not occurred, the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor stated in Section 2 and the Company's obligations under the U.S. Procedures and the Euro Procedures, and in Sections 2(c), 4(A)(a), 4(A)(b), 4(A)(c), 4(A)(e), 4(A)(i), 4(A)(j), 4(A)(k), 4(A)(1), 4(A)(m), 4(A)(o), 4(A)(q), 4(A)(r) and 5 shall also remain in full force and effect and not be terminated until the delivery of such Notes. 8. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. With respect to any Agent's solicitation of offers to purchase Notes as agent of the Company or any of your obligation to purchase Notes as principal pursuant to any Terms Agreement or otherwise, the respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company and the Guarantor or their officers and of any of you set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of you, the Company, the Guarantor or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 6 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Notes for a period extending to the earlier of (i) three years from the corresponding Settlement Date for such Notes or (ii) the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations governing such solicitation or purchase of Notes. 19
9. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to an Agent, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to such Agent, at the address specified in Schedule I hereto; or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to it at Citigroup Funding Inc., 388 Greenwich Street, 38th Floor, New York, New York 10013, Attention: Treasurer; and if sent to the Guarantor, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to it at Citigroup Inc., 425 Park Avenue, 2nd Floor, New York, New York 10043, Attention: General Counsel - -- Capital Markets. 10. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 6 hereof. Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement or any Terms Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and the controlling persons and officers and directors referred to in Section 6 and their heirs and legal representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any Terms Agreement or any provision herein or therein contained. This Agreement and any Terms Agreement and all conditions and provisions hereof and thereof except to the extent provided for in Section 5 hereof are intended to be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and said controlling persons and officers and directors and their heirs and legal representatives, and for the benefit of no other person, firm or corporation. No Purchaser of Notes shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such purchase. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of any of you hereunder may not be assigned without the prior written consent of the Company and the Guarantor. 11. Waivers, Etc. Neither any failure nor delay on the part of any party to exercise any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement (singly and collectively referred to as a "Right") shall operate as a waiver of such Right, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any Right preclude any other or further exercise of any Right, nor shall any waiver of any Right with respect to any occurrence be construed as a waiver of any Right with respect to any other occurrence. 12. Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. 20

Citigroup Global Markets Inc. has agreed, as agent, to solicit purchases of Notes issued in fully registered form.

The Notes have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission").

Each Global Security will be dated and issued as of the date of its settlement. Each Global Security will bear an Original Issue Date, which will be (i) with respect to an original Global Security (or any portion thereof), the Original Issue Date specified in such Global Security and (ii) following a consolidation of Global Securities, with respect to the Global Security resulting from such consolidation, the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for on the predecessor Global Securities, regardless of the date of authentication of such resulting Global Security. No Global Security will represent (i) both Fixed Rate and Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes, (ii) any Certificated Note, or (iii) both Series A Notes and Series B Notes. Identification Numbers: The Company has arranged with the CUSIP Service Bureau of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (the "CUSIP Service Bureau") for the reservation of two Series of CUSIP numbers, one for Series A Notes and one for Series B Notes, each of which series consists of approximately 900 CUSIP numbers and relates to Global Securities representing Book-Entry Notes and book-entry medium-term notes issued by the Company with other Series designations. The DTC Agents, the Company and DTC have obtained from the CUSIP Service Bureau a written list of such reserved CUSIP numbers. The DTC Agents will assign CUSIP numbers to Global Securities as described below under Settlement Procedure "B". DTC will notify the CUSIP Service Bureau periodically of the CUSIP numbers that the DTC Agents have assigned to Global Securities. Each DTC Agent will notify the Company at any time when fewer than 100 of the reserved CUSIP numbers remain unassigned to Global Securities, and, if it deems necessary, the Company will reserve additional CUSIP numbers for assignment to Global Securities. Upon obtaining such additional CUSIP numbers, the Company shall deliver a list of such additional CUSIP numbers to either or both DTC Agents, as needed, and to DTC. A-3
Registration: Global Securities will be issued only in fully registered form without coupons. Each Global Security will be registered in the name of CEDE & CO., as nominee for DTC, on the securities register for the Notes (the "Securities Register") maintained under the Indentures. The beneficial owner of a Book-Entry Note (or one or more indirect participants in DTC designated by such owner) will designate one or more participants in DTC (with respect to such Book-Entry Note, the "Participants") to act as agent or agents for such owner in connection with the book-entry system maintained by DTC, and DTC will record in book-entry form, in accordance with instructions provided by such Participants, a credit balance with respect to such beneficial owner in such Book-Entry Note in the account of such Participants. The ownership interest of such beneficial owner (or such participant) in such Book-Entry Note will be recorded through the records of such Participants or through the separate records of such Participants and one or more indirect participants in DTC. Transfers: Transfers of a Book-Entry Note will be accomplished by book entries made by DTC and, in turn, by Participants (and in certain cases, one or more indirect participants in DTC) acting on behalf of beneficial transferors and transferees of such Note. Exchanges: Each DTC Agent may deliver to DTC and the CUSIP Service Bureau at any time a written notice of consolidation (a copy of which shall be attached to the resulting Global Security described below) specifying (i) the CUSIP numbers of two or more outstanding Global Securities that represent (A) Fixed Rate Book-Entry Notes of the same Series and having the same Terms and for which interest has been paid to the same date or (B) Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes of the same Series and having the same Terms and for which interest has been paid to the same date, (ii) a date, occurring at least thirty days after such written notice is delivered and at least thirty days before the next Interest Payment Date for such Book-Entry Notes, on which such Global Securities shall be exchanged for a single replacement Global Security and (iii) a new CUSIP number to be assigned to such replacement Global Security. Upon receipt of such a notice, DTC will send to its participants (including the DTC Agent for such replacement Global Security) a written reorganization notice to the effect that such exchange will occur on such date. Prior to the specified exchange date, such DTC Agent will deliver to the CUSIP Service Bureau a written notice setting forth such exchange date and such new CUSIP number and stating that, as of such exchange date, the CUSIP numbers of the Global Securities to be exchanged will no longer be valid. On the specified exchange date, such DTC Agent will exchange such Global Securities for a single Global Security bearing the new CUSIP number and a new Original Issue Date, which shall be the last date to which interest has been paid on the underlying A-4
Book-Entry Notes, and the CUSIP numbers of the exchanged Global Securities will, in accordance with CUSIP Service Bureau procedures, be canceled and not immediately reassigned. Upon such exchange, the DTC Agent will mark the predecessor Global Security "canceled", make appropriate entries in the DTC Agent's records and destroy such canceled Global Security in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and deliver a certificate of destruction to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Global Securities to be exchanged exceed U.S $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount, one Global Security will be authenticated and issued to represent each U.S. $500,000,000 of principal amount of the exchanged Global Securities and an additional Global Security will be authenticated and issued to represent any remaining principal amount of such Global Securities (see "Denominations" below). Maturities: Each Book-Entry Note will mature on a date nine months or more after the issue date for such Note, except in the case of indexed Notes, for which the maturity may be shorter. A Floating Rate Book-Entry Note will mature only on an Interest Payment Date for such Note. Any Note denominated in Japanese yen will mature on a date not less than one year from the Original Issue Date (as defined below) for such Note. Any Note denominated in Pounds Sterling will mature on a date not less than one year, nor more than five years, after its Original Issue Date. Denominations: Book-Entry Notes will be issued in principal amounts of U.S.$1,000 or any amount in excess thereof that is an integral multiple of U.S.$1,000. If Book-Entry Notes are denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, the denominations of such Notes will be determined pursuant to the provisions of the applicable Pricing Supplement. Global Securities will be denominated in principal amounts not in excess of U.S.$500,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof). If one or more Book-Entry Notes having an aggregate principal amount in excess of U.S.$500,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof) would, but for the preceding sentence, be represented by a single Global Security, then one Global Security will be authenticated and issued to represent each U.S.$500,000,000 principal amount (or the equivalent thereof) of such Book-Entry Note or Notes and an additional Global Security will be authenticated and issued to represent any remaining principal amount of such Book-Entry Note or Notes. In such a case, each of the Global Securities representing such Book-Entry Note or Notes shall be assigned the same CUSIP number. A-5

The Company will advise the Agent and the Trustees in writing of those persons handling administrative responsibilities with whom the Agent and the Trustees are to communicate regarding orders to purchase Bearer Notes and the details of their delivery. If the Notes are to be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Company will advise the Principal Paying Agents and the Agent as to the entity it has appointed as listing agent (the "Listing Agent"), which will coordinate with the Principal Paying Agents and the Agent on a regular basis for the purpose of providing the Luxembourg Stock Exchange with such information regarding Bearer Notes issued and outstanding as such Exchange may require. Administrative procedures and specific terms of the offering are explained below. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Indentures, the Prospectus or the Notes shall be used as therein defined. To the extent the procedures set forth below conflict with the provisions of the Bearer Notes, the Indentures or the Agency Agreement, the relevant provisions of the Bearer Notes, the Indentures and the Agency Agreement shall control. Maturities: Each Bearer Note will mature on a date nine months or more after the settlement date for such Note, except in the case of indexed Notes, for which the maturity may be shorter. A Floating Rate Bearer Note will mature only on an Interest Payment Date for such Bearer Note. Any Note denominated in Japanese yen will mature on a date not less than one year from the Original Issue Date (as defined below) for such Note. Any Note denominated in Pounds Sterling will mature on a date not less than one year, nor more than five years, after its Original Issue Date. Currency: The Specified Currency for a Certificated Note shall be as set forth therein and in the applicable Pricing Supplement. Denominations: The denomination of any Bearer Note denominated in U.S. dollars will be a minimum of U.S.$10,000 or any larger amount that is an integral multiple of U.S.$1,000. The authorized denominations of Bearer Notes denominated in any other currency will be set forth in such Bearer Notes. Bearer Form: Bearer Notes will be issued only in bearer form. Date of Issuance: Each Bearer Note will be dated and issued as of its original issue date by the Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note. Each Bearer Note will bear an Original Issue Date, which will be (i) with respect to a temporary Global Security (or any portion thereof), the date of its original issue as specified in such Global Security and (ii) with respect to any Permanent Global Security or individual Bearer Note (or portion thereof) issued subsequently upon transfer or exchange of a Bearer Note or in lieu of a destroyed, lost or stolen Bearer Note, the Original Issue Date of the predecessor Bearer Note, regardless of the B-2
date of authentication of such subsequently issued Bearer Note. Temporary Global Until the 40th day following the date of Securities; Definitive issuance of a Bearer Note (the "Exchange Global Securities; and Date") and until Final Certification (as Individual Bearer Notes: defined below) with respect to such Bearer Note has occurred, such Bearer Note, together with all other Bearer Notes that have the same rank, Original Issue Date, currency of denomination, redemption and repayment provisions, Stated Maturity and either fixed interest rate (in the case of Fixed Rate Notes) or Base Rate, Initial Interest Rate, interest reset period, Interest Payment Dates, Minimum Interest Rate, Maximum Interest Rate, Spread or Spread Multiplier and Index Maturity (in the case of Floating Rate Notes) (all such Bearer Notes herein referred to collectively as a "Tranche"), will be represented by a single temporary Global Security in bearer form without interest coupons. The Company shall execute, and the Principal Paying Agent for the Bearer Notes represented by such temporary Global Security shall authenticate, such temporary Global Security upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as a Permanent Global Security. On or prior to the Closing Date (which should also be the Original Issue Date), with respect to such Bearer Notes, the Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Notes shall deposit the temporary Global Security with a common depositary (the "Depositary") for Clearstream International, ("Clearstream") and Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System ("Euroclear"), in the manner specified below under "Details for Settlement". The interest of each beneficial owner of such temporary Global Security will be credited to the appropriate account with Clearstream or Euroclear, as specified below under "Details for Settlement". On or after the Exchange Date and provided that Final Certification (as described below) has occurred, the interest of the beneficial owner of such Bearer Note in the temporary Global Security shall be canceled and such Bearer Note, together with all other Bearer Notes of the Tranche as to which Final Certification has occurred, shall thereafter be represented by a Permanent Global Security in bearer form without interest coupons held in London by the Depositary. The interest of the beneficial owner of such Bearer Note in such Permanent Global Security will be credited to the appropriate account with Clearstream or Euroclear. The beneficial owner of an interest in a Permanent Global Security may, at any time, upon 30 days' notice to the Principal Paying Agent for the Bearer Notes represented by such Permanent Global Security, given by such beneficial owner through either Clearstream or Euroclear, as the case may be, exchange its beneficial interest in such Permanent Global Security for one or more individual Bearer Notes (with coupons attached, if appropriate) equal in aggregate principal B-3
amount to such beneficial interest. To effect such exchange, the interest of the beneficial owner of such Bearer Note in such Permanent Global Security shall be canceled and one or more individual Bearer Notes shall be issued to such beneficial owner, through Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be. In all events, Bearer Notes will be delivered by the Principal Paying Agents only outside the United States. Final Certification: Final Certification with respect to a temporary Global Security shall mean the delivery by Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, to the Principal Paying Agent for the Bearer Notes represented by such temporary Global Security of a signed certificate (a "Clearance System Certificate") in the form set forth in Appendix 1 hereto with respect to the Bearer Notes, dated no earlier than the Exchange Date for such Bearer Notes or, if an interest payment on the Bearer Notes shall be due prior to the Exchange Date, dated no earlier than such Interest Payment Date, to the effect that Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, has received certificates ("Certificates of Non-U.S. Beneficial Ownership") in the form set forth in Appendix 2 hereto with respect to each of such Bearer Notes, dated no earlier than ten days before such Exchange Date or Interest Payment Date, as the case may be, signed by the account holders appearing on its records as entitled to such Bearer Notes, to the effect that such Bearer Notes (i) are not beneficially owned by United States persons and have not been acquired by or on behalf of United States persons, (ii) are owned by United States persons that are (a) foreign branches of United States financial institutions purchasing for their own account or for resale or (b) United States persons who acquired the Bearer Notes through foreign branches of U.S. financial institutions and who hold the Bearer Notes through such U.S. financial institutions (and in either case (a) or (b), each such financial institution has agreed that it will comply with the requirements of Section 165(j)(3)(A), (B) or (C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the regulations thereunder), or (iii) are owned by United States or foreign financial institutions for purposes of resale during the restricted period, in which event such financial institutions (whether or not also described in clause (i) or (ii)) shall have certified that they have not acquired the Bearer Notes for purposes of resale directly or indirectly to a United States person or to a person within the United States or its possessions. Payments of Principal: Upon presentation of a Note, the Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note will pay the principal amount of such Note and the final installment of interest at Maturity in immediately available funds. Notes presented to the Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Notes at Maturity for payment will be canceled in accordance with the B-4
Indenture under which such Bearer Notes have been issued. Interest Payments: Interest on each Bearer Note will accrue from the Original Issue Date of such Bearer Note and will be calculated and paid in the manner described in such Bearer Note and the Prospectus, each as defined in the Agency Agreement, as supplemented by the applicable Pricing Supplement; provided, however, that interest in respect of any portion of a temporary Global Security for which Final Certification has not been made shall not be paid until Final Certification is received in respect of that portion. Payments of Principal Upon receipt of Bearer Notes to be repaid as and Interest Upon set forth in such Notes, the Trustee or Exercise of Optional Principal Paying Agent for such Notes shall Repayment: give notice to the Company not less than 20 calendar days prior to each Optional Repayment Date of such Optional Repayment Date and of the principal amount of Bearer Notes to be repaid on such Optional Repayment Date.

The Company will have the sole right to accept any such order to purchase Bearer Notes and may reject any such order in whole or in part.

The Agent will cause a Pricing Supplement to be delivered to the purchaser of the Bearer Note. In each instance that a Pricing Supplement is prepared, the Agent will affix copies of the Pricing Supplement to Prospectuses prior to their use.

Suspension of The Company reserves the right, in its sole Solicitation; discretion, to instruct the Agent to suspend Amendment or at any time, for any period of time or Supplement: permanently, the solicitation of orders to purchase Bearer Notes. Upon receipt of such instructions, the Agent will forthwith suspend solicitation of orders to purchase Bearer Notes from the Company until such time as the Company has advised it that such solicitation may be resumed. In the event that at the time the Company suspends solicitation of purchases there shall be any orders outstanding for settlement, the Company will promptly advise the Agent and each of the Principal Paying Agents whether such orders may be settled and whether copies of the Prospectus as in effect at the time of the suspension, B-6
together with the appropriate Pricing Supplement, may be delivered in connection with the settlement of such orders. The Company will have the sole responsibility for such decision and for any arrangements that may be made in the event that the Company determines that such orders may not be settled or that copies of such Prospectus may not be so delivered. If the Company and the Guarantor decide to amend or supplement the Registration Statement (as defined in the Agency Agreement) or the Prospectus (except for an amendment or supplement relating to an offering of Securities other than the Notes or to an offering of Warrants or providing solely for the specification of or a change in the maturity dates, the interest rates, the issuance prices or other terms of any Notes), they promptly will advise the Agent and the Trustees and will furnish the Agent and the Trustees with the proposed amendment or supplement and with such certificates and opinions as are required, all in accordance with the terms of the Agency Agreement. The Company and the Guarantor will file with the Commission any supplement to the Prospectus relating to the Bearer Notes, provide the Agent with copies of any such supplement, and confirm to the Agent that such supplement has been filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b). Delivery of Prospectus: A copy of the Prospectus and a Pricing Supplement relating to a Bearer Note must accompany or precede any written offer of such Note, confirmation of the purchase of such Note and payment for such Note by its purchaser. If notice of a change in the terms of the Bearer Notes is received by the Agent between the time an order for a Bearer Note is placed and the time written confirmation thereof is sent by the Agent to a customer or his agent, such confirmation shall be accompanied by a Prospectus and Pricing Supplement setting forth the terms in effect when the order was placed. Subject to the second preceding paragraph, the Agent will deliver a Prospectus and Pricing Supplement as herein described with respect to each Bearer Note sold by it. The Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note will make such delivery if such Note is sold directly by the Company to a purchaser (other than the Agent).

14. Agent's account number at Clearstream or Euroclear. The Agent will advise the Company and the Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note of the foregoing information (unless provided by the purchaser directly to the Company) for each offer to purchase a Bearer Note solicited by the Agent and accepted by the Company in time for the Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note to prepare and authenticate the temporary Global Security and deliver it at least one day prior to settlement to the Depositary in London. The Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note will instruct Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, to credit such Bearer Note to the distribution account of such Principal Paying Agent with Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, for onward credit to the account of the Agent against payment. Concurrently therewith and in consideration thereof, the Agent for such Bearer Note will give instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, to credit the account of the Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note against delivery of such Bearer Note with an amount equal to the initial public offering price of such Bearer Note, less the applicable commission determined as provided in Section 2 of the Agency Agreement. The Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note will remit all such funds received to the designated account of the Company. The Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note will notify the Agent of both the Euroclear and Clearstream Reference Numbers for such Bearer Note and will notify the Listing Agent of the issuance of such Bearer Note. Before accepting any order to purchase a Bearer Note to be settled in less than three Business Days, the Company shall verify that the Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note will have adequate time to prepare and authenticate the temporary Global Security that will represent such Bearer Note. The Agent will provide appropriate documentation to the Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note, including the information necessary for the preparation and authentication of the temporary Global Security that will represent such Bearer Note. Prior to preparing such temporary Global Security for delivery (but in any case no later than 10:00 A.M. (London time) on the Business Day next preceding the Closing Date therefor), the Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note will confirm receipt of such instruction to the Agent by telephone. Bearer Note Deliveries Upon receipt of appropriate documentation and and Cash Payment: instructions with respect to the Bearer Notes constituting a Tranche, the Company will cause the Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Notes to prepare and authenticate a temporary Global Security representing such Tranche and to insert thereon (1) the rank, (2) the principal amount of such Tranche, (3) the Original Issue Date, (4) the Stated Maturity, (5) the interest rate (in the case of a Fixed-Rate Note) and redemption B-9
and repayment provisions (if any) or the Base Rate, Initial Interest Rate, Index Maturity, Spread or Spread Multiplier, Minimum Interest Rate and Maximum Interest Rate (in the case of a Floating Rate Note) and redemption and repayment provisions (if any) and (6) any other terms required to be inserted thereon. On the Closing Date, the Principal Paying Agent for the Bearer Notes represented by such Tranche will credit such Bearer Note to its distribution account with Clearstream or Euroclear and the Agent will make payment to such Principal Paying Agent against delivery of such Bearer Note, through Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, in immediately available funds, in an amount equal to the issuance price of such Bearer Note less the Agent's commission. The Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note will remit all such funds received to the designated account of the Company. Such payment shall be made by the Agent only upon prior receipt by the Agent of immediately available funds from or on behalf of the purchaser unless the Agent decides, at its option, to advance its own funds for such payment against subsequent receipt of funds from the purchaser. Failure to Settle: If on the relevant Issue Date the Agent does not pay the subscription price due from it in respect of any Note (the "Defaulted Note") and, as a result, the Defaulted Note remains in the distribution account of the Principal Paying Agent for such Note with Euroclear or Clearstream after such Issue Date (rather than being credited to the Agent's account against payment), such Principal Paying Agent will continue to hold the Defaulted Note to the order of the Company. If such Principal Paying Agent pays an amount (the "Advance") to the Company on the basis that a payment (the "Payment") has been, or will be, received from the relevant Agent and if the Payment has not been, or is not, received by such Principal Paying Agent on the date such Principal Paying Agent pays the Company, the Company shall upon being requested to do so repay to such Principal Paying Agent the Advance and shall pay interest (on a 360 days basis) sufficient to cover any overdraft costs incurred by such Principal Paying Agent, as certified by such Principal Paying Agent, until the earlier of repayment in full of the Advance and receipt in full by such Principal Paying Agent of the Payment. If the Agent, at its own option, has advanced its own funds for payment against subsequent receipt of funds from the purchaser, and if the purchaser shall fail to make payment for the Bearer Note on the Closing Date therefor, the Agent will promptly notify the Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note, the Depositary and the Company by telephone, promptly confirmed in writing (but no later than the next Business Day). In such event the Agent shall instruct Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, to transfer such Defaulted Note to B-10
the distribution account of the Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note who will continue to hold the Defaulted Note to the order of the Company. Upon (i) confirmation from such Principal Paying Agent in writing (which may be by telex or telecopy) that such Principal Paying Agent is holding the Defaulted Note for the account of the Company, and (ii) confirmation from the Agent in writing (which may be given by telex or telecopy) that the Agent has not received payment from the purchaser (the matters referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) are referred to hereinafter as the "Confirmations"), the Company will promptly pay to the Agent an amount in immediately available funds equal to the amount previously paid by the Agent in respect of such Bearer Note. Such payment will be made not later than the Business Day following the date of receipt of the Confirmations. The Principal Paying Agent for such Bearer Note and the Depositary will make such revisions to the temporary Global Security representing such Bearer Note as are necessary to reflect the cancellation of such portion of such Global Security. If a purchaser shall fail to make payment for such Bearer Note for any reason other than the failure of the Agent to provide the necessary information to the Company as described above for settlement or to provide a confirmation to the purchaser within a reasonable period of time as described above or otherwise to satisfy its obligation hereunder or in the Agency Agreement, and if the Agent shall have otherwise complied with its obligations hereunder and in the Agency Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Agent on an equitable basis for its loss of the use of funds during the period when they were credited to the account of the Company. Principal Paying Agents Nothing herein shall be deemed to require Not to Risk Funds: Principal Paying Agent expend its own funds in connection with any payment to the Company, or the Agent or the purchaser, it being understood by all parties that payments made by the Principal Paying Agents to the Company, or the Agent or a purchaser shall be made only to the extent that funds are provided to the Principal Paying Agents for such purpose. Authenticity of The Company will cause each Principal Paying Signatures: Agent to furnish the Agent from time to time with the specimen signatures of each of such Principal Paying Agent's officers, employees or agents who has been authorized by such Principal Paying Agent to authenticate Bearer Notes (including Global Securities representing Bearer Notes), but the Agent will have no obligation or liability to the Company or to either Principal Paying Agent in respect of the authenticity of the signature of any officer, employee or agent of the Company or either Principal Paying Agent on any Bearer Note. Payment of Expenses: The Agent shall forward to the Company, on a monthly basis, a statement of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent during B-11
that month that are reimbursable to it pursuant to the terms of the Agency Agreement. The Company will remit payment to the Agent currently on a monthly basis. Advertising Costs: The Company will determine with the Agent the amount of advertising that may be appropriate in soliciting orders to purchase the Bearer Notes. Advertising expenses will be paid by the Company. B-12
