FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (CITIGROUP LOGO) CITIGROUP INC. (NYSE SYMBOL: C) JUNE 24, 2005 CITIGROUP TO SELL ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS TO RECEIVE LEGG MASON BROKER-DEALER BUSINESS AND OTHER CONSIDERATION TRANSACTION VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $3.7 BILLION NEW YORK, June 24, 2005 - Citigroup today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement under which Citigroup will sell substantially all of its Asset Management business in exchange for the broker-dealer business of Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE: LM), approximately $1.5 billion of Legg Mason's common and convertible preferred shares, and approximately $550 million in the form of a five-year loan facility provided by Citigroup Corporate and Investment Banking. The transaction does not include Citigroup's asset management business in Mexico, its retirement services business in Latin America or its interest in the CitiStreet joint venture. The total value of the transaction is approximately $3.7 billion and will result in an after-tax gain to Citigroup upon closing of approximately $1.6 billion, both of which are subject to adjustment. Citigroup and Legg Mason have entered into a three-year global agreement under which Citigroup will continue to offer its clients Asset Management's products and in addition, inherit Legg Mason Wood Walker's position as the primary domestic provider of Legg Mason's equity fund family, including the top performing equity funds of Legg Mason Capital Management Inc. managed by Bill Miller. These will be offered through Citigroup's Global Wealth Management businesses, Smith Barney and the Citigroup Private Bank, as well as Primerica and Citibank. All offerings will be subject to usual suitability and performance standards. "We have been assessing our options for the Asset Management business and have found, in Legg Mason, a partner with an excellent product set that both complements and enhances our existing product offering to our customers," said Charles Prince, Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup. "In addition, we are adding 1,354 experienced financial advisors in 127 branch offices to our Wealth Management business. We are pleased to welcome the high quality team of financial professionals at Legg Mason to Citigroup. Deepening our relationships with clients is a top priority, and through this transaction, we are even better positioned to meet their investment needs. We are continuing to focus our resources on strengthening competitive advantages and building our leading businesses." "After careful review, we determined that our emphasis should continue to be on expanding access to best-in-class investment products, rather than on manufacturing proprietary asset management products," said Robert B. Willumstad, President and
Chief Operating Officer of Citigroup. "As part of Legg Mason, an industry leader solely focused on asset management, our Asset Management business will have increased opportunities to grow. We look forward to working with the Legg Mason team on behalf of our clients." The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. In connection with the transaction, Citigroup is seeking approval of Asset Management's mutual fund boards and shareholders. Citigroup was advised by Citigroup Corporate and Investment Banking and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.
