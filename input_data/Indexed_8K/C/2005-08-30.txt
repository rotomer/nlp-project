Notes
INTEREST
 
The Notes do not bear interest. No payments on the Notes will be made until the Stated Maturity Date.
 
PAYMENT AT MATURITY
 
The Notes will mature on March 2, 2009. On the Stated Maturity Date, Holders of the Notes will receive for each Note the Maturity Payment described below.
 
DETERMINATION OF THE MATURITY PAYMENT
 
The Maturity Payment for each Note equals the sum of the initial principal amount of $10 per Note plus the Interest Distribution Amount.
 
The "" is calculated as follows:
Interest Distribution Amount
 
 
 
 
The "" will equal the following fraction:
Index Return
 
 
The "" will equal the arithmetic average of all monthly Ending Values.
Average Ending Value
 
The "" for each Valuation Date will be the closing value of the Russell 1000 Growth Index on such Valuation Date or, if that day is not an Index Business Day, the closing value on the immediately following Index Business Day.
Ending Value
 
The "" is 494.88, the closing value of the Russell 1000 Growth Index on August 25, 2005.
Starting Value
 
"" occur on the 25th day of each month, commencing September 25, 2005 and ending on February 25, 2009.
Valuation Dates
 
An "" means a day, as determined by the calculation agent, on which the Index or any successor index is calculated and published and on which securities comprising more than 80% of the value of the Index on such day are capable of being traded on their relevant exchanges during the one-half hour before the determination of the closing value of the Index. All
Index Business Day
 
determinations made by the calculation agent will be at the sole discretion of the calculation agent and will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the beneficial owners of the Notes, absent manifest error.
 
A "" means, as determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion, the occurrence or existence of any suspension of or limitation imposed on trading (by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by any relevant exchange or market or otherwise) of, or the unavailability, through a recognized system of public dissemination of transaction information, for a period longer than two hours, or during the one-half hour period preceding the close of trading, on the applicable exchange or market, of accurate price, volume or related information in respect of (a) stocks which then comprise 20% or more of the value of the Index or any successor index, (b) any options or futures contracts, or any options on such futures contracts relating to the Index or any successor index, or (c) any options or futures contracts relating to stocks which then comprise 20% or more of the value of the Index or any successor index on any exchange or market if, in each case, in the determination of the calculation agent, any such suspension, limitation or unavailability is material. For the purpose of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists at any time, if trading in a security included in the Index is materially suspended or materially limited at that time, then the relevant percentage contribution of that security to the value of the Index will be based on a comparison of the portion of the value of the Index attributable to that security relative to the overall value of the Index, in each case immediately before that suspension or limitation.
Market Disruption Event
 
If no closing value of the Index is available on any Index Business Day because of a Market Disruption Event or otherwise, the value of the Index for that Index Business Day, unless deferred by the calculation agent as described below, will be the arithmetic mean, as determined by the calculation agent, of the value of the Index obtained from as many dealers in equity securities (which may include Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or any of the Company's other affiliates), but not exceeding three such dealers, as will make such value available to the calculation agent. The determination of the value of the Index by the calculation agent in the event of a Market Disruption Event may be deferred by the calculation agent for up to five consecutive Index Business Days on which a Market Disruption Event is occurring, but not past the Index Business Day prior to the Stated Maturity Date.
 
DISCONTINUANCE OF THE RUSSELL 1000 GROWTH INDEX
 
If Frank Russell Company ("") discontinues publication of the Index or if it or another entity publishes a successor or substitute index that the calculation agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to the Index, then the Ending Value of any succeeding Valuation Date will be determined by reference to the value of that index, which is referred to as a "."
Russell
successor index
 
Upon any selection by the calculation agent of a successor index, the calculation agent will cause notice to be furnished to the Company and the Trustee, who will provide notice of the selection of the successor index to the registered Holders of the Notes.
 
If Russell discontinues publication of the Index and a successor index is not selected by the calculation agent or is no longer published on any Valuation Date, the index value to be substituted for the Index for that Valuation Date will be a value computed by the calculation agent for that Valuation Date in accordance with the procedures last used to calculate the Index prior to any such discontinuance.
 
If Russell discontinues publication of the Index prior to the determination of the Interest Distribution Amount and the calculation agent determines that no successor index is available at that time, then on each Index Business Day until the earlier to occur of (a) the determination of the Interest Distribution Amount and (b) a determination by the calculation agent that a successor index is available, the calculation agent will determine the value that is to be used in computing the Interest Distribution Amount as described in the preceding paragraph as if such day were a Valuation Date. The calculation agent will cause notice of each such value to be published not less often than once each month in (or another newspaper of general circulation).
The Wall Street Journal
 
If a successor index is selected or the calculation agent calculates a value as a substitute for the Index as described above, the successor index or value will be substituted for the Index for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether an Index Business Day or Market Disruption Event occurs.
 
All determinations made by the calculation agent will be at the sole discretion of the calculation agent and will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company, the Guarantor and the beneficial owners of the Notes, absent manifest error.
 
ALTERATION OF METHOD OF CALCULATION
 
If at any time the method of calculating the Index or a successor index is changed in any material respect, or if the Index or a successor index is in any other way modified so that the value of the Index or the successor index does not, in the opinion of the calculation agent, fairly represent the value of that index had the changes or modifications not been made, then, from and after that time, the calculation agent will, at the close of business in New York, New York, make those adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the calculation agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a calculation of a value of a stock index comparable to the Index or the successor index as if the changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the closing value with reference to the Index or the successor index. Accordingly, if the method of calculating the Index or the successor index is modified so that the value of the Index or the successor index is a fraction or a multiple of what it would have been if it had not been modified (, due to a split in the Index), then the calculation agent will adjust that index in order to arrive at a value of the index as if it had not been modified (, as if the split had not occurred).
