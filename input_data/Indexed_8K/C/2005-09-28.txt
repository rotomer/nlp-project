in writing and the Indemnifying Party, upon request of the Indemnified Party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to represent the Indemnified Party and any others the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any Indemnified Party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Underwriters and all persons, if any who control any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or who are affiliates of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Act, (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Company Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section, (iii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Selling Stockholder and all persons, if any, who control the Selling Stockholder within the meaning of either such Section or (iv) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for Funding and the Guarantor, their directors, their officers who sign the Funding Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls Funding or the Guarantor within the meaning of either such Section, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriters and such control persons and affiliates of any Underwriters, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representative. In the case of any such separate firm for the Company and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. In the case of any such separate firm for the Selling Stockholder and such control persons of the Selling Stockholder, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Selling Stockholder. In the case of any such separate firm for Funding and the Guarantor and such directors, officers and control persons of Funding or the Guarantor, such firm shall be designated in writing by Funding and the Guarantor. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
 
(f) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 12(a), 12(b), 12(c) or 12(d) is unavailable to an Indemnified Party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to under such paragraph, then each Indemnifying Party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) if the Indemnifying Party is Funding, the Guarantor, the Company or the Selling Stockholder, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Indemnifying Party or parties on the one hand and the Indemnified Party or parties on the other hand from the offering of the SynDECS, (ii) if the indemnifying person is an Underwriter, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of such Underwriter on the one hand and the Indemnified Party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities or (iii) if the allocation provided by clause 12(f)(i) or 12(f)(ii) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 12(f)(i) above or the relative fault referred to in clause 12(f)(ii) but also the relative fault (in cases covered by clause 12(f)(i)) or such relative benefits (in cases covered by clause 12(f)(ii)) of the Indemnifying Party or parties on the one hand and of the Indemnified Party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company or the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the SynDECS shall be deemed to be the total net proceeds from the offering of the SynDECS (before deducting expenses) received by Funding and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Funding Prospectus, bear to the aggregate public offering price of the SynDECS. The relative fault of the Company or the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by Funding, the Guarantor, the Company or the Selling Stockholder or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 12 are several in proportion to the respective number of SynDECS they have purchased hereunder, and not joint. The liability of the Selling Stockholder under the contribution agreement contained in this paragraph shall be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate public offering price of the SynDECS sold under this Agreement.
 
(g) The Company, the Selling Stockholder, Funding, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 12 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 12(f). The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities
pro rata
 
referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 12, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the SynDECS underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 12 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Party at law or in equity.
 
(h) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 12 and the representations, warranties and other statements of Funding, the Guarantor, the Company and the Selling Stockholder contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter, by or on behalf of the Selling Stockholder or any person controlling the Selling Stockholder, by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company or by or on behalf of Funding and the Guarantor, each of their respective directors or any person controlling Funding and the Guarantor and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the SynDECS and the Principal Genworth Shares.
 
13. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the SynDECS agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of SynDECS set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate amount of SynDECS set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the SynDECS which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate amount of SynDECS which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of SynDECS set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the SynDECS, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the SynDECS, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter, Funding, the Guarantor, the Company or the Selling Stockholder. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 13, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Company Registration Statement, the Company Prospectus, the Funding Registration Statement and the Funding Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to Funding, the

Dear Sirs and Mesdames:
 
The undersigned understands that (1) Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Banc of America Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (the "Common Stock Representatives") propose to enter into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Common Stock Underwriting Agreement") with Genworth Financial, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and GE Financial Assurance Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Selling Stockholder"), providing for the public offering (the "Common Stock Offering") of shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"), and (2) Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (the "SynDECS Representative") propose to enter into an Underwriting Agreement (the "SynDECS Underwriting Agreement", and together with the Common Stock Underwriting Agreement, the "Underwriting Agreements") with the Company and the Selling Stockholder, providing for the public offering (the "SynDECS Offering", and together with the Common Stock Offering, the "Public Offerings") of Variable Rate Exchangeable Notes (the "SynDECS"), mandatorily exchangeable for Shares of Common Stock. The several underwriters of each Public Offering, including the Shares Representatives and the SynDECS Representative shall herein be referred to as the "Underwriters" .
 
To induce the Underwriters that may participate in the Public Offerings to continue their efforts in connection with the Public Offerings, the undersigned hereby agrees that, without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated on behalf of the underwriters of the Common Stock Offering, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., on behalf of the underwriters of the SynDECS Offering, it will not, during the period commencing on the date
hereof and ending 45 days after the date of the earlier of the final prospectuses relating to either of the Public Offerings (the "Lock-up Date"), (1) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock or (2) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Common Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (1) or (2) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise; provided, however, that each of the undersigned may offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, up to, but not more than, an aggregate of 50,000 shares of Common Stock in one or more transactions commencing on the date hereof and ending 45 days after the Lock-up Date. The foregoing restrictions on transfer shall not apply to (a) the transfer of any shares of Common Stock to an immediate family member of the undersigned or to a trust where the beneficiaries of the trust are drawn solely from a group consisting of the undersigned and immediate family members of the undersigned, (b) the transfer of any shares of Common Stock to a transferee as a bona fide gift or gifts, or (c) transactions relating to shares of Common Stock or other securities acquired in open market transactions after the completion of the Public Offerings; provided, however, that in the case of any transfer pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of this sentence, (i) the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this agreement and (ii) no filing by any party (donor, donee, transferor or transferee) under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, shall be required or shall be made voluntarily in connection with such transfer or distribution (other than a filing on a Form 5 made after the expiration of the 45 day period referred to above). Immediate family member of a person means the spouse, lineal descendants, father, mother, brother, sister, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law of such person. In addition, the undersigned agrees that, without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, on behalf of the underwriters of the Common Stock Offering, and CGMI, on behalf of the underwriters of the SynDECS Offering, it will not, during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending 45 days after the Lock-up Date, make any demand for or exercise any right with respect to, the registration of any shares of Common Stock or any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock. The undersigned also agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with the Company's transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of the undersigned's shares of Common Stock except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.
 
The undersigned understands that the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters are relying upon this agreement in proceeding toward consummation of the Public Offerings. The undersigned further understands that this agreement is irrevocable and shall be binding upon the undersigned's heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns. The undersigned understands that if the Underwriting Agreements shall not be entered into within 60 days of the date hereof or the Underwriting Agreements (other than the provisions thereof which survive termination) shall terminate or be terminated prior to payment for and delivery of the shares of Common Stock to be sold thereunder, the undersigned shall be released from all obligations under this agreement.
Whether or not the Public Offering actually occurs depends on a number of factors, including market conditions. Any Public Offering will only be made pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, the terms of which are subject to negotiation between the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters.

The primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial or quantitative information, and many determinations involved in the preparation of the Company Registration Statement and Company Prospectus are of a non-legal character. In addition, we have not undertaken any obligation to verify independently any of the factual matters set forth in the Company Registration Statement and Company Prospectus. Consequently, in this letter we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Company Registration Statement and Company Prospectus. Also, we do not make any statement herein with respect to any of the financial statements and related notes thereto, the financial statement schedules or the financial, statistical or accounting data contained in the Company Registration Statement and Company Prospectus.

Subject to the foregoing, we confirm to you that, on the basis of the information we gained in the course of performing the services referred to above, no facts have come to our attention which cause us to believe that (i) the Company Registration Statement or the Company Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Rules and Regulations thereunder, (ii) the Company Registration Statement, on the effective date thereof, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading or (iii) the Company Prospectus, as of its date or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

General
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debt securities of the Company (the "Debt Securities"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under a Senior Debt Indenture, dated as of June 1, 2005 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantor and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the holders of the SynDECS, and the terms upon which the SynDECS are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
 
If an Event of Default with respect to the SynDECS shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of the SynDECS may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. In such case, the amount declared due and payable upon any acceleration permitted by the Indenture will be equal to, with respect to this Note, the sum of the Daily Amounts for each of the 20 Trading Days immediately preceding but not including the date upon which the SynDECS are declared to be immediately due and payable. In case of default at Maturity of this Note, this Note shall continue to accrue interest, on the basis provided for in Paragraph 4 hereof, payable upon demand of the beneficial owners of this Note in accordance with the terms of the SynDECS, from and after Maturity through the date when the principal amount of this Note has been exchanged for shares of Genworth Class A Common Stock or other property (or the equivalent value in cash) in accordance with the Indenture.
 
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company, the Guarantor and the rights of the holders of the Debt Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company, the Guarantor and the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time Outstanding of each series affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Debt Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company and the Guarantor with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
The Holder of this Note may not enforce such Holder's rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company to pay the Maturity Payment with respect to this Note, and to pay any interest on any overdue amount thereof at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture but not in this Note shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
