Exhibit 99.1
        New York, NY, October 17, 2005Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) today reported net income for the third quarter of 2005 of $7.14 billion, or $1.38 per share. Return on common equity was 25.4%. Net income includes a $2.12 billion after-tax gain on the sale of life insurance and annuities, which closed in the third quarter.
        Income from continuing operations was $4.99 billion, or $0.97 per share.
(1)
Income from Discontinued Operations includes the results of substantially all of Asset Management, which is subject to a pending sale transaction, and a $2.12 billion after-tax gain on the sale of life insurance and annuities, which closed in the third quarter.
        "The strength of our business franchises continued to generate strong underlying financial results, despite a number of unusual charges this quarter," said Charles Prince, Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup. "Our results reflect excellent performance in our corporate and capital markets driven businesses. Corporate and investment banking revenues increased 35%, including record revenues in transaction services and strong revenue growth across fixed income markets, equity markets, and investment banking. In Smith Barney, revenues grew 13%. We also continued to generate robust customer volume growth in our international consumer franchise, where revenues increased 10%, as our investments are allowing us to reach more customers than ever before. Strength in these businesses helped offset sluggish revenue growth in our U.S. consumer franchise, where increased customer volumes were offset by continued spread compression and the impact of an increase in bankruptcy filings due to new legislation. The strength of our diversified platform also allowed us to absorb costs associated with Hurricane Katrina, as well as a year-over-year swing in credit costs of more than $1.6 billion," said Prince.
        "Since the terrible devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina, we have worked hard to provide substantial assistance to our affected customers. The Citigroup Foundation and our employees have pledged or donated more than $11.2 million to various relief organizations. We have waived loan fees and interest, totaling $25 million during the quarter, or restructured payments for our customers living in the affected areas. We have also recorded a $222 million after-tax charge this quarter, primarily to reflect the credit implications of the economic dislocation and hardship our customers are experiencing," said Prince.
        "We continue to allocate capital to our high growth and high return opportunities. During the quarter we opened 108 new branches and added 66 automated loan machines. We worked to strengthen our product capability locally and globally by investing in technology and people to better serve our growing customer base. We also increased the pace at which we repurchased our stock, acquiring over 124 million shares during the quarter at a cost of $5.5 billion," said Prince.
 - 
Franchise strength in corporate and capital markets driven businesses.
  Capital markets and banking achieved market share gains across several products, resulting in a #1 global rank in equity underwriting, debt underwriting, completed M&A, and syndicated loans during the third quarter. In transaction services, an expanded coverage effort and continued deepening of client relationships led to a 15% increase in assets under custody and 21% growth in liability balances. In Smith Barney, increased client activity during the normally slow summer months resulted in 10% growth in transactional revenues. Private equity gains drove continued strong performance in Alternative Investments.
 - 
International consumer franchise expansion.
  During the quarter, continued investment spending led to the opening of 69 new retail banking and consumer finance branches and 66 automated loan machines. Over the past 12 months, 308 new retail banking and consumer finance branches were opened or acquired and 235 automated loan machines were added. An expanded distribution network, as well as new product and marketing programs, drove strong volume and revenue growth during the quarter. Cards average receivables grew 15% and retail banking loans and investment product sales increased 8% and 33%, respectively. Outside of Japan, consumer finance loans rose 15%, including 61% growth in Asia. Net interest margins contracted modestly versus the third quarter of 2004 due to rising short-term interest rates and the competitive pricing environment. Income decline reflects a $490 million pre-tax charge to standardize loan write-off policies in EMEA retail banking and EMEA consumer finance with the global write-off policy.
 - 
North America consumer volume growth and spread compression.
  Increased customer participation in rewards programs and new deposit and loan initiatives contributed to 10% growth in card purchase sales and higher retail banking deposits and loans. In consumer finance, 4% receivables growth was driven by an increase in personal and auto loans. Slower growth in consumer finance receivables reflected an ongoing decision to avoid offering aggressively priced teaser rate and interest-only mortgage products to this customer segment. The benefits of volume growth during the quarter were offset by continued spread compression. Net interest margins improved from the second quarter of 2005 due to pricing actions.
 - 
Operating Expenses.
  Expenses increased 12%. Approximately three percentage points of the increase was due to increased investment spending, while the remainder was due to organic business growth and foreign exchange.
 - 
Summary of Highlighted Items.
  During the quarter, the following charges and benefits were recorded in continuing operations:
 - 
North America Cards
  
Revenues and income declined, as a 10% increase in purchase sales was offset by net interest margin compression and higher payment rates.
Mexico card revenues increased 55% and net income doubled, as target market expansion led to 64% growth in managed receivables.
Net credit margin decreased 1%, as continued favorable credit conditions were offset by the impact of an increase in bankruptcy filings due to new legislation, which added approximately $200 million pre-tax to credit costs.
Income decline also reflects a $110 million pre-tax charge related to Hurricane Katrina and the absence of a $160 million pre-tax unallocated loan loss reserve release recorded in the third quarter of 2004. Results in Mexico include a $41 million tax benefit from provisions of the Homeland Investment Act and a $27 million after-tax benefit due to a Value Added Tax refund in Mexico.
 - 
International Cards
  
Revenue growth reflects an 11% increase in purchase sales and 15% growth in average loans, with strong organic loan growth in Asia, EMEA and Latin America.
The NCL rate declined 130 basis points to 2.79%, as international credit trends continued to improve.
Income decline reflects the absence of a $42 million pre-tax unallocated loan loss reserve release recorded in the third quarter of 2004 and expense growth related to higher business volumes and investment spending.
 - 
North America Consumer Finance
  
Revenues increased 1% from the prior year period, as a 4% increase in average loans was offset by a 17 basis point decline in net interest margin. Spread compression was primarily driven by lower yields on the portfolio.
The net credit loss rate improved 23 basis points to 2.23%.
In Mexico, new branch openings totaled 22 during the quarter, and 81 over the last 12 months.
Income decline primarily reflects $180 million pre-tax of credit costs related to Hurricane Katrina and the absence of a $45 million pre-tax unallocated loan loss reserve release recorded in the third quarter of 2004.
 - 
International Consumer Finance
  
In Japan, income growth was primarily driven by lower expenses and continued credit improvement. During the quarter, 66 new automated loan machines were added.
Outside of Japan, 21% revenue growth was partially offset by increased investment spending, which led to the opening of 58 new branches during the quarter, including 43 in Asia. Over the last 12 months, 211 new branches were opened, including 120 in Asia.
Average loans increased 3%, reflecting a decline in Japan of 7% and growth outside of Japan of 15%.
The NCL ratio improved by 51 basis points to 6.01%. Credit costs include a $14 million pre-tax charge to standardize loan write-off policies in EMEA with the global write-off policy.
Income decline also reflects the absence of a $24 million pre-tax unallocated loan loss reserve release recorded in the third quarter of 2004.
 - 
North America Retail Banking
  
Results reflect growth in average customer deposits and loans of 7% and 20%, respectively, which was partially offset by continuing spread compression and the absence of previously sold portfolios in the commercial business. Loan growth reflected an increase in prime home finance average loans of 31%, as well as strong growth in retail distribution, commercial business core loans, and Mexico.
Mexico retail banking revenue and income increased significantly as deposits grew 11% and loans increased 26%.
Credit conditions remained favorable.
Commercial Business results include a $185 million pre-tax benefit due to settlement of litigation related to the purchase of Copelco in 2000.
Income growth includes the impact of a $60 million pre-tax charge related to Hurricane Katrina and the absence of a $164 million pre-tax unallocated loan loss reserve release recorded in the third quarter of 2004. Results in Mexico include a $66 million tax benefit from provisions of the Homeland Investment Act and a $79 million after-tax benefit due to a Value Added Tax refund in Mexico.
 - 
International Retail Banking
  
Revenue growth was driven by increased deposits and loans, up 7% and 8%, respectively, due to improved deposit product spreads and higher sales of investment products.
Expenses include continued investment spending, with 11 new branch openings during the quarter. New branch openings or acquisitions totaled 97 over the last 12 months.
Credit costs include a $476 million pre-tax charge to standardize loan write-off policies in EMEA with the global write-off policy.
(1)
Includes Global Crossing and other insurance recoveries of $90 million pre-tax ($54 million after-tax).
 - 
Capital Markets and Banking
  
Fixed income markets revenues increased 53%, driven by strong performance in interest rate products, foreign exchange and commodities.
Equity markets revenues increased 78%, driven by improved performance and growth in cash trading, alternative execution, and derivatives products.
Investment banking revenues increased 22%, driven by a 63% increase in advisory fees, which reflected strong growth in completed M&A transactions, and 45% growth in equity underwriting.
Credit costs increased $375 million, reflecting a $143 million pre-tax charge to increase loan loss reserves and the absence of a $202 million pre-tax unallocated loan loss reserve release recorded in the third quarter of 2004. The increase in loan loss reserves primarily reflects growth in unfunded commitments to corporate clients and weakness in auto credits.
Results also include a $70 million tax benefit from provisions of the Homeland Investment Act.
 - 
Transaction Services
  
Record revenues and net income were driven by higher customer volumes, reflecting increased liability balances held on behalf of customers, up 21%, and assets under custody, up 15%, and the positive impact of rising short-term interest rates.
Expenses increased 14%, reflecting the impact of new product introductions and higher business volumes. Operating margin grew from 32% to 35%.
Credit costs increased $76 million and reflect a $7 million pre-tax charge to increase loan loss reserves, and the absence of a $48 million pre-tax unallocated loan loss reserve release recorded in the third quarter of 2004.

 - 
Smith Barney

The pre-tax margin of 21% declined from the prior quarter, reflecting increased legal expenses.

Results reflect wind-down of the Japan business, which recorded a net loss of $29 million. Japan revenue and net income declined $46 million and $32 million, respectively, from the third quarter of 2004.
Excluding Japan, revenues increased 2%, as growth in customer volumes was offset by net interest margin compression.
Excluding the net loss in Japan, income declined 19%, as revenue growth was offset by investment spending on front office sales and support.
Client business volumes rose 3% to $218 billion, led by 15% growth in the U.S. and 10% growth in EMEA. Assets under fee-based management grew 6%.
 - 
Alternative Investments
  
Income of $339 million primarily reflects private equity gains and earnings on proprietary hedge fund investments.
        Corporate/Other results declined to a loss of $177 million, which reflected the absence of a $147 million tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2004, and marginally improved treasury results as lower funding requirements offset the impact of higher short-term interest rates.
(1)
International results for the quarter are fully reflected in the product disclosures.
 - 
Mexico
  
Consumer income growth reflects increased retail banking customer deposits and loans, up 11% and 26% respectively, and 64% growth in cards average receivables. Consumer results also reflect a $106 million after-tax benefit due to a Value Added Tax refund resulting from a favorable Mexican Supreme Court ruling, and a $107 million tax benefit from provisions of the Homeland Investment Act.
Corporate and Investment Banking income declined as increased corporate customer activity and improved treasury results were offset by increased credit costs.

Results also reflect a $490 million pre-tax charge to standardize loan write-off policies in retail banking and consumer finance with the global write-off policy.
Corporate and Investment Banking results reflect strong revenue growth, driven by increased customer activity across equity and fixed income markets and investment banking, and record revenues in transaction services. Credit costs include a $44 million pre-tax charge to increase loan loss reserves, primarily reflecting portfolio growth, longer maturities in unfunded commitments, and slightly lower credit quality. Results also include a $22 million tax benefit from provisions of the Homeland Investment Act.
 - 
Japan
  
Consumer income increased primarily due to reduced expenses and lower credit costs in consumer finance. Retail Banking income declined as revenue growth was offset by increased costs related to implementation of expanded control and compliance procedures.
Corporate and Investment Banking income declined as improved results in equity markets, due to higher customer activity, were offset by a decline in fixed income market revenues.
Wealth Management results reflect the continued wind-down of the private bank operations.
 - 
Asia

During the quarter, 46 new branches were opened, consisting of 43 consumer finance and 3 retail banking branches.

 - 
Latin America
  
Consumer results reflect double-digit revenue growth in cards, consumer finance, and retail banking, driven by increased receivables balances.

Credit conditions remained favorable. During the quarter, 14 new branches were opened, consisting of 10 consumer finance and 4 retail banking branches.
Corporate and Investment Banking results reflect double-digit revenue growth in fixed income markets and transaction services, partially offset by lower lending revenues and higher credit costs. Credit costs increased due to the absence of an $83 million pre-tax

The abbreviated income statement presented above is prepared on a managed basis (a non-GAAP measure), and includes the effect of securitizations in Adjusted Revenues, Net of Interest Expense and Adjusted Net Credit Losses. This income statement reconciles to Net Income which is a GAAP measure. Securitization changes Citigroup's role from that of a lender to that of a loan servicer and removes the receivables from Citigroup's balance sheet. For securitized receivables, amounts that would otherwise be reported as net interest revenue, fee and commission revenue, and credit losses are replaced by the contractual servicing and excess servicing fees earned. However, Citigroup's exposure to credit losses on the securitized receivables is contractually limited to the cash flows from the receivables. The managed basis disclosures treat the receivables as if they had not been securitized and are still on the Company's balance sheet, with related income statement amounts reported as net interest revenue, fee and commission revenue, and credit losses. Although a managed basis presentation is not in conformity with GAAP, the Company believes it provides a representation of performance and key indicators of the credit card business that is consistent with the way management reviews operating performance and allocates resources. Furthermore, investors utilize information about the credit quality of the entire managed portfolio as the results of both the held and securitized portfolios impact the overall performance of the Cards business.

NOTEThe above supplemental information reflects the Company's consolidated period ending GAAP balance sheet broken out by reporting segment. The respective segment information closely depicts the assets and liabilities managed by each segment. While this presentation is not defined by GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles), the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors understanding of the balance sheet components managed by the underlying business segments as well as the beneficial interrelationship of the asset and liability dynamics of the balance sheet components among the Company's business segments. The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance. The table above provides the supplemental information and the corresponding GAAP financial measure at September 30, 2005.
This Segment Balance Sheet closely depicts the assets and liabilities managed by each of the respective business segments. The reported balances have been derived from the core financial reporting processes managed by the respective segment's finance organization. Adjustments have been made, where they are significant, to balances managed by one segment's financial infrastructure on behalf of another segment's customer base.

CITIGROUPRETURN ON CAPITAL(1)

Risk Capital is defined as the amount of capital needed to cover unexpected economic losses during extreme events. Return on Risk Capital is defined as income divided by Risk Capital. Return on Invested Capital is a similar calculation but includes adjustments for goodwill and intangibles in both the numerator and denominator, similar to those necessary to translate return on tangible equity to return on total equity. Return on Risk Capital and Return on Invested Capital are non-GAAP performance measures. Management believes Return on Risk Capital is useful to make incremental investment decisions and serves as a key metric for organic growth initiatives. Return on Invested Capital is used for multi-year investment decisions and as a long term performance measure.
