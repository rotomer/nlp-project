Item 8.01    Other Events.
        Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by reference herein is the Historical Financial Data Supplement of Citigroup Inc. and subsidiaries, reflecting the reorganization of the Company's Global Consumer Group and providing historical results for the Global Consumer Group under the new organization structure.
        In September 2005, Citigroup announced the reorganization of the Global Consumer Group. Specifically, North America Cards, Consumer Finance and Retail Banking have been reorganized into U.S. Cards, Retail Distribution, Consumer Lending and Commercial Business. In addition, Mexico consumer results, which were previously recorded in North America, are now recorded in International.
        Citigroup's fourth quarter 2005 financial results will reflect these changes.
        Below is a summary description of each of the reorganized U.S. Consumer businesses.
U.S. Cards
        The U.S. Cards business has effectively remained the same; however as referenced above, Mexico results are now reported in International Cards. Further, the U.S. Cards income statement presents all information on a GAAP basis, and therefore no longer reflects adjustments to Total Revenues and Net Credit Losses related to securitization activities. Performance metrics for the entire credit card portfolio, both held and securitized, are included under "Key IndicatorsManaged Basis."
U.S. Retail Distribution
        The U.S. Retail Distribution business is comprised of Citibank branches, CitiFinancial branches and Primerica Financial Services. Citibank branches provide personal and small business banking products and services; CitiFinancial branches provide consumer loan products and services; and Primerica Financial Services provides financial products and services through independent agents.
U.S. Consumer Lending
        U.S. Consumer Lending provides consumer loans through various distribution channels. Loan products are grouped into three categories:
 - 
Provides mortgage and home equity lending. Loans are originated directly with consumers via the telephone, internet, Smith Barney, Citibank branches and Primerica agents, and indirectly through mortgage brokers, banks and mortgage companies.
Real Estate Lending
 - 
Provides educational loans to students. Loans are typically sourced through financial aid offices at educational institutions. Also provides government loan origination and servicing capabilities to student loan providers, including academic and financial institutions.
Student Loans
 - 
Provides automobile financing through franchised and independent auto dealers, auto manufacturers, and the internet.
Auto
U.S. Commercial Business
        U.S. Commercial Business provides leasing, banking and real estate products and services to small and medium-sized enterprises across a broad range of industries. Commercial Business has effectively remained the same. Results for Commercial Business were previously reported as a separate line in North America Retail Banking.
Mapping From Prior Disclosure to New Disclosure
        The below information maps the prior disclosure to the new disclosure for the Global Consumer Group.

Mexico is now reported in International Consumer results.
