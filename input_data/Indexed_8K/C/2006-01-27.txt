This Note is one of the series of 1,925,000 Index LeAding StockmarkEt Return Securities (Index LASERS
SM
) Based Upon the S&P 500 Index (the "") Due January 27, 2010 (the "").
Index
Index LASERS
 
INTEREST
 
The Index LASERS do not bear interest. No payments on the Index LASERS will be made until the Stated Maturity Date.
 
PAYMENT AT MATURITY
 
The Index LASERS will mature on January 27, 2010. On the Stated Maturity Date, Holders of the Index LASERS will receive for each Index LASERS the Maturity Payment described below.
 
DETERMINATION OF THE MATURITY PAYMENT
 
The Maturity Payment for each Index LASERS equals the sum of the initial principal amount of $10 per Index LASERS plus the Index Return Amount.
 
The "" is calculated as follows:
Index Return Amount
 
 
$10 * Upside Participation Rate * Index Return
 
 
 
    $10 * Index Return
 
 
 
The "" equals:
Index Return
 
 
The "" is 110%.
Upside Participation Rate
 
The "" is 1266.86, the closing value of the Index on January 24, 2006.
Starting Value
 
The "" will be the closing value of the Index on the third Index Business Day before the Stated Maturity Date.
Ending Value
 
If no closing value of the Index is available on the third Index Business Day before the Stated Maturity Date because of a Market Disruption Event or otherwise, the value of the Index for that Index Business Day, unless deferred by the calculation agent as described below, will be the arithmetic mean, as determined by the calculation agent, of the value of the Index obtained from as many dealers in equity securities (which may include Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or any of the Company's other affiliates), but not exceeding three such dealers, as will make such value available to the calculation agent. The determination of the value of the Index by the calculation agent in the event of a Market Disruption Event may be deferred by the calculation agent for up to five consecutive Index Business Days on which a Market Disruption Event is occurring, but not past the Index Business Day prior to the Stated Maturity Date.
 
An "" means a day, as determined by the calculation agent, on which the Index or any Successor Index is calculated and published and on which securities comprising more than 80% of the value of the Index on such day are capable of being traded on their relevant exchanges or markets during the one-half hour before the determination of the closing value of the Index. All determinations made by the calculation agent will be at the sole discretion of the calculation agent and will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company, the Guarantor and the beneficial owners of the Index LASERS, absent manifest error.
Index Business Day
 
A "" means, as determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion, the occurrence or existence of any suspension of or limitation imposed on trading (by reason of movements in price exceeding limits permitted by any relevant exchange or market or otherwise) of, or the unavailability, through a recognized system of public dissemination of transaction information, for a period longer than two hours, or during the one-half hour period preceding the close of trading, on the applicable exchange or market, of accurate price, volume or related information in respect of (a) stocks which then comprise 20% or more of the value of the Index or any Successor Index, (b) any options or futures contracts, or any options on such futures contracts relating to the Index or any Successor Index, or (c) any options or futures contracts relating to stocks which then comprise 20% or more of the value of the Index or any Successor Index on any exchange or market if, in each case, in the determination of the calculation agent, any such suspension, limitation or unavailability is material. For the purpose of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists at any time, if trading in a security included in the Index is materially suspended or materially limited at that time, then the relevant percentage contribution of that security to the value of the Index will be based on a comparison of the portion of the value of the Index attributable to that security relative to the overall value of the Index, in each case immediately before that suspension or limitation.
Market Disruption Event
 
DISCONTINUANCE OF THE INDEX
 
If Standard & Poor's ("") discontinues publication of the Index or if it or another entity publishes a successor or substitute index that the calculation agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to the Index, then the value of the Index will be determined by reference to the value of that index, which is referred to as a ""
S&P
Successor Index.
 
Upon any selection by the calculation agent of a Successor Index, the calculation agent will cause notice to be furnished to the Company and the Trustee, who will provide notice of the selection of the Successor Index to the registered holders of the Index LASERS.
 
If S&P discontinues publication of the Index and a Successor Index is not selected by the calculation agent or is no longer published on any date of determination of the value of the Index, the value to be substituted for the Index for that date will be a value computed by the calculation agent for that date in accordance with the procedures last used to calculate the Index prior to any such discontinuance.
 
If S&P discontinues publication of the Index prior to the determination of the Index Return Amount and the calculation agent determines that no Successor Index is available at that time, then on each Index Business Day until the earlier to occur of (a) the determination of the Index Return Amount and (b) a determination by the calculation agent that a Successor Index is available, the calculation agent will determine the value that is to be used in computing the value of the Index as described in the preceding paragraph. The calculation agent will cause notice of daily closing values to be published not less often than once each month in (or another newspaper of general circulation). Notwithstanding these alternative arrangements, discontinuance of the publication of the Index may adversely affect trading in the Index LASERS.
The Wall Street Journal
 
If a Successor Index is selected or the calculation agent calculates a value as a substitute for the Index as described above, the Successor Index or value will be substituted for the Index for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether an Index Business Day or Market Disruption Event occurs. Notwithstanding these alternative arrangements, discontinuance of the publication of the Index may adversely affect the market value of the Index LASERS.
 
All determinations made by the calculation agent will be at the sole discretion of the calculation agent and will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company, the Guarantor and the beneficial owners of the Index LASERS, absent manifest error.
 
ALTERATION OF METHOD OF CALCULATION
 
If at any time the method of calculating the Index or any Successor Index is changed in any material respect, or if the Index or any Successor Index is in any other way modified so that the value of the Index or the Successor Index does not, in the opinion of the calculation agent, fairly represent the value of that index had the changes or modifications not been made, then, from and after that time, the calculation agent will, at the close of business in New York, New York, make those adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the calculation agent, may be
 
necessary in order to arrive at a calculation of a value of a stock index comparable to the Index or the Successor Index as if the changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the value of the index with reference to the Index or the Successor Index. Accordingly, if the method of calculating the Index or the Successor Index is modified so that the value of the Index or the Successor Index is a fraction or a multiple of what it would have been if it had not been modified, then the calculation agent will adjust that index in order to arrive at a value of the index as if it had not been modified.

Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
 
The holder of this Note may not enforce such holder's rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Index LASERS except as provided in the Indenture. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the
 
Company and the Guarantor to pay the Maturity Payment with respect to this Note, and to pay any interest on any overdue amount thereof at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
