DILUTION ADJUSTMENTS
If Texas Instruments Inc., after February 22, 2006,
(1) pays a stock dividend or makes a distribution with respect to its common stock in shares of the stock,
(2) subdivides or splits the outstanding shares of its common stock into a greater number of shares,
(3) combines the outstanding shares of the common stock into a smaller number of shares, or
(4) issues by reclassification of shares of its common stock any shares of other common stock of Texas Instruments Inc.,
then, in each of these cases, the Exchange Ratio will be multiplied by a dilution adjustment equal to a fraction, the numerator of which will be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after the event, plus, in the case of a reclassification referred to in (4) above, the number of shares of other common stock of Texas Instruments Inc., and the denominator of which will be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately before the event. The Initial Share Price and the Downside Trigger Price will also be adjusted in that case in the manner described below.
If Texas Instruments Inc., after February 22, 2006, issues, or declares a record date in respect of an issuance of, rights or warrants to all holders of its common stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of its common stock at a price per share less than the Then-Current Market Price of the common stock, other than rights to purchase common stock pursuant to a plan for the reinvestment of dividends or interest, then, in each case, the Exchange Ratio will be multiplied by a dilution adjustment equal to a fraction, the numerator of which will be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately before the adjustment is effected, plus the number of additional shares of common stock offered for subscription or purchase pursuant to the rights or warrants, and the denominator of which will be the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately before the adjustment is effected by reason of the issuance of the rights or warrants, plus the number of additional shares of common stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of common stock offered for subscription or purchase pursuant to the rights or warrants would purchase at the Then-Current Market Price of the common stock, which will be determined by multiplying the total number of
 
shares so offered for subscription or purchase by the exercise price of the rights or warrants and dividing the product obtained by the Then-Current Market Price. To the extent that, after the expiration of the rights or warrants, the shares of common stock offered thereby have not been delivered, the Exchange Ratio will be further adjusted to equal the Exchange Ratio which would have been in effect had the adjustment for the issuance of the rights or warrants been made upon the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of common stock actually delivered. The Initial Share Price and the Downside Trigger Price will also be adjusted in that case in the manner described below.
If Texas Instruments Inc., after February 22, 2006, declares or pays a dividend or makes a distribution to all holders of the common stock of any class of its capital stock, the capital stock of one or more of its subsidiaries, evidences of its indebtedness or other non-cash assets, excluding any dividends or distributions referred to in the above paragraph and excluding any issuance or distribution to all holders of its common stock, in the form of Marketable Securities, of capital stock of one or more of its subsidiaries, or issues to all holders of its common stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any of its or one or more of its subsidiaries' securities, other than rights or warrants referred to in the above paragraph, then, in each of these cases, the Exchange Ratio will be multiplied by a dilution adjustment equal to a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Then-Current Market Price of one share of the common stock, and the denominator of which will be the Then-Current Market Price of one share of the common stock, less the fair market value (as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company, whose determination will be final) as of the time the adjustment is effected of the portion of the capital stock, assets, evidences of indebtedness, rights or warrants so distributed or issued applicable to one share of common stock. The Initial Share Price and the Downside Trigger Price will also be adjusted in that case in the manner described below. If any capital stock declared or paid as a dividend or otherwise distributed or issued to all holders of Texas Instruments common stock consists, in whole or in part, of Marketable Securities, then the fair market value of such Marketable Securities will be determined by the calculation agent by reference to the Trading Price of such capital stock. The fair market value of any other distribution or issuance referred to in this paragraph will be determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company, whose determination will be final.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, with respect to any dividend or distribution to which the above paragraph would otherwise apply, the denominator in the fraction referred to in the above formula is less than $1.00 or is a negative number, then the Company may, at its option, elect to have the adjustment provided by the above paragraph not be made and in lieu of this adjustment, the Trading Price of Texas Instruments common stock on any Trading Day thereafter up to and including the third Trading Day before the Stated Maturity Date will be deemed to be equal to the fair market value of the capital stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights or warrants (determined, as of the date this dividend or distribution is made, by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company, whose determination will be final) so distributed or issued applicable to one share of Texas Instruments common stock and, if the Trading Price of Texas Instruments common stock on any Trading Day thereafter, up to and including the third Trading Day before the Stated Maturity Date, is less than or equal to the Downside Trigger Price, each holder of the ELKS will
 
have the right to receive at the Stated Maturity Date cash in an amount per ELKS equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by such fair market value.
If Texas Instruments Inc., after February 22, 2006, declares a record date in respect of a distribution of cash, other than any Permitted Dividends described below, any cash distributed in consideration of fractional shares of common stock and any cash distributed in a Reorganization Event referred to below, by dividend or otherwise, to all holders of its common stock, or makes an Excess Purchase Payment, then the Exchange Ratio will be multiplied by a dilution adjustment equal to a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Then-Current Market Price of the common stock, and the denominator of which will be the Then-Current Market Price of the common stock on the record date less the amount of the distribution applicable to one share of common stock which would not be a Permitted Dividend, or, in the case of an Excess Purchase Payment, less the aggregate amount of the Excess Purchase Payment for which adjustment is being made at the time divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the record date. The Initial Share Price and the Downside Trigger Price will also be adjusted in that case in the manner described below.
For the purposes of these adjustments:
A "" is any cash dividend in respect of Texas Instruments common stock, other than a cash dividend that exceeds the immediately preceding cash dividend, and then only to the extent that the per share amount of this dividend results in an annualized dividend yield on the common stock in excess of 10%.
Permitted Dividend
An "" is the excess, if any, of (x) the cash and the value (as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company, whose determination will be final) of all other consideration paid by Texas Instruments Inc. with respect to one share of common stock acquired in a tender offer or exchange offer by Texas Instruments Inc., over (y) the Then-Current Market Price of the common stock.
Excess Purchase Payment
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, with respect to any dividend, distribution or Excess Purchase Payment to which the sixth paragraph in this section would otherwise apply, the denominator in the fraction referred to in the formula in that paragraph is less than $1.00 or is a negative number, then the Company may, at its option, elect to have the adjustment provided by the sixth paragraph in this section not be made and in lieu of this adjustment, the Trading Price of Texas Instruments common stock on any Trading Day thereafter up to and including the third Trading Day before the Stated Maturity Date will be deemed to be equal to the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of other consideration (determined, as of the date this dividend or distribution is made, by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company, whose determination will be final) so distributed or applied to the acquisition of the common stock in the tender offer or exchange offer applicable to one share of Texas Instruments common stock and, if the Trading Price of Texas Instruments common stock on any Trading Day thereafter, up to and including the third Trading Day before the Stated Maturity Date, is less than or equal to
 
the Downside Trigger Price, each holder of the ELKS will have the right to receive at the Stated Maturity Date cash in an amount per ELKS equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by such sum.
If any adjustment is made to the Exchange Ratio as set forth above, an adjustment will also be made to the Initial Share Price and the Downside Trigger Price. The required adjustment will be made by dividing the Initial Share Price and the Downside Trigger Price by the relevant dilution adjustment.
If Texas Instruments Inc., after February 22, 2006, issues or makes a distribution to all holders of its common stock of the capital stock of one or more of its subsidiaries, in each case in the form of Marketable Securities, and if the Trading Price on any Trading Day after February 22, 2006 up to and including the third Trading Day before the Stated Maturity Date (whether intra-day or at the close of trading on any day) is less than or equal to the Downside Trigger Price, then, in each of these cases, each holder of the ELKS will receive at the Stated Maturity Date for each ELKS a combination of shares of Texas Instruments common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio and a number of shares of such Texas Instruments subsidiaries' capital stock equal to the Exchange Ratio times the number of shares of such subsidiaries' capital stock distributed per share of Texas Instruments common stock. Following the record date for an event described in this paragraph, the "Trading Price" will equal the Trading Price of Texas Instruments common stock, plus the Trading Price of such subsidiaries' capital stock times the number of shares of such subsidiaries' capital stock distributed per share of Texas Instruments common stock. In the event a distribution pursuant to this paragraph occurs, following the record date for such distribution, the adjustments described in "Dilution Adjustments" will also apply to such subsidiaries' capital stock if any of the events described in "Dilution Adjustments" occurs with respect to such capital stock.
Each dilution adjustment will be effected as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
All dilution adjustments will be rounded upward or downward to the nearest 1/10,000th or, if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th, to the next lower 1/10,000th. No adjustment in the Exchange Ratio will be required unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein, provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this sentence are not required to be made will be carried forward (on a percentage basis) and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. If any announcement or declaration of a record date in respect of a dividend, distribution, issuance or repurchase requiring an adjustment as described herein is subsequently canceled by Texas Instruments Inc., or this dividend, distribution, issuance or repurchase fails to receive requisite approvals or fails to occur for any other reason, then, upon the cancellation, failure of approval or failure to occur, the Exchange Ratio, the Initial Share Price and the Downside Trigger Price will be further adjusted to the Exchange Ratio, the Initial Share Price and the Downside Trigger Price which would then have been in effect had adjustment for the event not been made. If a Reorganization Event described below occurs after the occurrence of one or more events requiring an adjustment as described herein, the dilution adjustments previously applied to the Exchange Ratio will not be rescinded but will be applied to the Reorganization Event as provided for below.
The "" of the common stock, for the purpose of applying any dilution adjustment, means the average Closing Price per share of common stock for the ten Trading Days immediately before this adjustment is effected or, in the case of an adjustment effected at the opening of business on the Business Day next following a record date, immediately before the earlier of the date the adjustment is effected and the related Ex-Date. For purposes of determining the Then-Current Market Price, the determination of the Closing Price by the calculation agent in the event of a Market Disruption Event, as described in the definition of Closing Price, may be deferred by the calculation agent for up to five consecutive Trading Days on which a Market Disruption Event is occurring, but not past the Trading Day prior to the Stated Maturity Date.
Then-Current Market Price
The "" of Texas Instruments common stock (or any other security for which a Closing Price must be determined) on any date of determination will be (1) if the common stock or other security is listed on a national securities exchange on that date of determination, the closing sale price or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price on that date on the principal U.S. exchange on which the common stock or other security is listed or admitted to trading, (2) if the common stock or other security is not listed on a national securities exchange on that date of determination, or if the closing sale price or last reported sale price is not obtainable (even if the common stock or other security is listed or admitted to trading on such exchange), and the common stock or other security is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market, the closing sale price or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price on that date as reported on the Nasdaq, and (3) if the common stock or other security is not quoted on the Nasdaq on that date of determination or, if the closing sale price or last reported sale price is not obtainable (even if the common stock or other security is quoted on the Nasdaq), the last quoted bid price for the common stock or other security in the over-the-counter market on that date as reported by the OTC Bulletin Board, the National Quotation Bureau or a similar organization. The determination of the Closing Price by the calculation agent in the event of a Market Disruption Event may be deferred by the calculation agent for up to five consecutive Trading Days on which a Market Disruption Event is occurring, but not past the Trading Day
Closing Price
 
prior to the Stated Maturity Date. If no closing sale price or last reported sale price is available pursuant to clauses (1), (2) or (3) above or if there is a Market Disruption Event, the Closing Price on any date of determination, unless deferred by the calculation agent as described in the preceding sentence, will be the arithmetic mean, as determined by the calculation agent, of the bid prices of the common stock or other security obtained from as many dealers in such security (which may include Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or any of our other subsidiaries or affiliates), but not exceeding three such dealers, as will make such bid prices available to the calculation agent. A security "quoted on the Nasdaq National Market" will include a security included for listing or quotation in any successor to such system and the term "OTC Bulletin Board" will include any successor to such service. If, during any period of ten Trading Days used to calculate the Then-Current Market Price, there occurs any event requiring an adjustment to be effected as described herein, then the Closing Price for each Trading Day in such period of ten Trading Days occurring prior to the day on which such adjustment is effected will be adjusted by being divided by the relevant dilution adjustment.
The "" relating to any dividend, distribution or issuance is the first date on which the shares of the common stock trade in the regular way on their principal market without the right to receive this dividend, distribution or issuance.
Ex-Date
In the event of any of the following ":"
Reorganization Events
 
 
 
 
the Trading Price of Texas Instruments common stock on any Trading Day thereafter up to and including the third Trading Day before the Stated Maturity Date will be deemed to be equal to the Transaction Value.
The "" will be the sum of:
Transaction Value
 
(1) for any cash received in a Reorganization Event, the amount of cash received per share of common stock,
(2) for any property other than cash or Marketable Securities received in a Reorganization Event, an amount equal to the market value on the date the Reorganization Event is consummated of that property received per share of common stock, as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company, whose determination will be final, and
(3) for any Marketable Securities received in a Reorganization Event, an amount equal to the Closing Price per share of these Marketable Securities on the applicable Trading Day multiplied by the number of these Marketable Securities received for each share of common stock.
"" are any perpetual equity securities or debt securities with a stated maturity after the Stated Maturity Date, in each case that are listed on a U.S. national securities exchange or reported by the Nasdaq National Market. The number of shares of any equity securities constituting Marketable Securities included in the calculation of Transaction Value pursuant to clause (3) above will be adjusted if any event occurs with respect to the Marketable Securities or the issuer of the Marketable Securities between the time of the Reorganization Event and the Stated Maturity Date that would have required an adjustment as described above, had it occurred with respect to Texas Instruments common stock or Texas Instruments Inc. Adjustment for these subsequent events will be as nearly equivalent as practicable to the adjustments described above.
Marketable Securities
If Texas Instruments common stock has been subject to a Reorganization Event and the Trading Price of Texas Instruments common stock on any Trading Day thereafter, up to and including the third Trading Day before the Stated Maturity Date, is less than or equal to the Downside Trigger Price, then each holder of the ELKS will have the right to receive per $10 principal amount of ELKS (i) cash in an amount equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the sum of clauses (1) and (2) in the definition of "Transaction Value" above and (ii) the number of Marketable Securities received for each share of stock in the Reorganization Event multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.
