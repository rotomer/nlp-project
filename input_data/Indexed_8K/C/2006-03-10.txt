For the purposes of this provision, the expression an "offer of notes to the public" in relation to any Securities in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Securities to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Securities, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State and the expression "Prospectus Directive" means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.

Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation (the "Depository"), to the Company or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of the Depository (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of the Depository), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.

The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such interest, which shall be the April 15 or October 15 (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holder on such Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a subsequent Record Date, such subsequent Record Date to be not less than five days prior to the date of payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to holders of Notes of this series not less than 15 days prior to such subsequent Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture. In the case of any period of less than six months and any date other than an Interest Payment Date, interest hereon will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the relevant period and a year of 365 days. If either a date for payment of principal or interest on the Notes or the Maturity of the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the related payment of principal or interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day as if made on the date the payment was due. No interest will accrue on any amounts payable for the period from and after the date for payment of principal or interest on the Notes or the Maturity of the Notes. For these purposes, "Business Day" means any day which is a day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and are open for general business (including dealings in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits) in (a) the relevant place of payment and (b) each of The City of New York, Tokyo and London. Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in London or The City of New York in Japanese Yen, provided that holders of interests in this Note through The Depository Trust Company will receive payment in United States dollars unless they make an election to receive payment in Japanese Yen in accordance with the procedures of The Depository Trust Company and the Fiscal Agency Agreement dated as of March 7, 2006 (the "Fiscal Agency Agreement"), in which case the exchange agent under the Fiscal Agency Agreement will convert the Japanese Yen paid by the Company into U.S. dollars in accordance with the Fiscal Agency Agreement. Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place. Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or by the authenticating agent on behalf of the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company (the "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under the Indenture, dated as of March 15, 1987 (as amended and supplemented to date, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of Y50,000,000,000 and increased to Y75,000,000,000. So long as the Notes of this series are in the form of Global Securities only, all Notes of this series will collectively be evidenced (a) by this Global Note and the Global Note for this series bearing registration number R-0001-DTC-A (together, the "DTC Global Notes") and (b) by the Global Securities of this series registered in the name of Citivic Nominees Limited and bearing registration number R-0002-INT and registration number R-0004-INT (together, the "International Global Notes"). The DTC Global Notes and the International Global Notes will at all times collectively represent the aggregate principal amount of this series outstanding from time to time. If at any time a portion of an International Global Note is exchanged for an interest in a DTC Global Note, the principal amount of such DTC Global Note shall be increased by the amount of such portion, and such DTC Global Note shall be endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests thereto to reflect such principal increase, subject to the limitation that in no event may the principal amount of either DTC Global Note be greater than the equivalent in U.S. dollars of $500,000,000. If at any time a portion of a DTC Global Note is exchanged for an interest in an International Global Note, the principal amount of such DTC Global Note shall be decreased by the amount of such portion, and such DTC Global Note shall be endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests thereto to reflect such principal decrease. To ascertain the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests attached to a DTC Global Note, inquiry shall be made of the exchange agent under the Fiscal Agency Agreement, and the U.S. dollar equivalent quoted by such exchange agent (and the date of such quote) shall be noted on such Schedule of Exchanges of Interests next to the corresponding Yen amount.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. This Note is a Global Security registered in the name of a nominee of the Depository. This Note is exchangeable for Notes registered in the name of a person other than the Depository or its nominee only in the limited circumstances hereinafter described. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for definitive Notes in certificated form, this Note may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository. The Notes represented by this Global Security are exchangeable for definitive Notes in certificated form of like tenor as such Notes in denominations of Y1,000,000 and integral multiples thereof only if (i) the Depository notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for the DTC Global Notes or (ii) the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or (iii) both the Euroclear System and Clearstream Banking, societe anonyme, notify the Company that they are unwilling or unable to continue as a clearing system for the International Global Note or (iv) the Company in its sole discretion decides to allow the Notes to be exchanged for definitive Notes in registered form. Any Notes that are exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence are exchangeable for certificated Notes issuable in authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Depository shall direct. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of definitive Notes in certificated form is registrable in the register maintained by the Company for such purpose, upon surrender of the definitive Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and interest on the definitive Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the registrar duly executed by, the holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. Subject to
the foregoing, this Note is not exchangeable, except for a Global Security or Global Securities of this issue of the same principal amount to be registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Company will pay additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") to the beneficial owner of any Note that is a non-United States person in order to ensure that every net payment on such Note will not be less, due to payment of U.S. withholding tax, than the amount then due and payable. For this purpose, a "net payment" on a Note means a payment by the Company or a paying agent, including payment of principal and interest, after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge of the United States. These Additional Amounts will constitute additional interest on the Note. The Company will not be required to pay Additional Amounts, however, in any of the circumstances described in items (1) through (12) below. (1) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the beneficial owner: (a) having a relationship with the United States as a citizen, resident or otherwise; (b) having had such a relationship in the past or (c) being considered as having had such a relationship. (2) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the beneficial owner: (a) being treated as present in or engaged in a trade or business in the United States; (b) being treated as having been present in or engaged in a trade or business in the United States in the past or (c) having or having had a permanent establishment in the United States. (3) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the beneficial owner being or having been a: (a) personal holding company;
(b) foreign personal holding company; (c) foreign private foundation or other foreign tax-exempt organization; (d) passive foreign investment company; (e) controlled foreign corporation or (f) corporation which has accumulated earnings to avoid United States federal income tax. (4) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the beneficial owner owning or having owned, actually or constructively, 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company entitled to vote. For purposes of item (1) through (4) above, "beneficial owner" means a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the holder if the holder is an estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, corporation or other entity, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder. (5) Additional Amounts will not be payable to any beneficial owner of a Note that is a: (a) fiduciary; (b) partnership; (c) limited liability company or (d) other fiscally transparent entity or that is not the sole beneficial owner of the Note, or any portion of the Note. However, this exception to the obligation to pay Additional Amounts will only apply to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor in relation to the fiduciary, or a beneficial owner or member of the partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, would not have been entitled to the payment of an Additional Amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment. (6) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the failure of the beneficial owner or any other person to comply with applicable certification, identification, documentation or other information reporting requirements. This exception to the obligation to pay Additional Amounts will only apply if compliance with such reporting requirements is required by statute or regulation of the United States or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge. (7) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is collected or imposed by any method other than by withholding from a payment on a Note by the Company or a paying agent.
(8) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of a change in law, regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later. (9) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the presentation by the beneficial owner of a Note for payment more than 30 days after the date on which such payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later. (10) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Note is reduced as a result of any: (a) estate tax; (b) inheritance tax; (c) gift tax; (d) sales tax; (e) excise tax; (f) transfer tax; (g) wealth tax; (h) personal property tax or (i) any similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge. (11) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from a payment of principal or interest on a Note if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other paying agent. (12) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Note is reduced as a result of any combination of items (1) through (11) above. Except as specifically provided herein, the Company will not be required to make any payment of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of such government. As used in this Note, "United States person" means: (a) any individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (b) any corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States; (c) any estate if the income of such estate falls within the federal income tax jurisdiction of the United States regardless of the source of such income and
(d) any trust if a United States court is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of the substantial decisions of the trust. Additionally, "non-United States person" means a person who is not a United States person, and "United States" means the United States of America, including the States and the District of Columbia, its territories, its possessions and other areas within its jurisdiction. Except as provided below, the Notes may not be redeemed prior to maturity. (1) The Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes if: (a) the Company becomes or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as described above; (b) the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises as a result of any change in the laws, regulations or rulings of the United States, or an official position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change is announced or becomes effective on or after October 21, 2005 and (c) the Company determines, in its business judgment, that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it, other than substituting the obligor under the Notes or taking any action that would entail a material cost to the Company. (2) The Company may also redeem the Notes, at its option, if: (a) any act is taken by a taxing authority of the United States on or after October 21, 2005, whether or not such act is taken in relation to the Company or any affiliate, that results in a substantial probability that the Company will or may be required to pay Additional Amounts as described under above; (b) the Company determines, in its business judgment, that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to it, other than substituting the obligor under the Notes or taking any action that would entail a material cost to the Company and (c) the Company receives an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States results in a substantial probability that the Company will or may be required to pay the Additional Amounts described under above, and delivers to the Trustee a certificate, signed by a duly authorized officer, stating that based on such opinion the Company is entitled to redeem the Notes pursuant to their terms. Any redemption of the Notes as set forth in clauses (1) or (2) above shall be in whole, and not in part, and will be made at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes Outstanding plus accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption. Holders shall be given not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior notice by the Trustee of the date fixed for such redemption.
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. The Notes are governed by the laws of the State of New York.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company (the "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under the Indenture, dated as of March 15, 1987 (as amended and supplemented to date, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of Y50,000,000,000 and increased to Y75,000,000,000. So long as the Notes of this series are in the form of Global Securities only, all Notes of this series will collectively be evidenced (a) by the Global Securities for this series registered in the name of Cede & Co. and bearing registration number R-0001-DTC-A and registration number R-0003-DTC-A (together, the "DTC Global Notes") and (b) by this Global Note and the Global Note for this series bearing registration number R-0002-INT (together, the "International Global Notes"). The DTC Global Notes and the International Global Notes will at all times collectively represent the aggregate principal amount of this series outstanding from time to time. If at any time a portion of an International Global Note is exchanged for an interest in a DTC Global Note, the principal amount of such DTC Global Note shall be increased by the amount of such portion, and such DTC Global Note shall be endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests thereto to reflect such principal increase, subject to the limitation that in no event may the principal amount of either DTC Global Note be greater than the equivalent in U.S. dollars of $500,000,000. If at any time a portion of a DTC Global Note is exchanged for an interest in an International Global Note, the principal amount of such DTC Global Note shall be decreased by the amount of such portion, and such DTC Global Note shall be endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests thereto to reflect such principal decrease. To ascertain the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests attached to a DTC Global Note, inquiry shall be made of the exchange agent under the Fiscal Agency Agreement, and the U.S. dollar equivalent quoted by such exchange agent (and the date of such quote) shall be noted on such Schedule of Exchanges of Interests next to the corresponding Yen amount. If an event of default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to Notes of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Note upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in Sections 11.03 and 11.04 thereof, which provisions apply to this Note. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, without the consent of the holders of Securities, to establish, among other things, the form and terms of any series of Securities issuable thereunder by one or more supplemental indentures,
and, with the consent of the holders of not less than 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of Securities at the time Outstanding which are affected thereby, to modify the Indenture or any supplemental indenture or the rights of the holders of Securitiies of such series to be affected, provided that no such modification will (x) extend the fixed maturity of any Securities, reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, reduce the principal amount thereof or the premium, if any, thereon, reduce the amount of the principal of Original Issue Discount Securities payable on any date, change the currency in which Securities are payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the maturity thereof, without the consent of the holder of each Security so affected, or (y) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities of any series the consent of the holders of which is required for any such modification without the consent of the holders of all Securities of such series then Outstanding, or (z) modify, without the written consent of the Trustee, the rights, duties or immunities of the Trustee. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed. This Note is a Global Security registered in the name of a nominee of the Depository. This Note is exchangeable for Notes registered in the name of a person other than the Depository or its nominee only in the limited circumstances hereinafter described. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for definitive Notes in certificated form, this Note may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository. The Notes represented by this Global Security are exchangeable for definitive Notes in certificated form of like tenor as such Notes in denominations of Y1,000,000 and integral multiples thereof only if (i) the Depository notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for the DTC Global Notes or (ii) the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or (iii) both the Euroclear System and Clearstream Banking, societe anonyme, notify the Company that they are unwilling or unable to continue as a clearing system for the International Global Note or (iv) the Company in its sole discretion decides to allow the Notes to be exchanged for definitive Notes in registered form. Any Notes that are exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence are exchangeable for certificated Notes issuable in authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Depository shall direct. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of definitive Notes in certificated form is registrable in the register maintained by the Company for such purpose, upon surrender of the definitive Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and interest on the definitive Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the registrar duly executed by, the holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. Subject to
the foregoing, this Note is not exchangeable, except for a Global Security or Global Securities of this issue of the same principal amount to be registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

(11) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Note is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any paying agent from a payment of principal or interest on a Note if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other paying agent. (12) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Note is reduced as a result of any combination of items (1) through (11) above. Except as specifically provided herein, the Company will not be required to make any payment of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of such government.

The Issuer shall confirm to the Fiscal Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. (London time) on the second Business Day before the relevant date for such payment that it has issued irrevocable payment instructions for such payment to be made. 4.2 If for any reason the Fiscal Agent does not receive unconditionally the full amount payable by the Issuer on the relevant due date in respect of all the outstanding or maturing Notes, the Fiscal Agent
4 shall forthwith notify immediately the Issuer by telephone followed by facsimile and the Fiscal Agent shall not be bound to make any payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes until the Fiscal Agent has received to its order the full amount of the monies then due and payable in respect of all outstanding or maturing Notes, provided, however, that if the Fiscal Agent shall, in its discretion, make any payment of principal or interest on or after the due date therefor in respect of the Notes prior to its unconditional receipt of the full amount then due and payable in respect of all outstanding Notes, the Issuer will promptly pay such amount to the Fiscal Agent and will compensate the Fiscal Agent at a rate equal to the Fiscal Agent's cost of funding. 4.3 Out of the sums paid to the Fiscal Agent in respect of interest and principal on the Notes, the Fiscal Agent will make payment free of charge to the registered holder of the International Global Note and the DTC Global Note as stipulated in Clause 9 below, in the amounts specified in the Conditions.

5 7. DUTIES OF THE REGISTRAR 7.1 The Registrar shall maintain the Register in London in accordance with the Conditions. The Register shall show the aggregate amount of Notes represented by each Global Note at the date of issue and all subsequent transfers and exchanges involving a change in such amounts and the names and addresses of the registered holders (each a "PAYEE"). On the first Business Day after the Record Date for any interest payment on the Notes, the Registrar shall send payment details in respect of the Payees and the Yen accounts to which transfers should be made to the Fiscal Agent. 7.2 Transfers or exchanges of Notes will be made in accordance with the Conditions, the procedures established for this purpose between Euroclear, Clearstream, DTC and the Registrar, and Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC's regulations applicable to such transfers or exchanges. Any such transfer or exchange which results in a change in the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC shall be notified by Euroclear, Clearstream and DTC to the Registrar. The Registrar shall promptly enter details of the transfer or exchange in the Register, which entry shall, without further action, cause the aggregate principal amount represented by each Global Note to be amended accordingly. 7.3 The Registrar shall at all reasonable times during office hours make the Register available to the Issuer and the Fiscal Agent or any person authorised by either of them for inspection and for the taking of copies thereof or extracts therefrom, and the Registrar shall deliver to such persons such information contained in the Register or relating to the Notes as they may reasonably request. 8.

PAYMENTS TO DTC NOTEHOLDERS 9.1 All amounts of principal and interest due in respect of the Notes which are represented by the DTC Global Note (each a "DTC AMOUNT") shall be paid in U.S. dollars (each such payment being referred to herein as a "U.S. DOLLAR PAYMENT"), unless DTC has advised the Fiscal Agent that the relevant Noteholder has made an effective election to receive all or a portion of its payment in Yen outside DTC (each a "YEN PAYMENT"). 9.2 The Paying Agent shall, from each DTC Amount received by it, make U.S. Dollar Payments in accordance with the Conditions and Yen Payments in accordance with the Conditions. 10. DUTIES OF EXCHANGE AGENT For the purposes of this Clause 10, a "payment date" shall be each date on which the Issuer is obligated to remit funds to the Fiscal Agent pursuant to Clause 4.1. The Exchange Agent shall: (i) accept Yen by remittance to an account maintained by the Exchange Agent of the total amount of interest or principal due on any payment date on Notes held by Cede & Co. (as nominee of DTC) on the Record Date. The Exchange Agent shall be advised by Cede & Co. (as nominee of DTC) if any beneficial holders of the Notes held by Cede & Co. (as nominee of DTC) have elected to receive payment in Yen and, if so, the amount of Notes held by such holders and the accounts to which such payments in Yen are to be wired. On the payment date, the Exchange Agent shall wire payment in the appropriate Yen amounts to the accounts indicated. The remainder on such payment date shall be exchanged by the Exchange Agent pursuant to sub-clause (ii) below into U.S. dollars and, after deduction of any costs relating to such exchange, shall be paid to Cede & Co. (as nominee of DTC) on the payment date; and
6 (ii) at or prior to 11:00 a.m., London time, on the second London business day preceding the applicable payment date, enter into a contract for the purchase of U.S. dollars with the Specified Amount of Yen for settlement on such payment date. "SPECIFIED AMOUNT" shall mean the aggregate amount of Yen payable to all Noteholders holding Notes through participants of DTC that have not elected to receive payments in Yen. The amount of U.S. dollars payable in respect of a particular payment under the DTC Global Note will be equal to the amount of Yen otherwise payable exchanged into U.S. dollars at the Yen/U.S.$ exchange rate prevailing as at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the second London business day prior to the relevant payment date, less any costs incurred by the Exchange Agent for such conversion (such costs to be shared pro rata among holders under the DTC Global Note accepting U.S. dollar payments in proportion of their respective holdings). If an exchange rate bid quotation is not so available, the Exchange Agent shall obtain a bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank in London selected by the Exchange Agent after consultation with the Issuer. If no bid quotation is so available, payment will be made in Yen to the account or accounts specified by DTC to the Exchange Agent. In this sub-clause (ii), the term "London business day" shall mean any day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments in New York City, Tokyo and London. 11.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances will any Agent be liable to the Issuer or any other person for any consequential loss (being loss of business, goodwill, opportunity or profit) even if advised to the possibility of such loss or damages. 11.4 The indemnities above shall survive the termination or expiry of this Agreement. 11.5 Each of the Agents shall be protected and shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, omitted or suffered in reliance upon any instruction or communication from the Issuer or any document reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been delivered, signed or sent by the proper party or parties in accordance with the provisions hereof, except such as may result from its own negligence or wilful misconduct or that of its officers, employees or agents. 11.6 In acting hereunder and in connection with the Notes, the Agents do not assume any relationship of agency and trust for the Noteholders, and shall not have any obligation towards them except that all funds held by the Fiscal Agent for payment of principal of or interest on the Notes shall be held exclusively for the benefit of and for payment to the Noteholders and shall be applied as set forth herein and in the Conditions.

Any change in any Agent shall be notified by the Issuer to the other Agent(s). 12.2 The Issuer agrees with the Fiscal Agent that if, by the day falling 10 days before the expiry of any notice under Clause 12.1 above, the Issuer has not appointed a replacement Fiscal Agent, then the Fiscal Agent shall be entitled, on behalf of the Issuer, to appoint in its place any reputable financial institution of good standing and the Issuer shall not unreasonably object to such appointment. 12.3 Upon the effectiveness of the appointment of any successor Fiscal Agent, Registrar, Exchange Agent, Paying Agent and Transfer Agent, as the case may be, pursuant to Clause 12.1, the Fiscal Agent, Registrar, Exchange Agent, Paying Agent and Transfer Agent so removed shall cease to be a Fiscal Agent, Registrar, Exchange Agent, Paying Agent and Transfer Agent, as the case may be, hereunder.
