Market Disruption Event
A "" means a day, as determined by the calculation agent, on which trading is generally conducted (or was scheduled to have been generally conducted, but for the occurrence of a Market Disruption Event) on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq National Market, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and in the over-the-counter market for equity securities in the United States, or (in the case of a security traded on one or more non-U.S. securities exchanges or markets) on the principal non-U.S. securities exchange or market for such security.
Trading Day
The "" of Cemex ADRs (or any other security for which a Trading Price must be determined) on any date of determination will be (1) if the ADRs are listed on a national securities exchange on that date of determination, any reported sale price, regular way, of the principal trading session on that date on the principal U.S. exchange on which the ADRs are listed or admitted to trading, (2) if the ADRs are not listed on a national securities exchange on that date of determination, or if the reported sale price on such exchange is not obtainable (even if the ADRs are listed or admitted to trading on such exchange), and the ADRs are quoted on the Nasdaq National Market, any reported sale price of the principal trading session on that date as reported on the Nasdaq, and (3) if the ADRs are not quoted on the Nasdaq on that date of determination, or if the reported sale price on the Nasdaq is not obtainable (even if the ADRs are quoted on the Nasdaq), any reported sale price of the principal trading session on the over-the-counter market on that date as reported on the OTC Bulletin Board, the National Quotation Bureau or a similar organization, provided that, if the trading price of Cemex ADRs cannot be determined by the methods described in (1), (2) or (3) above, then the Trading Price will be any reported sale price of the principal trading session of Cemex CPOs on that date on the Mexican Stock Exchange in Mexico, expressed in U.S. dollars as converted from the relevant currency using the 12:00 noon buying rate in New York certified by the New York Federal Reserve Bank for customs purposes on that date, or if this rate is unavailable, such rate as the calculation agent may determine, provided, however, that the Trading Price will be determined as described in this paragraph and with regard to the number of Cemex CPOs represented by each Cemex ADR at the time the determination of the Trading Price is made, provided further that, if the Trading Price of any other security for which a Trading Price must be determined cannot be determined by the methods described in (1), (2) or (3) above and if the security for which a trading price
Trading Price
 
must be determined is traded on one or more non-U.S. securities exchanges or markets, then the Trading Price of such security will be any reported sale price of the principal trading session on that date on the principal non-U.S. securities exchange or market on which the security is traded, expressed in U.S. dollars as converted from the relevant currency using the 12:00 noon buying rate in New York certified by the New York Federal Reserve Bank for customs purposes on that date, or if this rate is unavailable, such rate as the calculation agent may determine. The determination of the Trading Price by the calculation agent in the event of a Market Disruption Event may be deferred by the calculation agent for up to five consecutive Trading Days on which a Market Disruption Event is occurring, but not past the third Trading Day prior to the Stated Maturity Date. If no reported sale price of the principal trading session is available pursuant to clauses (1), (2) or (3) above or the provisos above or if there is a Market Disruption Event, the Trading Price on any date of determination, unless deferred by the calculation agent as described in the preceding sentence, will be the arithmetic mean, as determined by the calculation agent, of the bid prices of the ADRs obtained from as many dealers in such ADRs (which may include Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or any of the Company's other affiliates or subsidiaries), but not exceeding three such dealers, as will make such bid prices available to the calculation agent. A security "" will include a security included for listing or quotation in any successor to such system and the term "" will include any successor to such service. If the Cemex ADR program is terminated, the Trading Price will be calculated by substituting Cemex CPOs for the ADRs and using the determination method described in the proviso above. Upon the occurrence of certain events described under "Dilution Adjustments" below, the Trading Price will be calculated by substituting the relevant security for the ADRs. In the event that the Cemex ADR program is terminated or the Trading Price is otherwise calculated by substituting Cemex COPs for the ADRs, if the Trading Price of Cemex ADRs at any time after March 27, 2006 up to and including the third Trading Day before the Stated Maturity Date is less than or equal to the Downside Trigger Price, at the Stated Maturity Date, you will receive an amount in cash equal to the Trading Price of Cemex ADRs on the third Trading Day before the Stated Maturity Date, determined as described in this paragraph, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.

OTC Bulletin Board
DILUTION ADJUSTMENTS
If Cemex, after March 27, 2006,
(1) pays a share dividend or makes a distribution with respect to its CPOs in such CPOs,
(2) subdivides or splits the outstanding CPOs into a greater number of CPOs,
(3) combines the outstanding CPOs into a smaller number of CPOs, or
(4) issues by reclassification of its CPOs any other CPOs of Cemex,
then, in each of these cases, the Exchange Ratio will be multiplied by a dilution adjustment equal to a fraction, the numerator of which will be the number of CPOs outstanding immediately after the event, plus, in the case of a reclassification referred to in (4) above, the number of other CPOs of Cemex, and the denominator of which will be the number of CPOs outstanding
 
immediately before the event. In the event of a reclassification referred to in (4) above as a result of which no CPO is outstanding, the Exchange Ratio will be determined by reference to the other CPOs of Cemex issued in the reclassification. The Initial ADR Price and the Downside Trigger Price will also be adjusted in that case in the manner described below.
If Cemex, after March 27, 2006, issues, or declares a record date in respect of an issuance of, rights or warrants to all holders of its CPOs entitling them to subscribe for or purchase its CPOs at a price per CPO less than the Then-Current Market Price of the Cemex CPOs, other than rights to purchase Cemex CPOs pursuant to a plan for the reinvestment of dividends or interest, then, in each case, the Exchange Ratio will be multiplied by a dilution adjustment equal to a fraction, the numerator of which will be the number of Cemex CPOs outstanding immediately before the adjustment is effected by reason of the issuance of such rights or warrants, plus the number of additional Cemex CPOs offered for subscription or purchase pursuant to the rights or warrants, and the denominator of which will be the number of Cemex CPOs outstanding immediately before the adjustment is effected by reason of the issuance of the rights or warrants, plus the number of additional Cemex CPOs which the aggregate offering price of the total number of Cemex CPOs offered for subscription or purchase pursuant to the rights or warrants would purchase at the Then-Current Market Price of the Cemex CPOs, which will be determined by multiplying the total number of Cemex CPOs so offered for subscription or purchase by the exercise price of the rights or warrants and dividing the product obtained by the Then-Current Market Price. To the extent that, after the expiration of the rights or warrants, the Cemex CPOs offered thereby have not been delivered, the Exchange Ratio will be further adjusted to equal the Exchange Ratio which would have been in effect had the adjustment for the issuance of the rights or warrants been made upon the basis of delivery of only the number of Cemex CPOs actually delivered. The Initial ADR Price and the Downside Trigger Price will also be adjusted in that case in the manner described below.
If Cemex, after March 27, 2006, declares or pays a dividend or makes a distribution to all holders of the Cemex CPOs of any class of its capital shares, the capital shares of one or more of its subsidiaries, evidences of its indebtedness or other non-cash assets, excluding any dividends or distributions referred to in the above paragraph and excluding any issuance or distribution to all holders of its CPOs, in the form of Marketable Securities, of capital shares of one or more of its subsidiaries, or issues to all holders of its CPOs rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any of its or one or more of its subsidiaries' securities, other than rights or warrants referred to in the above paragraph, then, in each of these cases, the Exchange Ratio will be multiplied by a dilution adjustment equal to a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Then-Current Market Price of one CPO, and the denominator of which will be the Then-Current Market Price of one CPO, less the fair market value as of the time the adjustment is effected of the portion of the capital shares, assets, evidences of indebtedness, rights or warrants so distributed or issued applicable to one CPO. The Initial ADR Price and the Downside Trigger Price will also be adjusted in that case in the manner described below. If any capital shares declared or paid as a dividend or otherwise distributed or issued to all holders of Cemex CPOs consists, in whole or in part, of Marketable Securities, then the fair market value of such Marketable Securities will be determined by the calculation agent by reference to the Trading Price of such capital shares. The fair market value of any other distribution or issuance referred to in this paragraph will be
 
determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company, whose determination will be final.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, with respect to any dividend or distribution to which the above paragraph would otherwise apply, the denominator in the fraction referred to in the above formula is less than $1.00 or is a negative number, then the Company may, at its option, elect to have the adjustment provided by the above paragraph not be made and in lieu of this adjustment, the Trading Price of Cemex ADRs on any Trading Day thereafter up to and including the third Trading Day before the Stated Maturity Date will be deemed to be equal to the fair market value of the capital shares, evidences of indebtedness, assets, rights or warrants (determined, as of the date this dividend or distribution is made, by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company, whose determination will be final) so distributed or issued applicable to one Cemex ADR and, if the Trading Price of Cemex ADRs on any Trading Day thereafter, up to and including the third Trading Day before the Stated Maturity Date, is less than or equal to the Downside Trigger Price, each holder of the ELKS will have the right to receive at the Stated Maturity Date cash in an amount per ELKS equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by such fair market value.
If Cemex, after March 27, 2006, declares a record date in respect of a distribution of cash, other than any Permitted Dividends described below, any cash distributed in consideration of fractional Cemex CPOs and any cash distributed in a Reorganization Event referred to below, by dividend or otherwise, to all holders of its CPOs, or makes an Excess Purchase Payment, then the Exchange Ratio will be multiplied by a dilution adjustment equal to a fraction, the numerator of which will be the Then-Current Market Price of the Cemex CPOs, and the denominator of which will be the Then-Current Market Price of the Cemex CPOs on the record date less the amount of the distribution applicable to one CPO which would not be a Permitted Dividend, or, in the case of an Excess Purchase Payment, less the aggregate amount of the Excess Purchase Payment for which adjustment is being made at the time divided by the number of Cemex CPOs outstanding on the record date. The Initial ADR Price and the Downside Trigger Price will also be adjusted in that case in the manner described below.
For the purposes of these adjustments:
A "" is any cash dividend in respect of Cemex CPOs, other than a cash dividend that exceeds the immediately preceding cash dividend, and then only to the extent that the per CPO amount of this dividend results in an annualized dividend yield on the Cemex CPOs in excess of 10%.
Permitted Dividend
An "" is the excess, if any, of (x) the cash and the value (as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company, whose determination will be final) of all other consideration paid by Cemex with respect to one CPO acquired in a tender offer or exchange offer by Cemex, over (y) the Then-Current Market Price of the CPO.
Excess Purchase Payment
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, with respect to any dividend, distribution or Excess Purchase Payment to which the sixth paragraph in this section would
 
otherwise apply, the denominator in the fraction referred to in the formula in that paragraph is less than $1.00 or is a negative number, then the Company may, at its option, elect to have the adjustment provided by the sixth paragraph in this section not be made and in lieu of this adjustment, the Trading Price of Cemex ADRs on any Trading Day thereafter up to and including the third Trading Day before the Stated Maturity Date will be deemed to be equal to the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of other consideration (determined, as of the date this dividend or distribution is made, by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company, whose determination will be final) so distributed or applied to the acquisition of the Cemex CPOs in the tender offer or exchange offer applicable to one Cemex ADR and, if the Trading Price of Cemex ADRs on any Trading Day thereafter, up to and including the third Trading Day before the Stated Maturity Date, is less than or equal to the Downside Trigger Price, each holder of the ELKS will have the right to receive at the Stated Maturity Date cash in an amount per ELKS equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by such sum.
If any adjustment is made to the Exchange Ratio as set forth above, an adjustment will also be made to the Initial ADR Price and the Downside Trigger Price. The required adjustment will be made by dividing the Initial ADR Price and the Downside Trigger Price by the relevant dilution adjustment.
If Cemex, after March 27, 2006, issues or makes a distribution to all holders of its Cemex CPOs of the capital shares of one or more of its subsidiaries, in each case in the form of Marketable Securities, and if the Trading Price of Cemex ADRs on any Trading Day after March 27, 2006 up to and including the third Trading Day before the Stated Maturity Date (whether intra-day or at the close of trading on any day) is less than or equal to the Downside Trigger Price, then, in each of these cases, each holder of the ELKS will receive at the Stated Maturity Date for each ELKS a combination of Cemex ADRs equal to the Exchange Ratio and a number of shares of such Cemex subsidiaries' capital shares equal to the Exchange Ratio times (x) the number of Cemex CPOs represented by each Cemex ADR and (y) the number of shares of such subsidiaries' capital shares distributed per Cemex CPO. Following the record date for an event described in this paragraph, the Trading Price of Cemex ADRs will equal the Trading Price of Cemex ADRs, plus the Trading Price of such subsidiaries' capital shares times (x) the number of Cemex CPOs represented by each Cemex ADR and (y) the number of shares of such subsidiaries' capital shares distributed per Cemex CPO. In the event a distribution pursuant to this paragraph occurs, following the record date for such distribution, the adjustments described in "Dilution Adjustments" will also apply to such subsidiaries' capital shares if any of the events described in "Dilution Adjustments" occurs with respect to such capital shares.
Each dilution adjustment will be effected as follows:
 
 
 
 
All dilution adjustments will be rounded upward or downward to the nearest 1/10,000th or, if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th, to the next lower 1/10,000th. No adjustment in the Exchange Ratio will be required unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent therein, provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this sentence are not required to be made will be carried forward (on a percentage basis) and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. If any announcement or declaration of a record date in respect of a dividend, distribution, issuance or repurchase requiring an adjustment as described herein is subsequently canceled by Cemex, or this dividend, distribution, issuance or repurchase fails to receive requisite approvals or fails to occur for any other reason, then, upon the cancellation, failure of approval or failure to occur, the Exchange Ratio, the Initial ADR Price and the Downside Trigger Price will be further adjusted to the Exchange Ratio, the Initial ADR Price and the Downside Trigger Price which would then have been in effect had adjustment for the event not been made. If a Reorganization Event described below occurs after the occurrence of one or more events requiring an adjustment as described herein, the dilution adjustments previously applied to the Exchange Ratio will not be rescinded but will be applied to the Reorganization Event as provided for below.
The "" of the Cemex CPOs, for the purpose of applying any dilution adjustment, means the average Closing Price per CPO for the ten Trading Days immediately before this adjustment is effected or, in the case of an adjustment effected at the opening of business on the Business Day next following a record date, immediately before the earlier of the date the adjustment is effected and the related Ex-Date. For purposes of determining the Then-Current Market Price, the determination of the Closing Price by the calculation agent in the event of a Market Disruption Event, as described in the definition of Closing Price, may be deferred by the calculation agent for up to five consecutive Trading Days on which a Market Disruption Event is occurring, but not past the third Trading Day prior to the Stated Maturity Date.
Then-Current Market Price
The "" of Cemex CPOs (or any other security for which a Closing Price must be determined) on any date of determination will be (1) if the Cemex CPOs are listed on a national securities exchange on that date of determination, the closing sale price or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price on that date on the principal U.S. exchange on which the Cemex CPOs are listed or admitted to trading, (2) if the Cemex CPOs are not listed on a national securities exchange on that date of determination, or if the closing sale price or last reported sale price is not obtainable (even if the Cemex CPOs are listed or admitted to trading on
Closing Price
 
such exchange), and the Cemex CPOs are quoted on the Nasdaq National Market, the closing sale price or, if no closing sale price is reported, the last reported sale price on that date as reported on the Nasdaq, and (3) if the Cemex CPOs are not quoted on the Nasdaq on that date of determination, or if the closing sale price or last reported sale price is not obtainable (even if the Cemex CPOs are quoted on the Nasdaq), the last quoted bid price for the Cemex CPOs in the over-the-counter market on that date as reported on the OTC Bulletin Board, the National Quotation Bureau or a similar organization, provided that, if the Closing Price of Cemex CPOs cannot be determined by the methods described in (1), (2) or (3) above, then the Closing Price will be the closing sale price or last reported sale price, as the case may be, reported on that date on the Mexican Stock Exchange in Mexico expressed in U.S. dollars as converted from the relevant currency using the 12:00 noon buying rate in New York certified by the New York Federal Reserve Bank for customs purposes on that date, or if this rate is unavailable, such rate as the calculation agent may determine, provided, however, that the Closing Price will be determined as described in this paragraph, provided further that, if the Closing Price of any other security for which a Closing Price must be determined cannot be determined by the methods described in (1), (2) or (3) above and if the security for which a Closing Price must be determined is traded on one or more non-U.S. securities exchanges or markets, then the Closing Price of such security will be the closing sale price, last reported sale price or last quoted bid price, as the case may be, reported on that date on the principal non-U.S. securities exchange or market on which the security is traded, expressed in U.S. dollars as converted from the relevant currency using the 12:00 noon buying rate in New York certified by the New York Federal Reserve Bank for customs purposes on that date, or if this rate is unavailable, such rate as the calculation agent may determine. The determination of the Closing Price by the calculation agent in the event of a Market Disruption Event may be deferred by the calculation agent for up to five consecutive Trading Days on which a Market Disruption Event is occurring, but not past the third Trading Day prior to the Stated Maturity Date. If no closing sale price or last reported sale price is available pursuant to clauses (1), (2) or (3) above or the provisos above or if there is a Market Disruption Event, the Closing Price on any date of determination, unless deferred by the calculation agent as described in the preceding sentence, will be the arithmetic mean, as determined by the calculation agent, of the bid prices of the Cemex CPOs obtained from as many dealers in such Cemex CPOs (which may include Citigroup Global Markets Inc. or any of the Company's other affiliates or subsidiaries), but not exceeding three such dealers, as will make such bid prices available to the calculation agent. A security "" will include a security included for listing or quotation in any successor to such system and the term "" will include any successor to such service. If, during any period of ten Trading Days used to calculate the Then-Current Market Price, there occurs any event requiring an adjustment to be effected as described herein, then the Closing Price for each Trading Day in such period of ten Trading Days occurring prior to the day on which such adjustment is effected will be adjusted by being divided by the relevant dilution adjustment.
quoted on the Nasdaq National Market
OTC Bulletin Board
The "" relating to any dividend, distribution or issuance is the first date on which the Cemex CPOs trade in the regular way on their principal market without the right to receive this dividend, distribution or issuance.
Ex-Date
 
In the event of any of the following ":"
Reorganization Events
 
 
 
 
the Trading Price of Cemex ADRs on any Trading Day thereafter up to and including the third Trading Day before the Stated Maturity Date will be deemed to be equal to the Transaction Value.
The "" will equal the number of Cemex CPOs represented by each Cemex ADR times the sum of:
Transaction Value
(1) for any cash received in a Reorganization Event, the amount of cash received per CPO,
(2) for any property other than cash or Marketable Securities received in a Reorganization Event, an amount equal to the fair market value on the date the Reorganization Event is consummated of that property received per CPO, as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company, whose determination will be final, and
(3) for any Marketable Securities received in a Reorganization Event, an amount equal to the Closing Price per CPO of these Marketable Securities on the applicable Trading Day multiplied by the number of these Marketable Securities received for each CPO.
"" are any perpetual equity securities or debt securities with a stated maturity after the Stated Maturity Date, in each case that are listed on a U.S. national securities exchange or reported by the Nasdaq National Market. The number of shares of any equity securities constituting Marketable Securities included in the calculation of Transaction Value pursuant to clause (3) above will be adjusted if any event occurs with respect to the Marketable Securities or the issuer of the Marketable Securities between the time of the Reorganization Event and the Stated Maturity Date that would have required an adjustment as described above, had it occurred with respect to Cemex CPOs or Cemex. Adjustment for these subsequent events will be as nearly equivalent as practicable to the adjustments described above.
Marketable Securities
If Cemex CPOs have been subject to a Reorganization Event and the Trading Price of Cemex ADRs on any Trading Day thereafter, up to and including the third Trading Day before
 
the Stated Maturity Date, is less than or equal to the Downside Trigger Price, then each holder of the ELKS will have the right to receive per $10 principal amount of ELKS (i) cash in an amount equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the sum of clauses (1) and (2) in the definition of "Transaction Value" above and (ii) the number of Marketable Securities received for each CPO in the Reorganization Event multiplied by (x) the number of Cemex CPOs represented by each Cemex ADR and (y) the Exchange Ratio.
The adjustments described herein assume that each Cemex ADR will continue to represent, directly or indirectly, ten Cemex CPOs. If the number of Cemex CPOs represented by an ADR changes, whether in conjunction with one of the foregoing adjustment events or otherwise, then all dilution adjustments relating to the Exchange Ratio, the Initial ADR Price and the Downside Trigger Price will reflect the new ratio of Cemex CPOs to ADRs. If any of the events described above occurs with respect to Cemex ADRs and not with respect to or with proportional effect on Cemex CPOs, then the calculation agent will effect the applicable dilution adjustments based on the Trading Price and the outstanding number of Cemex ADRs.
The adjustments described herein also assume that the proportion of Cemex Series A common shares and Cemex Series B common shares represented by CPOs to such shares held directly not in the form of CPOs will remain the same during the term of the ELKS. If the proportion of Cemex Series A common shares and Cemex Series B common shares represented by CPOs to such shares held directly not in the form of CPOs changes, or if other changes are made with respect to the shares underlying the CPOs, in each case whether in conjunction with one of the foregoing events, as applicable to such shares or the CPOs, or otherwise, then the calculation agent will effect adjustments relating to the Exchange Ratio, the Initial ADR Price and the Downside Trigger Price to take into account such changes.
For the purpose of adjustments described herein, each non-U.S. dollar value (whether a value of cash, property, securities or otherwise) shall be expressed in U.S. dollars as converted from the relevant currency using the 12:00 noon buying rate in New York certified by the new York Federal Reserve Bank for customs purposes on the date of valuation, or if this rate is unavailable, such rate as the calculation agent may determine.
Citigroup Funding will be responsible for the calculation and effectuation of any adjustment described herein and will furnish the indenture trustee with notice of any such adjustment.

In such case, the amount declared due and payable upon any acceleration permitted by the Indenture will be determined by the calculation agent and will be equal to, with respect to this Note, the Maturity Payment calculated as though the Stated Maturity Date of this Note were the date of early repayment. In case of default at the Stated Maturity Date of this Note, this Note shall bear interest, payable upon demand of the beneficial owners of this Note in accordance with the terms of the ELKS, from and after the Stated Maturity Date through the date when payment of such amount has been made or duly provided for, at the rate of 5.375% per annum on the unpaid amount (or the cash equivalent of such unpaid amount) due.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company, the Guarantor and the rights of the holders of the Debt Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company, the Guarantor and a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time Outstanding of each series affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Debt Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company and the Guarantor with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
The holder of this Note may not enforce such holder's rights pursuant to the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.

All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture but not in this Note shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purposes.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
