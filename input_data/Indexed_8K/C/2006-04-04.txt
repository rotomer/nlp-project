EXHIBIT 99.1 FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK 33 LIBERTY STREET NEW YORK, N.Y. 10045-0001 TELEPHONE 212 720-5268 William L. Rutledge April 3, 2006 Executive Vice President Mr. Charles Prince Chief Executive Officer Citigroup Inc. 399 Park Avenue 2nd Floor New York, NY 10021 Dear Mr. Prince: I write concerning the Order issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Board") on March 16, 2005, slightly more than one year ago (the "Order"). The Board's Order approved Citigroup's application for the Board of Governors' approval under Section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act to acquire First American Bank. In the text of the Order, the Board recited its expectation that Citigroup would "devote the necessary attention to implementing its [compliance risk management program] fully and effectively" and "not undertake significant expansion during the implementation period." Citigroup has made significant progress in implementing its new compliance risk management program. Consequently, the understanding that you would refrain from significant expansion is no longer in operation. Of course, the System will carefully review any expansion proposal undertaken by Citigroup in accordance with all applicable statutory requirements and cannot, at this time, express any view on whether those requirements would be met regarding any specific proposal. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call. Very truly yours, /s/ William L. Rutledge William L. Rutledge
