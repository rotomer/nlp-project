Retail Medium-Term Notes, Series F GLOBAL SELLING AGENCY AGREEMENT April 13, 2006 New York, New York To the Agents listed on Schedule I hereto Ladies and Gentlemen: Citigroup Funding Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and Citigroup Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"), confirm their agreement with each of you with respect to the issue and sale by the Company of its Retail Medium-Term Notes, Series F in registered form (the "Notes"), which Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the "Guarantee") by the Guarantor. The Notes will be issued under an indenture (the "Senior Debt Indenture") dated as of June 1, 2005, among the Company, the Guarantor, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"). Unless otherwise specifically provided for and set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement (as defined below), the Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $1,000 and in denominations exceeding such amount by integral multiples of $1,000 and will be issued only in fully registered form, and the Notes will have the interest rates, maturities, redemption provisions and other terms set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement. The Notes will be issued, and the terms thereof established, in accordance with the Senior Debt Indenture and the Retail Medium-Term Notes, Series F Administrative Procedures attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Administrative Procedures") (unless a Terms Agreement (as defined in Section 2(b)) modifies or otherwise supersedes such Administrative Procedures with respect to the Notes issued pursuant to such Terms Agreement). The Administrative Procedures may only be amended by written agreement of the Company, the Guarantor and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as purchasing agent (the "Purchasing Agent"), on behalf of the Agents, after notice to, and with the approval of, the Trustee. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Agent" shall refer to any one of you and to any additional agents appointed as a party to this Agreement pursuant to Section 2(d) hereof; and the term "you" shall refer to you and any other Agent collectively. In acting under this Agreement, each of you is acting individually and not jointly. Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or any Pricing Supplement (each, as defined below) shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") on or before the most recent date and time that the Registration Statement, any post-effective amendment or amendments thereto became or become effective (the "Effective Date") or the issue date of the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or any Pricing Supplement, as the case may be; and
any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or any Pricing Supplement shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement or any Pricing Supplement, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference. 1. Representations and Warranties. The Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally represent and warrant to, and agree with, each of you as set forth below in this Section 1. (a) The Company and the Guarantor meet the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and have prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement, as defined in Rule 405, (File No. 333-132370), including a related base prospectus dated March 10, 2006 (the "Base Prospectus") and a form of prospectus supplement relating to the Notes, for registration under the Securities Act of the offering and sale of the Notes. Such automatic shelf registration statement, including exhibits and financial statements but excluding all Forms T-1, and any prospectus supplement or pricing supplement relating to the Notes that is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) and deemed part of such automatic shelf registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B, as amended on each Effective Date is referred to herein as the "Registration Statement". Such Registration Statement, including any amendments thereto filed prior to the date of this Agreement, became effective upon filing. The Company and the Guarantor will file with the Commission a final prospectus supplement relating to the Notes in accordance with Rule 424(b) (the "Prospectus Supplement", which together with the Base Prospectus is referred to herein as the "Prospectus"). As filed, such Prospectus Supplement shall contain all information required by the Act and the rules thereunder, and, except to the extent the Agents shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to you prior to the date of this Agreement, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Base Prospectus) as the Company and has advised you, prior to the date of this Agreement, will be included therein; provided that the terms of a particular offering of the Notes will be set forth in a supplement to the Prospectus Supplement (a "Pricing Supplement") which the Company and the Guarantor will file with the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b). The Registration Statement, as of the date of this Agreement, meets the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x). The initial Effective Date of the Registration Statement was not earlier than the date three years before the date of this Agreement; (b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder, and any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, or any further amendment or supplement thereto, when such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; 2
(c) On each Effective Date, the Registration Statement did, and when the Prospectus Supplement is first filed in accordance with Rule 424(b) and on the Commencement Date (as defined in Section 2(b) below) and on the date of delivery of and payment for a particular issue of Notes as specified in the related Terms Agreement (as defined in Section 2(b) below) (the "Settlement Date"), the Prospectus Supplement (and any supplement thereto) will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust Indenture Act") and the respective rules thereunder; on each Effective Date and at the time sales of a particular offering of the Notes are confirmed (the "Time of Sale"), the Registration Statement did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; and on the Effective Date, on the Commencement Date and on the Settlement Date the Indenture did or will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Trust Indenture Act and the rules thereunder; on the date of any filing pursuant to Rule 424(b), on the Commencement Date and on the Settlement Date, the Prospectus (and any supplement thereto)will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Company and the Guarantor make no representations or warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (ii) the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus Supplement or applicable Pricing Supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Agent through the Purchasing Agent specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or Prospectus (and any supplement thereto): (d) As of the Time of Sale, the Disclosure Package (as defined below), when taken together with the specific pricing terms of the Notes set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Agent through the Purchasing Agent specifically for use therein. The "Disclosure Package" means (i) the Base Prospectus, as amended and supplemented most recently prior to the Time of Sale, (ii) the Prospectus Supplement, (iii) the related preliminary Pricing Supplement, if any, used most recently prior to the Time of Sale and (iv) any applicable issuer free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 433 under the Act (each an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus"), filed with the Commission under Rule 433 prior to the Time of Sale; (e) (i) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), (iii) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c)) made any offer relating to the Notes in reliance on the exemption in Rule 163 and (iv) at the Time of Sale (with such time being used as the determination date for 3
purposes of this clause (iv)), each of the Company and the Guarantor was or is (as the case may be) a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405. The Company agrees to pay the fees required by the Commission relating to the Notes within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r); (f) (i) At the earliest time after the filing of the Registration Statement that the Company or another offering participant made a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2)) of the Notes and (ii) as of the Time of Sale (with such time being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (ii)), neither the Company nor the Guarantor was and is an Ineligible Issuer (as defined in Rule 405), without taking account of any determination by the Commission pursuant to Rule 405 that it is not necessary that the Company or the Guarantor be considered an Ineligible Issuer; (g) Each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus does not include any information that conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated therein and any prospectus supplement or pricing supplement deemed to be a part thereof that has not been superseded or modified. The foregoing two sentences do not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Agent through the Purchasing Agent specifically for use therein; (h) The Notes have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the Senior Debt Indenture and delivered to and duly paid for by the purchasers thereof, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms and entitled to the benefits of the Senior Debt Indenture (subject, as to enforcement, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); the Senior Debt Indenture has been duly authorized by the Company and qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; and the Senior Debt Indenture conforms to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented to relate to such issuance of Notes; (i) The Guarantees have been duly authorized and, when the Notes have been executed, authenticated and delivered in accordance with the Senior Debt Indenture, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Senior Debt Indenture; and (j) Since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, each as amended or supplemented, there has not been any material adverse change in the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which is not disclosed in the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, each as amended or supplemented. 2. Appointment of Agents. Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, the Company hereby (i) appoints and authorizes the Agents to act as its agents to solicit offers for the purchase of all or part of the Notes from the Company in accordance with the terms hereof 4
and (ii) agrees that whenever the Company determines from time to time to sell Notes pursuant to this Agreement, it will enter into a Terms Agreement (as defined below) relating to such sale in accordance with the provisions of Section 2(b) hereof between the Company and the Purchasing Agent, with the Purchasing Agent purchasing such Notes as principal for resale to other Agents or other dealers (the "Selected Dealers"), each of whom will purchase as principal. (a) Solicitations of Offers to Purchase Notes. Following the Commencement Date (defined below), the Company shall notify the Purchasing Agent from time to time as to the commencement of a period during which the Notes may be offered and sold by the Agents (each period, commencing with such a notification and ending at such time as the authorization for offers and sales through the Agents shall have been suspended by the Company or the Agents as provided hereunder, being herein referred to as an "Offering Period"). The initial Offering Period shall begin on April 13, 2006 (the "Commencement Date"). On the basis of the representations and warranties, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each of the Agents agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit offers to purchase Notes from the Company upon the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Prospectus (and any supplement thereto) and in the Administrative Procedures. The Purchasing Agent shall communicate to the Company, orally or in writing, each reasonable offer or indication of interest to purchase Notes received by each Agent. The Company shall have the sole right to accept offers to purchase the Notes and may reject any such offer in whole or in part. Each Agent shall have the right to reject, in its discretion reasonably exercised, any offer received by it to purchase the Notes, in whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of its agreements contained herein. In soliciting offers to purchase the Notes, no Agent assumes any obligation toward or relationship of agency or trust with any purchaser of the Notes (other than any such obligation or relationship which the Agent assumes independently of this Agreement). Each Agent shall make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Company. Except as provided in Section 2(b) and Section 2(c) below, under no circumstances will any Agent be obligated to purchase any Notes for its own account. It is understood and agreed, however, that any of you may purchase Notes as principal pursuant to Section 2(b) and Section 2(c) below, as applicable. The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to instruct the Agents to suspend at any time, for any period of time or permanently, the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes. Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the Agents will forthwith suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Notes from the Company until such time as the Company has advised them that such solicitation may be resumed. Subject to the provisions of this Section 2 and to the Administrative Procedures, as applicable, offers for the purchase of Notes may be solicited by an Agent at such time and in such amounts as such Agent shall deem advisable. The Company may from time to time offer Notes for sale otherwise than through an Agent; provided, however, that so long as this Agreement is in effect the Company shall not solicit or accept offers to purchase Notes through any agent other than an Agent. If the Company defaults in its obligations to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company and the Guarantor, shall indemnify and hold each of you 5
harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company. (b) Purchases of Notes. Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, each sale of Notes shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and a supplemental agreement between the Company and the Purchasing Agent which will provide for the sale of such Notes to, and the purchase of and reoffering thereof by, the Purchasing Agent, as principal. Each such supplemental agreement (which may be either an oral or written agreement) is herein referred to as a "Terms Agreement". Each Terms Agreement shall describe the Notes to be purchased by the Purchasing Agent pursuant thereto and shall specify the terms of the offered Notes. A Terms Agreement may also specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of such Notes by the Purchasing Agent. Any written Terms Agreement may be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B. The Purchasing Agent's commitment to purchase Notes shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Delivery of the Notes sold to the Purchasing Agent pursuant to a Terms Agreement shall be made not later than the Settlement Date agreed to in such Terms Agreement, against payment of funds to the Company in the net amount due to the Company for such Notes by the method and in the form set forth in the Administrative Procedures, as applicable, unless otherwise agreed to between the Company and the Purchasing Agent in such Terms Agreement. The Company agrees to pay the Purchasing Agent a commission on the Settlement Date with respect to each sale of Notes by the Company as a result of solicitations made by the Agents, in an amount equal to that percentage specified in Schedule II hereto of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes sold by the Company; provided, however, that the Company and the Purchasing Agent may agree to a commission greater than or less than the percentages specified in Schedule II hereto; and provided, further, that in no case shall the commission exceed 8% of the initial offering proceeds. Such commission shall be payable as specified in the Administrative Procedures, and the actual aggregate commission with respect to each sale of Notes will be set forth in the relevant Pricing Supplement. The Purchasing Agent and the other Agents or Selected Dealers will share the above-mentioned commission in such proportions as they may agree. Unless otherwise agreed to between the Company and the Purchasing Agent in a Terms Agreement, any Note sold to the Purchasing Agent (i) shall be purchased by the Purchasing Agent at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof less a percentage equal to the applicable commission and (ii) may be resold by the Purchasing Agent to other Agents or Selected Dealers, each of whom will purchase as principal for resale to the public at a fixed public offering price which shall be set forth in the applicable Terms Agreement and Pricing Supplement. In connection with any resale of Notes purchased, without the consent of the Company or unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Terms Agreement, the Agents are not authorized to appoint subagents or to engage the services of any other broker or dealer or to reallow any portion of the commission paid to such Agent. 6
(c) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Purchasing Agent, each Agent shall purchase from the Purchasing Agent as principal for resale to the public such aggregate principal amount of Notes with respect to which it has communicated offers to purchase to the Purchasing Agent (the "Commitment Amount"). The agreement of each Agent to purchase Notes from the Purchasing Agent shall be deemed to be made on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Each Agent agrees to pay to the Purchasing Agent on the Settlement Date (or on such later date as may be specified by the Purchasing Agent) (i) an amount equal to the Offering Price, less the applicable commission in respect of such Agent's Commitment Amount or (ii) such other amount as the Purchasing Agent shall advise such Agent to or upon the order of the Purchasing Agent by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to an account specified by the Purchasing Agent. The Purchasing Agent will make payment to the Company against delivery to the Purchasing Agent for each Agent's account of the Notes to be purchased by each Agent, and the Purchasing Agent will deliver to each Agent the Notes paid for by such Agent. If the Purchasing Agent has determined that transactions in the Notes are to be settled through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company or another clearinghouse facility, payment for and delivery of Notes purchased by each Agent shall be made through such facilities, if such Agent is a member, or, if such Agent is not a member, settlement shall be made through such Agent's ordinary correspondent who is a member. (d) Additional Agents. Notwithstanding paragraphs 2(a), 2(b) or 2(c) above, the Company may from time to time appoint one or more additional financial institutions experienced in the distribution of securities as an Agent under this Agreement, for the duration of this Agreement (subject to Section 7 hereof) or on an issue by issue basis, pursuant to a letter (an "Agent Accession Confirmation") substantially in the form of Exhibit C to this Agreement; provided that any such additional party shall have first requested appointment as such upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement in writing to the Company pursuant to a letter (an "Agent Accession Letter") substantially in the form of Exhibit D to this Agreement whereupon it shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Agent Accession Letter and the Agent Accession Confirmation, become a party to this Agreement as an Agent, vested with all the authority, rights and powers and subject to all the duties and obligations of an Agent as if originally named as an Agent hereunder. The Company shall promptly notify the Guarantor, the Trustee and the other Agents of any such appointment, but only in the event that any such additional Agent is appointed for the duration of this Agreement. (e) Each Agent acknowledges and agrees, with respect to communications in accordance with the Administrative Procedures via https://newissue.i-deal.com, or such other website as may be from time to time maintained for use in connection with the Notes (the "Notes Website"), (i) that it is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the log-on and password it uses to access the Notes Website, (ii) that it is fully responsible for all activities that occur using its log-on and password, (iii) to notify the Company, the Guarantor and the Purchasing Agent immediately of any unauthorized use of its log-on or password or any other breach of security and (iv) that it will not use the log-on or password of any other person at any time. (f) Each Agent represents that it is a broker-dealer registered under the Exchange Act. 7
3. Offering and Sale of Notes. The Purchasing Agent, the other Agents and the Company agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by them in the Administrative Procedures, as the case may be. 4. Agreements. (A) The Company and the Guarantor agree with each of you that: (a) At any time during an Offering Period or during the time a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Act, prior to amending or supplementing either Registration Statement or the Prospectus, the Company and the Guarantor will furnish the Purchasing Agent and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, counsel to the Agents, with a copy of each proposed amendment or supplement (other than an amendment or supplement to be made pursuant to incorporation by reference of a document filed under the Exchange Act, or a Pricing Supplement or an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes) and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which they reasonably object. The Company and the Guarantor will promptly cause the Prospectus together with each amendment thereof or supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b). If the Prospectus is amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement or an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes), each Agent shall be furnished with such information relating to such filing as it may reasonably request, and no Agent shall be obligated to solicit offers to purchase Notes so long as it is not reasonably satisfied that such amendment or supplement complies in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. At any time during an Offering Period or during the time a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Act, the Company and the Guarantor will promptly advise each Agent of (i) the filing of any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus (other than a Pricing Supplement or an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes), (ii) the filing of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (iii) the receipt by the Company or the Guarantor of comments from the Commission relating to or requests by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or any amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice objecting to its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) the receipt by the Company or the Guarantor of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company and the Guarantor will use their reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the occurrence of any such suspension or objection to the use of the Registration Statement and, upon such issuance, occurrence or notice of objection, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or objection, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using their best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable. (b) If, at any time prior to the filing of the related Pricing Supplement pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to 8
make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, the Company and the Guarantor will (1) notify promptly each Agent so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (2) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (3) supply any amendment or supplement to each Agent in such quantities as such Agent may reasonably request. (c) Within the time during which a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), the Company and the Guarantor will comply with all requirements imposed upon them by the Securities Act, as now and hereafter amended, and by the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, as from time to time in force, so far as necessary to permit the continuance of sales of or dealings in the Notes as contemplated by the provisions hereof and the Prospectus. If during such period any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then existing, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of the Company and the Guarantor, during such period it is necessary to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or file a new registration statement to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company and the Guarantor promptly will notify each Agent to suspend the solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes and to cease sales of any Notes and, to the extent required under the provision in the last sentence of this subsection (b), the Company and the Guarantor promptly will amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or file a new registration statement (at the expense of the Company and the Guarantor ) so as to correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and will use their best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Prospectus (and any supplements thereto). If such amendment or supplement, and any documents, certificates, opinions and letters furnished to the Agents pursuant to subsections (k), (l) and (m) of this Section 4(A) in connection with the preparation and filing of such amendment or supplement, are reasonably satisfactory in all respects to the Purchasing Agent, in its sole discretion, upon the filing of such amendment or supplement with the Commission or effectiveness of an amendment to the Registration Statement, the Agents will resume solicitation of offers to purchase Notes hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be required to comply with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section 4(A) during any period from the time any Agent shall have been notified to suspend the solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes in its capacity as Agent (whether under this subparagraph (b) or otherwise under this Agreement) to the time the Company shall determine that solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes should be resumed; provided that if any Agent holds any Notes purchased as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement or from the Purchasing Agent, the Company and the Guarantor shall comply with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section 4(A) during the period when a Prospectus is required to be delivered pursuant to the Act. (d) The Guarantor will comply, in a timely manner, with all applicable requirements under the Exchange Act relating to the filing with the Commission of the Guarantor's reports pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and, if then applicable, of the Guarantor's proxy statements pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act. 9
(e) The Company and the Guarantor will use their best efforts to qualify the Notes for sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as any Agent reasonably designates, to maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Notes, except that neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be required in connection therewith to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. (f) Upon request, the Company and the Guarantor will furnish to the Purchasing Agent and counsel for the Agents, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and the Prospectus and to each other Agent a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and the Prospectus and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Agent may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of each preliminary and final Pricing Supplement and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplement thereto as each Agent may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to each offering that are required to be prepared, furnished or delivered by it. (g) (i) Each of the Company and the Guarantor agrees that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Purchasing Agent, and (ii) each Agent, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company and the Guarantor that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company and the Guarantor, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company or the Guarantor with the Commission or retained by the Company or the Guarantor under Rule 433; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the Free Writing Prospectuses, if any, included as a schedule to the applicable Terms Agreement. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Purchasing Agent or the Company and the Guarantor is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." Each of the Company and the Guarantor agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping. (h) So long as any of the Notes are outstanding, the Guarantor agrees to furnish to each Agent, upon its reasonable request, as soon as available, all reports and financial statements filed by or on behalf of the Guarantor with the Commission or any national securities exchange. The Guarantor shall be deemed to have furnished such information to such Agent if (i) such reports and financial statements are generally available on, and can be printed and/or downloaded from, the Securities and Exchange Commission's internet website, www.sec.gov (or any other website of which the Guarantor notifies such Agent), and (ii) such Agent has been notified by the Guarantor that such reports and financial statements have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 10
(i) The Company and the Guarantor shall, whether or not any sale of Notes is consummated or this Agreement is terminated, pay all expenses incident to the performance of their obligations under this Agreement and under any Terms Agreement, including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of its accountants and counsel; the cost of printing (or other production) and delivery of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Pricing Supplement or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, all amendments thereof and supplements thereto, the Senior Debt Indenture, and all other documents relating to the offering; the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Notes; the fees and disbursements (including reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in connection with the qualification of the Notes for sale and determination of eligibility for investment of the Notes under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any Agent may reasonably designate; the fees and disbursements of the Trustee; the fees of any agency that rates the Notes, the fees and expenses incurred with respect to any filing with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; the reasonable fees and disbursements of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, as counsel for the Agents, or other counsel for the Company and/or the Guarantor reasonably satisfactory to the Purchasing Agent, the Company and the Guarantor; and such other expenses, including, without limitation, advertising expenses as may be agreed upon by the Purchasing Agent, the Company and the Guarantor; provided, however, that with respect to any purchase of Notes by the Purchasing Agent pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the fees and disbursements of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP or other counsel to the Agents shall not be paid by either the Company or the Guarantor. (j) During the term of this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantor shall furnish to each Agent such relevant documents and certificates of officers of the Company and the Guarantor relating to the business, operations and affairs of the Company and the Guarantor, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Pricing Supplement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the Senior Debt Indenture, the Notes, this Agreement, the Administrative Procedures, any Terms Agreement and the performance by the Company and the Guarantor of their obligations hereunder or thereunder as any Agent may from time to time reasonably request. The Company and the Guarantor shall promptly notify each Agent orally, followed by written notice, of any downgrading or of the receipt by either of them of any notice of any intended downgrading in the rating accorded any securities of either the Company or the Guarantor by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or, if one of them no longer rates the securities of either the Company or the Guarantor, another "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) (2). (k) Each time the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is amended or supplemented (other than by filing with the Commission: (i) a Pricing Supplement, (ii) an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes, (iii) a Current Report on Form 8-K (or any successor item thereto), or (iv) any other amendment or supplement that the Purchasing Agent reasonably deems immaterial), the Company and the Guarantor will deliver or cause to be delivered forthwith to the Agents a certificate of the Company and the Guarantor, signed by (A) on behalf of the Company, the Chairman, the President or any Vice President and by the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer, the Controller, the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary and, (B) on behalf of the Guarantor, the Chairman, any Vice Chairman, any Vice President, the principal financial officer, the General Counsel, the 11
Controller, any Deputy Controller or the principal accounting officer and by the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer, the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary (or another officer or officers acceptable to the Purchasing Agent), dated the date of the effectiveness of such amendment or the date of filing with the Commission of such supplement or document, as the case may be, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Purchasing Agent, to the effect that the statements contained in the certificate referred to in Section 5(b) (iii) that was last furnished to the Agents (either pursuant to Section 5(b) (iii) or pursuant to this Section 4(A)(l)) are true and correct at the time of the effectiveness of such amendment or the time of filing of such supplement or document, as the case may be, as though made at and as of such time (except that such statements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement, as amended at the time of effectiveness of such amendment, and to the Prospectus, as amended and supplemented at the date of such certificate) or, in lieu of such certificate, a certificate of the same tenor as the certificate referred to in Section 5(b) (iii) but modified, if necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement, as amended at the time of the effectiveness of such amendment, and to the Prospectus, as amended and supplemented at the date of such certificate. (l) Each time the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is amended or supplemented (other than by filing with the Commission: (i) a Pricing Supplement, (ii) an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes, (iii) a Current Report on Form 8-K (or any successor item thereto), or (iv) any other amendment or supplement that the Purchasing Agent reasonably deems immaterial), the Company and the Guarantor shall furnish to or cause to be furnished forthwith to the Agents the written opinion of the General Counsel, Finance and Capital Markets of the Guarantor, or other counsel for the Company and/or the Guarantor reasonably satisfactory to the Purchasing Agent, dated the date of the effectiveness of such amendment or the date of filing with the Commission of such supplement or document, as the case may be, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Purchasing Agent, to the effect set forth in Exhibit F hereto. In lieu of such opinion, counsel last furnishing such an opinion to the Agents may furnish to the Agents a letter to the effect that the Agents may rely on such last opinion to the same extent as though it were dated the date of such letter and authorizing reliance on such last opinion (except that statements in such last opinion will be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement, as amended at the time of the effectiveness of such amendment, and to the Prospectus, as amended and supplemented at the date of such letter). (m) Each time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is amended or supplemented to set forth amended or supplemental financial information supplemented (other than by filing with the Commission: (i) a Pricing Supplement, (ii) an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes, (iii) a Current Report on Form 8-K (or any successor item thereto), or (iv) any other amendment or supplement that the Purchasing Agent reasonably deems immaterial), the Guarantor shall cause KPMG LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, forthwith to furnish the Agents a letter, dated the date of the effectiveness of such amendment or the date of filing of such supplement or document, as the case may be, in form satisfactory to the Purchasing Agent, of the same tenor as the letter of such independent public accountants referred to in Section 5(b)(iv) hereof but modified to relate to the Registration Statement and Prospectus, as amended and supplemented to the date of such letter, with such changes as may be necessary to reflect changes in the financial statements and other information derived from the accounting records of the Guarantor; provided, however, that if the Registration Statement or the Prospectus is amended or 12
supplemented solely to include or incorporate by reference financial information with respect to a fiscal quarter, KPMG LLP may limit the scope of such letter to the unaudited financial statements included in such amendment or supplement. (n) Each acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes and each sale of Notes to the Purchasing Agent shall be deemed to be an affirmation that the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects at the time of such acceptance or sale, as the case may be, as though made at and as of such time, and an undertaking that such representations and warranties will be true and correct in all material respects at the time of delivery to the Purchasing Agent of the Notes relating to such acceptance, as the case may be, as though made at and as of such time (and it is understood that such representations and warranties shall relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented to each such time). (o) Anything to the contrary in this Section 4 notwithstanding, if, at the time of any required notice, amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, the Company shall have instructed the Agents to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes and no Agent then holds any Notes acquired by it as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement or from the Purchasing Agent, neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be obligated to furnish or cause to be furnished any notice, certificate, opinion or letter otherwise required until such time as it shall determine that solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes should be resumed; and provided, further, that, prior to resuming such solicitation the Agents shall be entitled to receive any such notices, certificates, opinions or letters not previously furnished, accurate as of the date of such notice, certificate, opinion or letter. 5. Conditions to the Obligations of the Agents. The obligations of each Agent under the terms of this Agreement will be subject to the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company and the Guarantor herein contained, to the accuracy of the statements of the officers of the Company and the Guarantor made in each certificate furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof and to the performance and observance by the Company and the Guarantor of all covenants and agreements herein contained on their part to be performed and observed (in the case of any Agent's obligations to solicit offers to purchase Notes, at the time of such solicitation, and, in the case of any Agent's obligation to purchase Notes, at the time the Company accepts the offer from the Purchasing Agent to purchase such Notes and at the time of purchase by the Purchasing Agent) and (in each case) to the following additional conditions precedent when and as specified: (a) On the corresponding Settlement Date: (i) The Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, have been filed in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) and any other material required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d), shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433; and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or threatened. 13
(ii) There shall not have occurred any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company, the Guarantor and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and any final Pricing Supplement (exclusive of any supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to above, is, in the sole judgment of an Agent after consultation with the Company, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Notes as contemplated by the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, except as disclosed to the Agents in writing by the Company and the Guarantor before the Company accepted the offer of the Purchasing Agent to purchase such Notes. (iii) There shall not have occurred any (x) suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange, or any suspension of trading of the Guarantor's common stock by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, (y) declaration of a general moratorium on commercial banking activities by either federal or New York state authorities or exchange controls shall have been imposed by the United States or (z) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, any declaration by the United States of war or national emergency or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such to as to make it, in the Purchasing Agent's sole judgment, after consultation with the Company, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering of the Notes as contemplated by the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, except for any such event occurring before the Company accepted the offer of the Purchasing Agent to purchase such Notes. (iv) There shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's or the Guarantor's senior debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, except as disclosed to the Agents in writing by the Company and the Guarantor before the Company accepted the offer of the Purchasing Agent to purchase such Notes. (b) On the Commencement Date and, if called for by any Terms Agreement, on the corresponding Settlement Date: (i) The Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to the Agents the opinion of the General Counsel, Finance and Capital Markets of the Guarantor (or other counsel for the Company and/or the Guarantor reasonably acceptable to the Agents) on the Commencement Date, and, on the Settlement Date will furnish the opinion of the General Counsel, Finance and Capital Markets of the Guarantor (or other counsel for the Company and/or the Guarantor reasonably acceptable to the Agents) and, if called for by a Terms Agreement, the opinion of other counsel, dated the Commencement Date or the Settlement Date, as the case may be, to the effect set forth in Exhibit F hereto. 14
(ii) The Agents shall have received from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, counsel for the Agents (or other counsel reasonably acceptable to the Purchasing Agent, the Company and the Guarantor), an opinion dated the Commencement Date or the Settlement Date, as the case may be, to the effect set forth in Exhibit G hereto. (iii) The Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to the Agents a certificate of the Company and the Guarantor, signed by (A) on behalf of the Company -- the Chairman, the President or any Vice President and by the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer, the Controller, the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary and (B) on behalf of the Guarantor -- the Chairman, any Vice Chairman, the President, any Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Accounting Officer, the General Counsel, the Controller or any Deputy Controller and by the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer, the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary (or another officer or officers acceptable to the Agents), dated the Commencement Date or the Settlement Date, as the case may be, to the effect that each signatory of such certificate has carefully examined the Registration Statement, as amended as of the date of such certificate, the Prospectus, as amended and supplemented as of the date of such certificate, the Disclosure Package and this Agreement and that: (A) the respective representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the date of such certificate with the same effect as if made on the date of such certificate and the Company and the Guarantor have complied in all material respects with all the respective agreements and satisfied all the conditions on their part to be performed or satisfied as a condition to the obligations of the Agents under this Agreement; (B) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to their knowledge, have been threatened or communicated by the Commission to the Company or the Guarantor as being contemplated by it under the Securities Act; and (C) since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, each as amended and supplemented, there has been no material adverse change in the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which is not disclosed in the Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, as amended or supplemented. (iv) KPMG LLP or another nationally recognized independent registered public accounting firm shall have furnished to the Agents a letter or letters, dated the Commencement Date or the Settlement Date, as the case may be, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agents, to the effect set forth in Exhibit H and Exhibit I hereto. 15
(v) The Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to the Agents such appropriate further information, certificates and documents as the Agents may reasonably request. The documents required to be delivered by this Section 5 shall be delivered at the office of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, counsel for the Agents, at One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York 10006, on the Commencement Date or the Settlement Date, as the case may be. 6. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company and the Guarantor agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Agent and each person who controls any Agent within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Notes as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Prospectus, any preliminary or final Pricing Supplement or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company and the Guarantor will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by or on behalf of any Agent through the Purchasing Agent specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Guarantor may otherwise have. (b) Each Agent severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to each Agent, but only with reference to written information relating to such Agent furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by or on behalf of such Agent through the Purchasing Agent specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Agent may otherwise have. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless 16
and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the Guarantor and the Agents severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company, the Guarantor and one or more of the Agents may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and by the Agents on the other from the offering of the Notes; provided, however, that in no case shall (i) any Agent (except as may be provided in any agreement among Agents relating to the offering of the Notes) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Notes purchased by such Agent hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the Guarantor and the Agents severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds 17
from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and benefits received by the Agents shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth in the Pricing Supplement. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand or the Agents on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantor and the Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 6, each person who controls an Agent within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Agent shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each person who controls the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). 7. Termination. This Agreement will continue in effect until terminated as provided in this Section 7. This Agreement may be terminated by either the Company and the Guarantor as to any Agent, or by any Agent, insofar as this Agreement relates to such Agent, by giving written notice of such termination to such Agent or the Company and the Guarantor, as the case may be. The termination of this Agreement shall not require termination of any agreement by the Purchasing Agent to purchase Notes as principal, and the termination of any such Agreement shall not require termination of this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated, neither the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, nor any Agent, on the other hand, shall have any liability to each other, except (i) as provided in the fourth paragraph of Section 2(a), clause 3 of Section 4(A)(b), the last proviso of Section 4(A)(c), and Sections 4(A)(i), 6, 8 and 11, (ii) that the Company or, failing which, the Guarantor, shall reimburse the Agents, through the Purchasing Agent, for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with any proposed but not completed purchase and sale of Notes, and (iii) that, if at the time of termination an offer to purchase any of the Notes has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser of the Note or Notes relating thereto has not occurred, the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor stated in Section 2 and the Company's obligations under the Administrative Procedures, and in Sections 2(c), 4(A)(a), 4(A)(b), 4(A)(c), 4(A)(d), 4(A)(f), 4(A)(g), 4(A)(j), 4(A)(k), 4(A)(l), 4(A)(m), 4(A)(n), and 5 shall also remain in full force and effect and not be terminated until the delivery of such Notes. 8. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. With respect to any Agent's solicitation of offers to purchase Notes or the Purchasing Agent's obligation to purchase Notes pursuant to any Terms Agreement or any Agent's commitment to purchase Notes from the 18
Purchasing Agent, the respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company and the Guarantor or their officers and of any of you set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of you, the Company, the Guarantor or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 6 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Notes for a period extending to the earlier of (i) three years from the corresponding Settlement Date for such Notes or (ii) the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations governing such solicitation or purchase of Notes. 9. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to an Agent, will be delivered or sent by mail or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication and confirmed to such Agent, at the address specified in Schedule I hereto; or, if sent to the Company, will be delivered or sent by mail or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication and confirmed to it at Citigroup Funding Inc., 388 Greenwich Street, 38th Floor, New York, New York 10013, Attention: Assistant Treasurer (fax no: (212) 816-3619); and if sent to the Guarantor, will be delivered or sent by mail or transmitted by any standard form of telecommunication and confirmed to it at Citigroup Inc., 425 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10043, Attention: General Counsel, Finance and Capital Markets. 10. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 6 hereof. Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement or any Terms Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any person, firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and the controlling persons and officers and directors referred to in Section 6 and their heirs and legal representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any Terms Agreement or any provision herein or therein contained. This Agreement and any Terms Agreement and all conditions and provisions hereof and thereof except to the extent provided for in Section 5 hereof are intended to be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and said controlling persons and officers and directors and their heirs and legal representatives, and for the benefit of no other person, firm or corporation. No purchaser of Notes shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such purchase. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of any of you hereunder may not be assigned without the prior written consent of the Company and the Guarantor. 11. Waivers. Neither any failure nor delay on the part of any party to exercise any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement (singly and collectively referred to as a "Right") shall operate as a waiver of such Right, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any Right preclude any other or further exercise of any Right, nor shall any waiver of any Right with respect to any occurrence be construed as a waiver of any Right with respect to any other occurrence. 12. No Fiduciary Duty. The Company and the Guarantor hereby acknowledge that (i) the purchase and sale of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Agents and any affiliate through which it may be acting, on the other, (ii) the Agents are acting as principal and not as an agent or fiduciary of the Company or the Guarantor and (iii) the 19
Company's engagement of the Agents in connection with the offering and the process leading up to the offering is as independent contractors and not in any other capacity. Furthermore, each of the Company and the Guarantor agrees that it is solely responsible for making its own judgments in connection with the offering (irrespective of whether any of the Agents has advised or is currently advising the Company or the Guarantor on related or other matters). The Company and the Guarantor agree that they will not claim that the Agents have rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owe an agency, fiduciary or similar duty to the Company or the Guarantor, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto. 13. Integration. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company, the Guarantor and the Agents, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. 14. Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed within the State of New York. 15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 16. Headings. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. 20
