1. Representations and Warranties. The Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally represent and warrant to, and agree with, each of you as set forth below in this Section 1. (a) The Company and the Guarantor meet the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and have prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") an automatic shelf registration statement, as defined in Rule 405, (File No. 333-132370), including a related base prospectus dated March 10, 2006 (the "Base Prospectus") and forms of prospectus supplement relating to the Notes, for registration under the Securities Act of the offering and sale of the Notes. Such automatic shelf registration statement, including exhibits and financial statements but excluding all Forms T-1, and any prospectus supplement or pricing supplement relating to the Notes that is filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) and deemed part of such automatic shelf registration statement pursuant to Rule 430B, as amended on each Effective Date is referred to herein as the "Registration Statement". Such Registration Statement, including any amendments thereto filed prior to the date of this Agreement, became effective upon filing. The Company and the Guarantor have filed with the Commission a final prospectus supplement relating to the Medium-Term Notes and the plan of distribution thereof (the "U.S. Prospectus Supplement") and a final prospectus supplement relating to the Euro Medium-Term Notes and the plan of distribution thereof (the "Euro Prospectus Supplement", together with the U.S. Prospectus Supplement, the "Prospectus Supplements" and together with the Base Prospectus (including the U.S. Prospectus Supplement or the Euro Prospectus Supplement, as the case may be), the "Prospectuses"). As filed, such Prospectus Supplements contained all information required by the Securities Act and the rules thereunder, and, were in all substantive respects in the form furnished to you prior to the date of filing; provided that the terms of a particular offering of the Notes will be set forth in a supplement to the relevant Prospectus Supplement (a "Pricing Supplement") which the Company and the Guarantor will file with the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b). The Registration Statement, as of the date of this Agreement, meets the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x). The initial Effective Date of the Registration Statement was not earlier than the date three years before the date of this Agreement; (b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectuses, when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder, and any further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the Prospectuses, or any further amendment or supplement thereto, when such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; (c) On each Effective Date, the Registration Statement did, and when the Prospectus Supplements were first filed in accordance with Rule 424(b) and on the Commencement Date (as defined in Section 2(a) below) and on the date of delivery of and payment for a particular issue of Notes (the "Settlement Date"), the Prospectus Supplements did and any supplements thereto will comply in all material respects with the 3
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust Indenture Act") and the respective rules thereunder; on each Effective Date and at the time sales of a particular offering of the Notes are confirmed (the "Time of Sale"), the Registration Statement did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; and on the Effective Date, on the Commencement Date and on the Settlement Date, the Indenture did or will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Trust Indenture Act and the rules thereunder; on the date of any filing pursuant to Rule 424(b), on the Commencement Date and on the Settlement Date, the Prospectuses did not and any supplement thereto will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Company and the Guarantor make no representations or warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee or (ii) the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus Supplements or applicable Pricing Supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of either Agent specifically for inclusion in the Registration Statement or Prospectuses (and any supplement thereto); (d) As of the Time of Sale, the Disclosure Package (as defined below), when taken together with the terms of the Notes set forth in the applicable Pricing Supplement, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by either Agent specifically for use therein. The "Disclosure Package" means (i) the Base Prospectus, as amended and supplemented most recently prior to the Time of Sale, (ii) any relevant prospectus supplement, (iii) the related preliminary Pricing Supplement, if any, used most recently prior to the Time of Sale and (iv) any applicable issuer free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act (each an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus"), filed with the Commission under Rule 433 prior to the Time of Sale; (e) (i) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), (iii) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c)) made any offer relating to the Notes in reliance on the exemption in Rule 163 and (iv) at the Time of Sale (with such time being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (iv)), each of the Company and the Guarantor was or is (as the case may be) a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405. The Company agrees to pay the fees required by the Commission relating to the Notes within the time required by Rule 456(b)(1) without regard to the proviso therein and otherwise in accordance with Rules 456(b) and 457(r); 4
(f) (i) At the earliest time after the filing of the Registration Statement that the Company or another offering participant made a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2)) of the Notes and (ii) as of the Time of Sale (with such time being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (ii)), neither the Company nor the Guarantor was and is an Ineligible Issuer (as defined in Rule 405), without taking account of any determination by the Commission pursuant to Rule 405 that it is not necessary that the Company or the Guarantor be considered an Ineligible Issuer; (g) Each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and Final Term Sheet (as defined in Section 4(g) below) does not include any information that conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated therein and any prospectus supplement or pricing supplement deemed to be a part thereof that has not been superseded or modified. The foregoing two sentences do not apply to statements in or omissions from the Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or Final Term Sheet based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by either Agent specifically for use therein; (h) The Notes have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the applicable Indenture and delivered to and duly paid for by the purchasers thereof, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms and entitled to the benefits of the applicable Indenture (subject, as to enforcement, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); the Indentures have been duly authorized by the Company and qualified under the Trust Indenture Act; and the Indentures conform to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectuses as amended or supplemented to relate to such issuance of Notes; (i) The Guarantees have been duly authorized and, when the Notes have been executed, authenticated and delivered by the Guarantor in accordance with the applicable Indenture, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the applicable Indenture; and (j) Since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Prospectuses or the Disclosure Package, each as amended or supplemented, there has not been any material adverse change in the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which is not disclosed in the Prospectuses or the Disclosure Package, each as amended or supplemented. 2. Appointment of Agents. Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and subject to the reservation by the Company of the right to sell Notes to either of you acting as principal at a discount for its own account or for resale to one or more investors or other dealers and the Company's right to sell Notes directly to investors on its own behalf or through other agents, the Company hereby appoints and authorizes the U.S. Agent and the International Agent to act as its agents to solicit offers for the purchase of all or part of the Medium-Term Notes and Euro Medium-Term Notes, respectively, from the Company; provided, however, that only the International Agent may solicit offers for the purchase of Euro Medium-Term Notes. 5
(a) Solicitations of Offers to Purchase Notes. Following the Commencement Date (defined below), the Company shall notify each Agent from time to time as to the commencement of a period during which the Notes may be offered and sold by the Agents (each period, commencing with such a notification and ending at such time as the authorization for offers and sales through the Agents shall have been suspended by the Company or the Agents as provided hereunder, being herein referred to as an "Offering Period"). The initial Offering Period shall begin on April 20, 2006 (the "Commencement Date"). On the basis of the representations and warranties, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each of the U.S. Agent and the International Agent agrees, as agent of the Company, to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit offers to purchase Medium-Term Notes and Euro Medium-Term Notes, respectively, from the Company upon the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Prospectus (and any supplement thereto) and in the U.S. or Euro Procedures, as applicable. Each Agent shall communicate to the Company, orally or in writing, each reasonable offer or indication of interest to purchase Notes received by such Agent as agent. The Company shall have the sole right to accept offers to purchase the Notes and may reject any such offer in whole or in part. Each Agent shall have the right to reject, in its discretion reasonably exercised, any offer received by it to purchase the Notes, in whole or in part, and any such rejection shall not be deemed a breach of its agreements contained herein. In soliciting offers to purchase the Notes in its capacity as agent of the Company, each Agent is acting solely as agent for the Company, and not as principal, and does not assume any obligation toward or relationship of agency or trust with any purchaser of the Notes (other than any such obligation or relationship which the Agent assumes independently of this Agreement). Each Agent shall make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Notes has been solicited by such Agent and accepted by the Company, but such Agent shall not, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, be obligated to disclose the identity of any purchaser or have any liability to the Company in the event any such purchase is not consummated for any reason. Except as provided in Section 2(b), under no circumstances will either Agent be obligated to purchase any Notes for its own account. It is understood and agreed, however, that any of you may purchase Notes as principal pursuant to Section 2(b). The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to instruct the U.S. Agent and the International Agent to suspend at any time, for any period of time or permanently, the solicitation of offers to purchase Notes. Upon receipt of instructions from the Company, the U.S. Agent and the International Agent (or either or both of them, as the case may be) will forthwith suspend solicitation of offers to purchase Notes from the Company until such time as the Company has advised them that such solicitation may be resumed. The Company agrees to pay each Agent a commission, on the Settlement Date with respect to each sale of Notes by the Company as a result of a solicitation made by such Agent, in an amount agreed upon by the Agent and the Company. Such commission shall be payable as specified in the U.S. or Euro Procedures, as applicable. Without the prior approval of the Company, no Agent (acting on an agency basis) may reallow any portion of the commission payable pursuant hereto to dealers or purchasers in connection with the offer and sale of any Notes. 6
Subject to the provisions of this Section 2 and to the U.S. or Euro Procedures, as applicable, offers for the purchase of Notes may be solicited by an Agent as agent for the Company at such time and in such amounts as such Agent shall deem advisable. The Company may from time to time offer Notes for sale otherwise than through an Agent; provided, however, that so long as this Agreement is in effect the Company shall not solicit or accept offers to purchase Notes through any agent other than an Agent. If the Company defaults in its obligations to deliver Notes to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the Company and the Guarantor shall indemnify and hold each of you harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company. (b) Purchases of Notes. Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein, whenever the Company and any of you determine that the Company shall sell Notes directly to any of you as principal (in such capacity, the "Purchaser"), each such sale of Notes shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and a supplemental agreement relating to such sale. Each such supplemental agreement (which may be either an oral or written agreement) is herein referred to as a "Terms Agreement". Each Terms Agreement shall describe the Notes to be purchased by the Purchaser pursuant thereto and shall specify the terms of the offered Notes. A Terms Agreement may also specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of such Notes by the Purchaser. Any written Terms Agreement may be in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C. The Purchaser's commitment to purchase Notes shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. Delivery of the Notes sold to the Purchaser pursuant to a Terms Agreement shall be made not later than the Settlement Date specified in the Terms Agreement against payment of funds to the Company in the net amount due to the Company for such Notes by the method and in the form set forth in the U.S. or Euro Procedures, as applicable, unless otherwise agreed to between the Company and the Purchaser. Unless otherwise agreed to between the Company and the Purchaser in a Terms Agreement, any Note sold to a Purchaser (i) shall be purchased by such Purchaser at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof less a percentage equal to the applicable commission and (ii) may be resold by such Purchaser at varying prices from time to time or, if set forth in the applicable Terms Agreement and Pricing Supplement, at a fixed public offering price. In connection with any resale of Notes purchased, a Purchaser may use a selling or dealer group and may reallow to any broker or dealer any portion of the discount or commission payable pursuant hereto. (c) Additional Agents. Notwithstanding paragraph 2(a) or 2(b) above, the Company may from time to time appoint one or more additional financial institutions experienced in the distribution of securities as a U.S. Agent or International Agent under this Agreement, for the duration of this Agreement (subject to Section 7 hereof) or on an issue by issue basis, pursuant to a letter (an "Agent Accession Confirmation") substantially in the form of 7
Exhibit D or Exhibit F to this Agreement, as appropriate, provided that any such additional party shall have first requested appointment as such upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement in writing to the Company pursuant to a letter (an "Agent Accession Letter") substantially in the form of Exhibit E or Exhibit G to this Agreement, as appropriate, whereupon it shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the relevant Agent Accession Letter and the relevant Agent Accession Confirmation, become a party to this Agreement as a U.S. Agent, or an International Agent, as specified in the relevant Agent Accession Letter, vested with all the authority, rights and powers and subject to all the duties and obligations of an Agent as if originally named as an Agent hereunder. The Company shall promptly notify the Guarantor, the Trustees and the other Agents of any such appointment, but only in the event that any such additional Agent is appointed for the duration of this Agreement. 3. Offering and Sale of Notes. The U.S. Agent, the International Agent and the Company agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically provided to be performed by them in the U.S. or Euro Procedures, as the case may be. In connection with any offering of Euro Medium-Term Notes, the International Agent may act as stabilizing agent (the "Stabilizing Agent"), and as Stabilizing Agent may over-allot or effect transactions which stabilize or maintain the market price of the Euro Medium-Term Notes at a level which might not otherwise prevail. Such stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. The Stabilizing Agent, whose identity shall be disclosed in the applicable supplement to the Prospectus relating to such offering of Euro Medium-Term Notes, shall comply with all applicable laws. 4. Agreements. (A) The Company and the Guarantor agree with each of you that: (a) At any time during an Offering Period or during the time a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Securities Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), prior to amending or supplementing either Registration Statement or either Prospectus, the Company and the Guarantor will furnish the Agents and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, counsel to the Agents, with a copy of each proposed amendment or supplement (other than an amendment or supplement to be made pursuant to incorporation by reference of a document filed under the Exchange Act, or a Pricing Supplement or an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes) and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which they reasonably object. The Company and the Guarantor will promptly cause each amendment of or supplement to either Prospectus to be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b). If either Prospectus is amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement or an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes), each Agent shall be furnished with such information relating to such filing as it may reasonably request, and no Agent shall be obligated to solicit offers to purchase Notes so long as it is not reasonably satisfied that such amendment or supplement complies in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. At any time during an Offering Period or during the time a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, the Company and the Guarantor will promptly advise each 8
Agent of (i) the filing of any amendment or supplement to either Prospectus (other than a Pricing Supplement or an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes), (ii) the filing of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (iii) the receipt by the Company or the Guarantor of comments from the Commission relating to or requests by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or any amendment of or supplement to either Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice objecting to its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) the receipt by the Company or the Guarantor of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company and the Guarantor will use their reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the occurrence of any such suspension or objection to the use of the Registration Statement and, upon such issuance, occurrence or notice of objection, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or objection, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using their best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable. (b) If, at any time prior to the filing of the related Pricing Supplement pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, the Company and the Guarantor will (1) notify promptly each Agent so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (2) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (3) supply any amendment or supplement to each Agent in such quantities as such Agent may reasonably request. (c) At any time during an Offering Period, the Company and the Guarantor will comply with all requirements imposed upon them by the Securities Act, as now and hereafter amended, and by the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, as from time to time in force, so far as necessary to permit the continuance of sales of or dealings in the Notes as contemplated by the provisions hereof and the relevant Prospectus. If during such period any event occurs as a result of which either Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then existing, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of the Company and the Guarantor, during such period it is necessary to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or either Prospectus or file a new registration statement to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company and the Guarantor promptly will notify each Agent to suspend the solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes and to cease sales of any Notes. To the extent required under the provision in the last sentence of this subsection (c), the Company and the Guarantor promptly will amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the relevant Prospectus or file a new registration statement (at the expense of the Company and the Guarantor) so as to correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and will use their best efforts to have any amendment to the 9
Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the relevant Prospectus (and any supplements thereto). If such amendment or supplement, and any documents, certificates, opinions and letters furnished to the Agents pursuant to subsections (m), (n) and (o) of this Section 4(A) in connection with the preparation and filing of such amendment or supplement, are reasonably satisfactory in all respects to the Agents, in their sole discretion, upon the filing of such amendment or supplement with the Commission or effectiveness of an amendment to the Registration Statement, the Agents will resume solicitation of offers to purchase Notes hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be required to comply with the provisions of subsection (c) of this Section 4(A) during any period from the time any Agent shall have been notified to suspend the solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes in its capacity as Agent (whether under this subparagraph (c) or otherwise under this Agreement) to the time the Company shall determine that solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes should be resumed; provided that if any Agent holds any Notes purchased as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company and the Guarantor shall comply with the provisions of subsection (c) of this Section 4(A) during the period when a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered pursuant to the Securities Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172). (d) The Guarantor will comply, in a timely manner, with all applicable requirements under the Exchange Act relating to the filing with the Commission of the Guarantor's reports pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and, if then applicable, of the Guarantor's proxy statements pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act. (e) The Company and the Guarantor will use their best efforts to qualify the Notes for sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as either Agent reasonably designates, to maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Notes and, if requested by such Agent, to arrange for the determination of the legality of the Notes for purchase by institutional investors, except that neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be required in connection therewith to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. (f) Upon request, the Company and the Guarantor will furnish to the Agents and counsel for the Agents, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and the Prospectuses and, so long as delivery of a prospectus relating to the Notes by an Agent may be required by the Securities Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of each additional prospectus supplement, Pricing Supplement and Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplements thereto as each Agent may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to each offering that are required to be prepared, furnished or delivered by it. 10
(g) Upon request, the Company will prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of final terms of the Securities and the offering thereof (a "Final Term Sheet"), in a form approved by the relevant Agent and will file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time required by such Rule. (h) (i) Each of the Company and the Guarantor agrees that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the relevant Agent, and (ii) each Agent, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company and the Guarantor that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company and the Guarantor, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Notes that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company or the Guarantor with the Commission or retained by the Company or the Guarantor under Rule 433; provided that the prior written consent of the parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of any Final Term Sheet and any free writing prospectus prepared by an Agent in connection with a specific offering of the Notes and approved for use by the Company and the Guarantor. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the relevant Agent or the Company and the Guarantor is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." Each of the Company and the Guarantor agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping. (i) So long as any of the Notes are outstanding, the Guarantor agrees to furnish to each Agent, upon its reasonable request, as soon as available, all reports and financial statements filed by or on behalf of the Guarantor with the Commission or any national securities exchange. The Guarantor shall be deemed to have furnished such information to such Agent if (i) such reports and financial statements are generally available on, and can be printed and/or downloaded from, the Securities and Exchange Commission's internet website, www.sec.gov (or any other website of which the Guarantor notifies such Agent), and (ii) such Agent has been notified by the Guarantor that such reports and financial statements have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (j) The Company and the Guarantor shall, whether or not any sale of Notes is consummated or this Agreement is terminated, pay all expenses incident to the performance of their obligations under this Agreement and under any Terms Agreement, including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of its accountants and counsel; the cost of printing (or other production) and delivery of the Registration Statement, the Prospectuses, any Pricing Supplements, Final Term Sheets or Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses, all amendments thereof and supplements thereto, the Indentures, and all other documents relating to the offering, the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Notes; the fees and disbursements (including reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in connection with the qualification of the Notes for sale and determination of eligibility for investment of the Notes under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the relevant Agent may reasonably designate; the fees and disbursements of the Trustees; the fees of any agency that rates the Notes; the fees and expenses in connection 11
with any listing of the Notes on The NASDAQ Stock Market, the American Stock Exchange, Luxembourg Stock Exchange or such other securities exchange agreed to by the Company; the fees and expenses incurred with respect to any filing with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; the reasonable fees and disbursements of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, as counsel for the Agents, or other counsel reasonably satisfactory to each of the Agents, the Company and the Guarantor; and such other expenses, including, without limitation, advertising expenses as may be agreed upon by the Agents, the Company and the Guarantor; provided, however, that with respect to any purchase of Notes by one of you as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the fees and disbursements of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP or other counsel to you shall not be paid by either the Company or the Guarantor. (k) During the term of this Agreement, the Company and the Guarantor shall furnish to each Agent such relevant documents and certificates of officers of the Company and the Guarantor relating to the business, operations and affairs of the Company and the Guarantor, the Registration Statement, the Prospectuses, any Pricing Supplement, Final Term Sheet and Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the Indentures, the Notes, this Agreement, the Procedures, any Terms Agreement and the performance by the Company and the Guarantor of their obligations hereunder or thereunder as either Agent may from time to time reasonably request. The Company and the Guarantor shall promptly notify each Agent orally, followed by written notice, of any downgrading or of the receipt by either of them of any notice of any intended downgrading in the rating accorded any securities of either the Company or the Guarantor by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or, if one of them no longer rates the securities of either the Company or the Guarantor, another "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) (2). (l) If any issue of Medium-Term Notes is to be listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market, the American Stock Exchange or such other securities exchange agreed to by the Company, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Company and the Guarantor will use their best efforts to obtain the listing of such issue of Medium-Term Notes on such securities exchange, to furnish to such securities exchange all documents, information and undertakings that may be reasonably necessary in order to effect such listing, and to cause such listing to be continued so long as any of the Medium-Term Notes of such issue remain outstanding. (m) Each time the Registration Statement or the Prospectuses are amended or supplemented (other than by filing with the Commission: (i) a Pricing Supplement, (ii) an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes, (iii) a Current Report on Form 8-K (or any successor item thereto), or (iv) any other amendment or supplement that the Agents reasonably deem immaterial), the Company and the Guarantor will deliver or cause to be delivered forthwith to the Agents a certificate of the Company and the Guarantor, signed by (A) on behalf of the Company, the Chairman, the President or any Vice President and by the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer, the Controller, the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary and, (B) on behalf of the Guarantor, the Chairman, any Vice Chairman, any Vice President, the principal financial officer, the General Counsel, the Controller, any Deputy Controller or the principal accounting officer and by the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer, the 12
Secretary or any Assistant Secretary (or another officer or officers acceptable to the Agents), dated the date of the effectiveness of such amendment or the date of filing with the Commission of such supplement or document, as the case may be, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Agents, to the effect that the statements contained in the certificate referred to in Section 5(b) (iii) that was last furnished to the Agents (either pursuant to Section 5(b) (iii) or pursuant to this Section 4(A)(m)) are true and correct at the time of the effectiveness of such amendment or the time of filing of such supplement or document, as the case may be, as though made at and as of such time (except that such statements shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement, as amended at the time of effectiveness of such amendment, and to the relevant Prospectus, as amended and supplemented at the date of such certificate) or, in lieu of such certificate, a certificate of the same tenor as the certificate referred to in Section 5(b) (iii) but modified, if necessary, to relate to the Registration Statement, as amended at the time of the effectiveness of such amendment, and to the relevant Prospectus, as amended and supplemented at the date of such certificate. (n) Each time the Registration Statement or the Prospectuses are amended or supplemented (other than by filing with the Commission: (i) a Pricing Supplement, (ii) an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes, (iii) a Current Report on Form 8-K (or any successor item thereto), or (iv) any other amendment or supplement that the Agents reasonably deems immaterial), the Company and the Guarantor shall furnish to or cause to be furnished forthwith to the Agents the written opinion of the General Counsel, Finance and Capital Markets of the Guarantor, or other counsel for the Company and/or the Guarantor reasonably satisfactory to the Agents, dated the date of the effectiveness of such amendment or the date of filing with the Commission of such supplement or document, as the case may be, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Agents, to the effect set forth in Exhibit H hereto. In lieu of such opinion, counsel last furnishing such an opinion to the Agents may furnish to the Agents a letter to the effect that the Agents may rely on such last opinion to the same extent as though it were dated the date of such letter and authorizing reliance on such last opinion (except that statements in such last opinion will be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement, as amended at the time of the effectiveness of such amendment, and to the Prospectuses, as amended and supplemented at the date of such letter). (o) Each time that the Registration Statement or the Prospectuses are amended or supplemented to set forth amended or supplemental financial information supplemented (other than by filing with the Commission: (i) a Pricing Supplement, (ii) an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes, (iii) a Current Report on Form 8-K (or any successor item thereto), or (iv) any other amendment or supplement that the Agents reasonably deems immaterial), the Guarantor shall cause KPMG LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, forthwith to furnish the Agents a letter, dated the date of the effectiveness of such amendment or the date of filing of such supplement or document, as the case may be, in form satisfactory to the Agents, of the same tenor as the letter of such independent public accountants referred to in Section 5(b)(iv) hereof but modified to relate to the Registration Statement and Prospectuses, as amended and supplemented to the date of such letter, with such changes as may be necessary to reflect changes in the financial statements and other information derived from the accounting records of the Guarantor; provided, however, that if the Registration Statement or the Prospectuses are amended or supplemented solely to include 13
or incorporate by reference financial information with respect to a fiscal quarter, KPMG LLP may limit the scope of such letter to the unaudited financial statements included in such amendment or supplement. (p) Each acceptance by the Company of an offer for the purchase of Notes and each sale of Notes to any of you as principal shall be deemed to be an affirmation that the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects at the time of such acceptance or sale, as the case may be, as though made at and as of such time, and an undertaking that such representations and warranties will be true and correct in all material respects at the time of delivery to the purchaser or his agent, or an Agent, or any of you acting as principal, of the Notes relating to such acceptance, as the case may be, as though made at and as of such time (and it is understood that such representations and warranties shall relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectuses as amended and supplemented to each such time). (q) Anything to the contrary in this Section 4 notwithstanding, if, at the time of any required notice, amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Prospectuses, the Company shall have instructed the Agents to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes in each Agent's capacity as agent of the Company and either Agent does not then hold any Notes acquired by it as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement, neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be obligated to furnish or cause to be furnished any notice, certificate, opinion or letter otherwise required until such time as it shall determine that solicitation of offers to purchase the Notes should be resumed; and provided, further, that, prior to resuming such solicitation the Agents shall be entitled to receive any such notices, certificates, opinions or letters not previously furnished, accurate as of the date of such notice, certificate, opinion or letter. (r) The Company, the Guarantor and their respective affiliates will comply with the provisions of U.S. Treasury Regulations 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(1) and (2). (s) If any issue of Euro Medium-Term Notes is to be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, as specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Company and the Guarantor will use their best efforts to obtain the listing of such issue of Euro Medium-Term Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, to furnish to such exchange all documents, information and undertakings that may be reasonably necessary in order to effect such listing, and to cause such listing to be continued so long as any of the Euro Medium-Term Notes of such issue remain outstanding. (B) Each Agent represents to and agrees with the Company and the Guarantor that: (a) Except to the extent permitted under U.S. Treas. Reg. Section 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D) (the "D Rules"), (i) it has not offered or sold, and during the restricted period will not offer or sell, Euro Medium-Term Notes to a person who is within the United States or its possessions or to a United States person, and (ii) it has not delivered and will not deliver within 14
the United States or its possessions definitive Euro Medium-Term Notes that are sold during the restricted period. (b) It has and throughout the restricted period will have in effect procedures reasonably designed to ensure that its employees or agents who are directly engaged in selling Euro Medium-Term Notes are aware that such Euro Medium-Term Notes may not be offered or sold during the restricted period to a person who is within the United States or its possessions or to a United States person, except as permitted by the D Rules. (c) If it is a United States person, it represents that it is acquiring the Euro Medium-Term Notes for purposes of resale in connection with their original issuance, and if it retains Euro Medium-Term Notes for its own account, it will only do so in accordance with the requirements of U.S. Treas. Reg. Section 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(6). (d) With respect to each of its affiliates that acquires Euro Medium-Term Notes from it for the purpose of offering or selling such Euro Medium-Term Notes during the restricted period, it repeats and confirms the representations and agreements contained in Sections 4(B)(a), (b) and (c) on such affiliate's behalf. (e) It has not entered and will not enter into any contractual arrangement with respect to the distribution or delivery of Euro Medium-Term Notes, except with their affiliates or with the prior written consent of the Company and the Guarantor. Terms used in this Section 4(B) have the meanings given to them by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder, including the D Rules. For these purposes, the "restricted period" with respect to a Euro Medium-Term Note generally ends upon the expiration of the 40-day period beginning on the issue date of such Euro Medium-Term Note, unless the International Agent holds such Euro Medium-Term Note as part of an unsold allotment or subscription, in which case the "restricted period" continues for so long as the International Agent holds such Euro Medium-Term Note. (f) It in relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a "Relevant Member State"), with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State ("Relevant Implementation Date"), it has not made and will not make an offer of Notes to the public in that Relevant Member State prior to the publication of a prospectus in relation to the Notes which has been approved by the competent authority in that Relevant Member State or, where appropriate, approved in another Relevant Member State and notified to the competent authority in that Relevant Member State, all in accordance with the Prospectus Directive, except that it may, with effect from and including the Relevant Implementation Date, make an offer of Notes to the public in that Relevant Member State at any time: (1) to legal entities which are authorized or regulated to operate in the financial markets or, if not so authorized or regulated, whose corporate purpose is solely to invest in securities; 15
(2) to any legal entity which has two or more of (1) an average of at least 250 employees during the last financial year; (2) a total balance sheet of more than E43,000,000 and (3) an annual net turnover of more than E50,000,000, as shown in its last annual or consolidated accounts; or (3) in any other circumstances which do not require the publication by the issuer of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive. For the purposes of this provision, the expression an "offer of Notes to the public" in relation to any Notes in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State. (g) It has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the "FSMA")) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Company or the Guarantor. (h) It has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom. (i) It and each of its affiliates have not offered or sold, and will not offer or sell, the Notes by means of any document to persons in Hong Kong other than persons whose ordinary business is to buy or sell shares or debentures, whether as principal or agent or otherwise in circumstances which do not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Chapter 32 of the Laws of Hong Kong), and unless permitted to do so under the securities laws of Hong Kong, no person has issued or had in its possession for the purposes of issue, and will not issue or have in its possession for the purpose of issue, any advertisement, document or invitation relating to the Notes other than with respect to the Notes to be disposed of to persons outside Hong Kong or only to persons whose business involves the acquisition, disposal or holding of securities, whether as principal or agent. (j) It will not offer or sell any Notes directly or indirectly in Japan or to, or for the benefit of, any Japanese person or to others, for re-offering or re-sale directly or indirectly in Japan or to any Japanese person except under circumstances which will result in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and guidelines promulgated by the relevant governmental and regulatory authorities in effect at the relevant time. For purposes of this paragraph, "Japanese person" means any person resident in Japan, including any corporation or other entity organized under the laws of Japan. (k) It is aware of the fact that no securities prospectus (Wertpapierprospekt) under the German Securities Prospectus Act (Wertpapierprospektgesetz, the "Prospectus Act") has been or will be published in respect of the Notes in the Federal Public of Germany and that it 16
will comply with the Prospectus Act and all other laws and regulations applicable in the Federal Republic of Germany governing the issue, offering and sale of the Notes. (l) No Notes have been offered or sold and will be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, to the public in France except to qualified investors (investisseurs qualifies) and/or to a limited circle of investors (cercle restreint d'investisseurs) acting for their own account as defined in article L. 411-2 of the French Code Monetaire et Financier and applicable regulations thereunder; and that the direct or indirect resale to the public in France of any Notes acquired by any qualified investors (investisseurs qualifies) and/or any investors belonging to a limited circle of investors (cercle restreint d'investisseurs) may be made only as provided by articles L. 412-1 and L. 621-8 of the French Code of Monetaire et Financier and applicable regulations thereunder; and that none of the pricing supplement, the prospectus supplement, the prospectus or any other offering materials relating to the Notes has been released, issued or distributed to the public in France except to qualified investors (investisseurs qualifies) and/or to a limited circle of investors (circle restreint d'investisseurs) mentioned above.. 5. Conditions to the Obligations of the Agents. Each Agent's obligations to solicit offers to purchase Notes as agent of the Company, any Agent's obligation to purchase Notes as principal pursuant to any Terms Agreement or otherwise, and the obligation of any other Agent to purchase Notes from the Company will be subject to the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company and the Guarantor herein contained, to the accuracy of the statements of the officers of the Company and the Guarantor made in each certificate furnished pursuant to the provisions hereof and to the performance and observance by the Company and the Guarantor of all covenants and agreements herein contained on their part to be performed and observed (in the case of either Agent's obligations to solicit offers to purchase Notes, at the time of such solicitation, and, in the case of any Purchaser's obligation to purchase Notes, at the time the Company accepts the offer to purchase such Notes and at the time of purchase) and (in each case) to the following additional conditions precedent when and as specified: (a) On the corresponding Settlement Date: (i) The Prospectuses, and any supplements thereto, have been filed in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b) and any other material required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d), shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433; and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or threatened. (ii) There shall not have occurred any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company, the Guarantor and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectuses and any Pricing Supplements (exclusive of any supplement thereto) the 17
effect of which, in any case referred to above, is, in the sole judgment of the Agents after consultation with the Company, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Notes as contemplated by the relevant Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, except, in the case of any purchase of Notes by either Agent as principal, as disclosed to such Agent in writing by the Company and the Guarantor before the Company accepted the offer to purchase such Notes. (iii) (A) With respect to the Medium-Term Notes: There shall not have occurred any (x) suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange, or any suspension of trading of the Guarantor's common stock by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, (y) declaration of a general moratorium on commercial banking activities by either federal or New York state authorities or exchange controls shall have been imposed by the United States or (z) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, any declaration by the United States of war or national emergency or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such to as to make it, in the Agent's sole judgment, after consultation with the Company, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering of the Notes as contemplated by the relevant Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, except, in the case of any purchase of Notes by either Agent as principal, for any such event occurring before the Company accepted the offer to purchase such Notes. (iv) With respect to the Euro Medium-Term Notes: There shall not have occurred any (x) suspension or material limitation of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange or Luxembourg Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange, or any suspension of trading of the Guarantor's common stock by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or any suspension of trading of any securities of the Company or the Guarantor on any foreign exchange, (y) declaration of a general moratorium on commercial banking activities by either federal or New York state authorities or by bank regulatory authorities in London or Luxembourg, or exchange controls shall have been imposed by the United States or by any country the currency of which will be used to make any payment in respect of the Notes or (z) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, any declaration by the United States or the United Kingdom of war or national emergency or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such to as to make it, in the Agent's sole judgment, after consultation with the Company, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering of the Notes as contemplated by the relevant Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, except, in the case of any purchase of Notes by either Agent as principal, for any such event occurring before the Company accepted the offer to purchase such Notes. (v) There shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's or the Guarantor's senior or subordinated debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g)) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change, 18
except as disclosed to the Agents in writing by the Company and the Guarantor before the Company accepted the offer to purchase such Notes. (b) On the Commencement Date and, if called for by any agreement by either Agent to purchase Notes as principal, on the corresponding Settlement Date: (i) The Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to each Agent the opinion of the General Counsel, Finance and Capital Markets of the Guarantor (or other counsel for the Company and/or the Guarantor reasonably acceptable to the Agents) on the Commencement Date, and, on the Settlement Date will furnish the opinion of the General Counsel, Finance and Capital Markets of the Guarantor (or other counsel for the Company and/or the Guarantor reasonably acceptable to the Agents) and, if called for by a Terms Agreement, the opinion of other counsel, dated the Commencement Date or the Settlement Date, as the case may be, to the effect set forth in Exhibit H hereto. (ii) Each Agent shall have received from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, counsel for the Agents (or other counsel reasonably acceptable to such Agent, the Company and the Guarantor), an opinion dated the Commencement Date or the Settlement Date, as the case may be, to the effect set forth in Exhibit I hereto. (iii) The Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to the Agents a certificate of the Company and the Guarantor, signed by (A) on behalf of the Company--the Chairman, the President or any Vice President and by the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer, the Controller, the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary and (B) on behalf of the Guarantor--the Chairman, any Vice Chairman, the President, any Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Accounting Officer, the General Counsel, the Controller or any Deputy Controller and by the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer, the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary (or another officer or officers acceptable to the Agents), dated the Commencement Date or the Settlement Date, as the case may be, to the effect that each signatory of such certificate has carefully examined the Registration Statement, as amended as of the date of such certificate, the Prospectuses, as amended and supplemented as of the date of such certificate, the Disclosure Package and this Agreement and that: (A) the respective representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the date of such certificate with the same effect as if made on the date of such certificate and the Company and the Guarantor have complied in all material respects with all the respective agreements and satisfied all the conditions on their part to be performed or satisfied as a condition to the obligations of the Agents under this Agreement; (B) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to their knowledge, have been threatened 19
or communicated by the Commission to the Company or the Guarantor as being contemplated by it under the Securities Act; and (C) since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the relevant Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, each as amended and supplemented, there has been no material adverse change in the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which is not disclosed in the relevant Prospectus or the Disclosure Package, as amended or supplemented. (iv) KPMG LLP or another nationally recognized independent registered public accounting firm shall have furnished to the Agents a letter or letters, dated the Commencement Date or the Settlement Date, as the case may be, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agents, to the effect set forth in Exhibit J and Exhibit K hereto. (v) The Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to each Agent such appropriate further information, certificates and documents as such Agent may reasonably request. The documents required to be delivered by this Section 5 shall be delivered at the office of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, counsel for the Agents, at One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York 10006, on the Commencement Date or the Settlement Date, as the case may be. 6. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company and the Guarantor agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Agent and each person who controls any Agent within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Notes as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any prospectus supplement, any preliminary or final Pricing Supplement or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company and the Guarantor will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by any Agent specifically for inclusion 20
therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Guarantor may otherwise have. (b) Each Agent severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to each Agent, but only with reference to written information relating to such Agent furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by such Agent specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that either Agent may otherwise have. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. 21
(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the Guarantor and the Agents severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company, the Guarantor and one or more of the Agents may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and by the Agents on the other from the offering of the Notes; provided, however, that in no case shall (i) any Agent (except as may be provided in any agreement among Agents relating to the offering of the Notes) be responsible for any amount in excess of the discount or commission applicable to the Notes purchased by such Agent hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the Guarantor and the Agents severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and benefits received by the Agents shall be deemed to be equal to the total discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth in the Pricing Supplement. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand or the Agents on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantor and the Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

EXHIBIT A CITIGROUP FUNDING INC. Medium-Term Notes, Series D and Series E, Administrative Procedures April 20, 2006 The Medium-Term Notes, Series D (the "Series D Notes") and Medium-Term Notes, Series E (the "Series E Notes," and, together with the Series D Notes, the "Notes") of Citigroup Funding Inc. (the "Company"), any payments due on which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by (the "Guarantee") Citigroup Inc. (the "Guarantor"), are to be offered on a continuing basis. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. has agreed, as agent, to solicit purchases of Notes issued in fully registered form. (The term "Agent" when used in these Administrative Procedures, means Citigroup Global Markets Inc.) The Agent will not be obligated to purchase Notes for its own account. The Notes are being sold pursuant to a Global Selling Agency Agreement among the Company, the Guarantor, and the agents named therein (including the Agent) dated the date hereof (the "Agency Agreement"). The Notes have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"). JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is the trustee under the Indenture, dated as of June 1, 2005, under which the Series D Notes will be issued (the "Senior Debt Indenture"). Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is the trustee (together with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the "Trustees") under the Indenture, dated as of June 1, 2005, under which the Series E Notes will be issued (the "Subordinated Debt Indenture," and, together with the Senior Debt Indenture, the "Indentures"). The Series D Notes will constitute part of the senior debt of the Company and will rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of the Company. The Guarantee of the Series D Notes will constitute part of the senior debt of the Guarantor and will rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of the Guarantor. The Series E Notes will be subordinate and junior in the right of payment to all Citigroup Funding Senior Indebtedness, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Subordinated Debt Indenture. The Guarantee of the Series E Notes will be subordinate and junior in the right of payment to all Citigroup Senior Indebtedness, to the extent and in the manner set forth in the Subordinated Debt Indenture. The Agency Agreement provides that Notes may also be purchased by the Agent acting solely as principal and not as agent. In the event of any such purchase, the functions of both the Agent and the beneficial owner under the administrative procedures set forth below shall be performed by the Agent acting solely as principal, unless otherwise agreed to between the Company, the Guarantor and the Agent acting as principal. Each Note will be represented by either a Global Security (as defined hereinafter) or a certificate delivered to the Holder thereof or a Person designated by such Holder (a "Certificated Note"). Each Global Security representing Series D Notes will be delivered to Citibank, N.A., and each Global Security representing Series E Notes will be delivered to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, each acting as agent for The Depository Trust Company or any successor depositary selected by the Company ("DTC", which term, as used herein, includes any successor depositary selected by the Company), and will be recorded in the A-1
book-entry system maintained by DTC (a "Book-Entry Note"). An owner of a Book-Entry Note will not be entitled to receive a certificate representing such Note. The procedures to be followed during, and the specific terms of, the solicitation of orders by the Agent and the sale as a result thereof by the Company are explained below. Administrative and record-keeping responsibilities will be handled for the Company by its Treasury Department. The Company will advise the Agent and the Trustees in writing of those persons handling administrative responsibilities with whom the Agent and the Trustees are to communicate regarding orders to purchase Notes and the details of their delivery. The term "Trustees" as used in these procedures means the Trustees and any other agents appointed by the Trustees or the Company. Administrative procedures and specific terms of the offering are explained below. Book-Entry Notes will be issued in accordance with the administrative procedures set forth in Part I hereof, as adjusted in accordance with changes in DTC's operating requirements, and Certificated Notes will be issued in accordance with the administrative procedures set forth in Part II hereof. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Indentures, the Agency Agreement, the Notes or the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Notes shall be used herein as therein defined. Notes for which interest is calculated on the basis of a fixed interest rate, which may be zero, are referred to herein as "Fixed Rate Notes". Notes for which interest is calculated on the basis of a floating interest rate are referred to herein as "Floating Rate Notes". To the extent the procedures set forth below conflict with the provisions of the Notes, the Indentures, DTC's operating requirements or the Agency Agreement, the relevant provisions of the Notes, the Indentures, DTC's operating requirements and the Agency Agreement shall control. PART I Administrative Procedures for Book-Entry Notes In connection with the qualification of the Book-Entry Notes for eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by DTC, Citibank, N.A. and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (together, the "DTC Agents") will perform the custodial, document control and administrative functions described below for the Series D Notes and the Series E Notes, respectively. Citibank, N.A. will perform such functions in accordance with its respective obligations under a Letter of Representations from the Company and Citibank, N.A. to DTC dated as of the date hereof and a Medium-Term Note Certificate Agreement between Citibank, N.A. and DTC, dated as of October 31, 1988 and as amended to date, and its obligations as a participant in DTC, including DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlement system ("SDFS"). Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas will perform such functions in accordance with its respective obligations under a Letter of Representations from the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas to DTC to be executed on a future date and a Certificate Agreement between DTC and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, dated as of December 5, 1997 and as amended to date, and its obligations as a participant in DTC, including DTC's SDFS. A-2
Issuance: On any date of settlement (as defined under "Settlement" below) for one or more Book-Entry Notes, the Company will issue a single global security in fully registered form without coupons (a "Global Security") representing up to U.S $500,000,000 principal amount of all such Book-Entry Notes of the same Series that have the same Original Issue Date, Original Issue Discount provisions, if any, Interest Payment Dates, Regular Record Dates, Interest Payment Period, redemption repayment and extension provisions, if any, Stated Maturity, and, in the case of Fixed Rate Notes, interest rate, and amortization schedule, if any, or, in the case of Floating Rate Notes, Initial Interest Rate, Base Rate, Index Maturity, Interest Reset Period, Interest Reset Dates, Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, Minimum Interest Rate, if any, and Maximum Interest Rate, if any and, in each case, any other relevant terms (collectively, the "Terms"). Each Global Security will be dated and issued as of the date of its settlement. Each Global Security will bear an Original Issue Date, which will be (i) with respect to an original Global Security (or any portion thereof), the Original Issue Date specified in such Global Security and (ii) following a consolidation of Global Securities, with respect to the Global Security resulting from such consolidation, the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for on the predecessor Global Securities, regardless of the date of authentication of such resulting Global Security. No Global Security will represent (i) both Fixed Rate and Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes, (ii) any Certificated Note, or (iii) both Series D Notes and Series E Notes. Identification Numbers: The Company has arranged with the CUSIP Service Bureau of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (the "CUSIP Service Bureau") for the reservation of two Series of CUSIP numbers, one for Series D Notes and one for Series E Notes, each of which series consists of approximately 900 CUSIP numbers and relates to Global Securities representing Book-Entry Notes and book-entry medium-term notes issued by the Company with other Series designations. The DTC Agents, the Company and DTC have obtained from the CUSIP Service Bureau a written list of such reserved CUSIP numbers. The DTC Agents will assign CUSIP numbers to Global Securities as described below under Settlement Procedure "B". DTC will notify the CUSIP Service Bureau periodically of the CUSIP numbers that the DTC Agents have assigned to Global Securities. Each DTC Agent will notify the Company at any time when fewer than 100 of the reserved CUSIP numbers remain unassigned to Global Securities, and, if it deems necessary, the Company will reserve additional CUSIP numbers for assignment to Global Securities. Upon obtaining such additional CUSIP numbers, the Company shall deliver a list of such additional CUSIP numbers to either or both DTC Agents, as needed, and to DTC.
A-3
Registration: Global Securities will be issued only in fully registered form without coupons. Each Global Security will be registered in the name of CEDE & CO., as nominee for DTC, on the securities register for the Notes (the "Securities Register") maintained under the Indentures. The beneficial owner of a Book-Entry Note (or one or more indirect participants in DTC designated by such owner) will designate one or more participants in DTC (with respect to such Book-Entry Note, the "Participants") to act as agent or agents for such owner in connection with the book-entry system maintained by DTC, and DTC will record in book-entry form, in accordance with instructions provided by such Participants, a credit balance with respect to such beneficial owner in such Book-Entry Note in the account of such Participants. The ownership interest of such beneficial owner (or such participant) in such Book-Entry Note will be recorded through the records of such Participants or through the separate records of such Participants and one or more indirect participants in DTC. Transfers: Transfers of a Book-Entry Note will be accomplished by book entries made by DTC and, in turn, by Participants (and in certain cases, one or more indirect participants in DTC) acting on behalf of beneficial transferors and transferees of such Note. Exchanges: Each DTC Agent may deliver to DTC and the CUSIP Service Bureau at any time a written notice of consolidation (a copy of which shall be attached to the resulting Global Security described below) specifying (i) the CUSIP numbers of two or more outstanding Global Securities that represent (A) Fixed Rate Book-Entry Notes of the same Series Dnd having the same Terms and for which interest has been paid to the same date or (B) Floating Rate Book-Entry Notes of the same Series Dnd having the same Terms and for which interest has been paid to the same date, (ii) a date, occurring at least thirty days after such written notice is delivered and at least thirty days before the next Interest Payment Date for such Book-Entry Notes, on which such Global Securities shall be exchanged for a single replacement Global Security and (iii) a new CUSIP number to be assigned to such replacement Global Security. Upon receipt of such a notice, DTC will send to its participants (including the DTC Agent for such replacement Global Security) a written reorganization notice to the effect that such exchange will occur on such date. Prior to the specified exchange date, such DTC Agent will deliver to the CUSIP Service Bureau a written notice setting forth such exchange date and such new CUSIP number and stating that, as of such exchange date, the CUSIP numbers of the Global Securities to be exchanged will no longer be valid. On the specified exchange date, such DTC Agent will exchange such Global Securities for a single Global Security bearing the new CUSIP number and a new Original Issue Date, which shall be the last date to which interest has been paid on the underlying
A-4
Book-Entry Notes, and the CUSIP numbers of the exchanged Global Securities will, in accordance with CUSIP Service Bureau procedures, be canceled and not immediately reassigned. Upon such exchange, the DTC Agent will mark the predecessor Global Security "canceled", make appropriate entries in the DTC Agent's records and destroy such canceled Global Security in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and deliver a certificate of destruction to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Global Securities to be exchanged exceed U.S $500,000,000 in aggregate principal amount, one Global Security will be authenticated and issued to represent each U.S. $500,000,000 of principal amount of the exchanged Global Securities and an additional Global Security will be authenticated and issued to represent any remaining principal amount of such Global Securities (see "Denominations" below). Maturities: Each Book-Entry Note will mature on a date nine months or more after the issue date for such Note, except in the case of indexed Notes, for which the maturity may be shorter. A Floating Rate Book-Entry Note will mature only on an Interest Payment Date for such Note. Any Note denominated in Japanese yen will mature on a date not less than one year from the Original Issue Date (as defined below) for such Note. Any Note denominated in Pounds Sterling will mature on a date not less than one year, nor more than five years, after its Original Issue Date. Denominations: Unless otherwise agreed to by the Company, Book-Entry Notes will be issued in principal amounts of U.S.$1,000 or any amount in excess thereof that is an integral multiple of U.S.$1,000. If Book-Entry Notes are denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars, the denominations of such Notes will be determined pursuant to the provisions of the applicable Pricing Supplement. Global Securities will be denominated in principal amounts not in excess of U.S.$500,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof). If one or more Book-Entry Notes having an aggregate principal amount in excess of U.S.$500,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof) would, but for the preceding sentence, be represented by a single Global Security, then one Global Security will be authenticated and issued to represent each U.S.$500,000,000 principal amount (or the equivalent thereof) of such Book-Entry Note or Notes and an additional Global Security will be authenticated and issued to represent any remaining principal amount of such Book-Entry Note or Notes. In such a case, each of the Global Securities representing such Book-Entry Note or Notes shall be assigned the same CUSIP number.
A-5
Notice of Redemption Dates: Each DTC Agent will, with respect to the Notes for which it is Trustee, give notice to DTC prior to each Redemption Date (as specified in the Note) if any at the time and in the manner set forth in the Letter. Interest: General. Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable Pricing Supplement, interest, if any, on each Book-Entry Note will accrue from the Original Issue Date (or such other date on which interest otherwise begins to accrue, if different than the Original Issue Date) of the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Note for the first interest period or the last date to which interest has been paid, if any, for each subsequent interest period, on the Global Security representing such Book-Entry Note, and will be calculated and paid in the manner and on the Interest Payment Dates described in such Book-Entry Note and in the Prospectus (as defined in the Agency Agreement), as supplemented by the applicable Pricing Supplement. Each payment of interest on a Book-Entry Note will include interest accrued to but excluding the Interest Payment Date; provided that in the case of Floating Rate Notes that reset daily or weekly, interest payments will include interest accrued to but excluding the next preceding Regular Record Date, except that at stated Maturity, the interest payable will include interest accrued to, but excluding, the Maturity. Interest payable at the Maturity of a Book-Entry Note will be payable to the Person to whom the principal of such Note is payable. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services will use the information received in the pending deposit message described under Settlement Procedure "C" below in order to include the amount of any interest payable and certain other information regarding the related Global Security in the appropriate (daily or weekly) bond report published by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. Regular Record Dates. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Pricing Supplement, the Regular Record Date with respect to any Interest Payment Date for a Floating-Rate Note, Fixed Rate Note or Indexed Rate Note shall be the date (whether or not a Business Day) fifteen calendar days immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date.

A-6
Payment Date by reference to the appropriate (daily or weekly) bond reports published by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. The Company will pay to the Trustee for the Notes represented by such Global Security the total amount of interest due on such Interest Payment Date (other than at Maturity), and such Trustee will pay such amount to DTC at the times and in the manner set forth below under "Manner of Payment". If any Interest Payment Date for a Book-Entry Note is not a Business Day, the payment due on such day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no interest shall accrue as a result of such delayed payment. Payments at Maturity or Upon Redemption. On or about the first Business Day of each month, each DTC Agent will, with respect to the Global Securities for which it acts as DTC Agent, deliver to the Company, DTC and the applicable Trustee a written list of principal and interest to be paid on each Global Security maturing either at Maturity or on a Redemption Date in the following month. The DTC Agent for each Global Security, the Company and DTC will confirm the amounts of such principal and interest payments with respect to each such Global Security on or about the fifth Business Day preceding the Maturity Date or Redemption Date of such Global Security. On or before such Maturity or Redemption, the Company will pay to the Trustee for the Notes represented by such Global Security the principal amount of such Global Security, together with interest due at such Maturity. Such Trustee will pay such amount to DTC at the times and in the manner set forth below under "Manner of Payment". If any Maturity of a Global Security representing Book-Entry Notes is not a Business Day, the payment due on such day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no interest shall accrue on such payment for the period from and after such Maturity Date or Redemption Date. Promptly after payment to DTC of the principal and interest due on the Maturity Date or on the Redemption Date of such Global Security, the Trustee for such Global Security will cancel and destroy such Global Security in accordance with the applicable Indenture and deliver a certificate of destruction to the Company. Manner of Payment. The total amount of any principal and interest due on Global Securities on any Interest Payment Date or at Maturity or upon redemption shall be paid by the Company to the Trustee for the Notes represented by such Global Security in immediately available funds no later than 9:30 A.M. (New York City time) on such date. The Company will make such payment on such Global Securities by instructing such Trustee to withdraw funds from an account maintained by the Company with the DTC Agent for the Notes represented by such Global Securities. The Company will confirm any such instructions in writing to such Trustee. Prior to
A-7
10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the Maturity Date or as soon as possible thereafter, such Trustee will pay by separate wire transfer (using Fedwire message entry instructions in a form previously specified by DTC) to an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York previously specified by DTC, in funds available for immediate use by DTC, each payment of principal (together with interest thereon) due on a Global Security on such Maturity Date or Redemption Date. On each Interest Payment Date (other than at Maturity), interest payments shall be made to DTC, in same day funds, in accordance with existing arrangements between the relevant DTC Agent and DTC. On each such date, DTC will pay, in accordance with its SDFS operating procedures then in effect, such amounts in funds available for immediate use to the respective Participants in whose names the Book-Entry Notes represented by such Global Securities are recorded in the book-entry system maintained by DTC. None of the Company (as issuer or as paying agent), the Guarantor, the Trustee or such DTC Agent shall have any direct responsibility or liability for the payment by DTC to such Participants of the principal of and interest on the Book-Entry Notes. If an issue of Notes is denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, the Company will make payments of principal and any interest in the currency in which the Notes are denominated (the "foreign currency") or in U.S. dollars. DTC has elected to have all such payments of principal and interest in U.S. dollars unless notified by any of its Participants through which an interest in the Notes is held that it elects, in accordance with and to the extent permitted by the applicable Pricing Supplement and the Note, to receive such payment of principal or interest in the foreign currency. On or prior to the third Business Day after the record date for payment of interest and twelve days prior to the date for payment of principal, such Participant shall notify DTC of (i) its election to receive all, or the specified portion, of such payment in the foreign currency and (ii) its instructions for wire transfer of such payment to a foreign currency account. DTC will notify the applicable Trustee on or prior to the fifth
A-8
business day after the record date for payment of interest and ten days prior to the date for payment of principal of the portion of such payment to be received in the foreign currency and the applicable wire transfer instructions, and the applicable Trustee shall use such instructions to pay the Participants directly. If DTC does not so notify the applicable Trustee, it is understood that only U.S. dollar payments are to be made. The applicable Trustee shall notify DTC on or prior to the second Business Day prior to payment date of the conversion rate to be used and the resulting U.S. dollar amount to be paid per U.S.$1,000 face amount. In the event that the applicable Trustee's quotation to convert the foreign currency into U.S. dollars is not available, the applicable Trustee shall notify DTC's Dividend Department that the entire payment is to be made in the foreign currency. In such event, DTC will ask its Participants for payment instructions and forward such instructions to the applicable Trustee and the applicable Trustee shall use such instructions to pay the Participants directly. Withholding Taxes. The amount of any taxes required under applicable law to be withheld from any interest payment on a Book-Entry Note will be determined and withheld by the Participant, indirect participant in DTC or other Person responsible for forwarding payments and materials directly to the beneficial owner of such Note.
