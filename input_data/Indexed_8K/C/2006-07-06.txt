Incorporated UBS Securities LLC Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC Banc of America Securities LLC Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. Lehman Brothers Inc. RBC Dain Rauscher Inc., as Representatives of the several Underwriters c/o Citigroup Global Markets Inc. 388 Greenwich Street New York, New York 10013 Ladies and Gentlemen: Citigroup Capital XIV (the "Trust"), a statutory trust organized under the Statutory Trust Act (the "Delaware Act") of the State of Delaware (Chapter 38, Title 12, of the Delaware Business Code, 12 Del. C. Section 3801 et seq.), proposes, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, to issue and sell 20,000,000 6.875% Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities (Enhanced TRUPS(R)) with an aggregate liquidation amount equal to $500,000,000 (the "Underwritten Securities") to the several Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you (the "Representatives") are acting as representatives. The Trust also proposes to grant the Underwriters an option to purchase 3,000,000 additional 6.875% Enhanced Trust 1
Preferred Securities (Enhanced TRUPS(R)) to cover over-allotments (the "Option Securities" and, together with the Underwritten Securities, the "Capital Securities"). The Capital Securities and the Common Securities (as defined herein) are to be issued pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated declaration of trust, dated as of June 26, 2006 (the "Declaration"), among Citigroup Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company" and, together with the Trust, the "Offerors"), as sponsor, the trustees named therein (the "Citigroup Capital Trustees") and the holders from time to time of undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. The Declaration is qualified as an indenture under the Trust Indenture Act. Pursuant to the Declaration, the number of Citigroup Capital Trustees will initially be five. Three of the Citigroup Capital Trustees (the "Regular Trustees") will be persons who are employees or officers of the Company. The fourth Citigroup Capital Trustee will be a financial institution unaffiliated with the Company that will serve as property trustee under the Declaration and as indenture trustee with respect to the Capital Securities for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act (the "Institutional Trustee"). The fifth Citigroup Capital Trustee will be a financial institution or an affiliate thereof which maintains a principal place of business in the State of Delaware, meeting the requirements of the Delaware Act (the "Delaware Trustee"). Initially, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., a New York banking association ("JPMorgan Chase"), will act as the Institutional Trustee and Chase Manhattan Bank USA, N.A., a banking association with its principal place of business in the State of Delaware, will act as the Delaware Trustee until removed or replaced by the holder of the Common Securities. The Capital Securities will be guaranteed by the Company on a subordinated basis with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption or otherwise (the "Guarantee") pursuant to the Capital Securities Guarantee Agreement dated as of June 30, 2006 (the "Guarantee Agreement") between the Company and JPMorgan Chase, as Trustee (the "Guarantee Trustee"). The assets of the Trust will consist of 6.875% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due June 30, 2066 (the "Subordinated Debentures") of the Company which will be issued under an indenture, dated as of June 30, 2006 (as supplemented, the "Indenture"), between the Company and JPMorgan Chase, as Trustee (the "Indenture Trustee"). Under certain circumstances, the Subordinated Debentures will be distributable to the holders of undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. The Capital Securities, the Guarantee and the Subordinated Debentures are referred to herein as the "Securities." The Offerors wish to confirm as follows their agreement with you and the other several Underwriters listed on Schedule I on whose behalf you are acting, in connection with the several purchases of the Capital Securities by the Underwriters. To the extent there are no additional Underwriters listed on Schedule I other than you, the term Representatives as used herein shall mean you, as Underwriters, and the terms Representatives and Underwriters shall mean either the singular or plural as the context requires. Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Exchange Act on or before the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus 2
shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference. Certain terms used herein are defined in Section 21 hereof. 1. Registration Statement and Prospectus. The Offerors meet the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Act and have prepared and filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement, as defined in Rule 405 (File No. 333-135163), including a related form of prospectus, for registration under the Act of the offering and sale of the Securities. Such Registration Statement, including any amendments thereto filed prior to the date hereof, became effective upon filing. The Offerors may have filed with the Commission, as part of an amendment to the Registration Statement or pursuant to Rule 424(b), one or more preliminary prospectuses relating to the Securities, each of which has previously been furnished to you. The Company will file with the Commission a final prospectus relating to the Securities in accordance with Rule 424(b). As filed, such final prospectus shall contain all information required by the Act and the rules thereunder, and, except to the extent the Representatives shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to you prior to the date hereof or, to the extent not completed by the date hereof, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in any preliminary prospectus) as the Company has advised you, prior to the date hereof, will be included or made therein. The Registration Statement, as of the date hereof, meets the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x). The initial Effective Date of the Registration Statement was not earlier than the date three years before the date hereof. 2. Agreements to Sell and Purchase. (a) The Trust hereby agrees, subject to all the terms and conditions set forth herein, to issue and sell to each Underwriter and, upon the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Offerors herein contained and subject to all the terms and conditions set forth herein each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Trust, at a purchase price of $25 per Capital Security, the number of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto (or such number of Capital Securities increased as set forth in Section 10 hereof). The Company agrees that, in view of the fact that the proceeds of the sale of the Underwritten Securities will be invested in the Subordinated Debentures, it shall pay to the Underwriters as compensation ("Underwriters' Compensation") for their arranging the investment of the proceeds therein, on the Closing Date (as defined herein), $0.7875 per Underwritten Security. Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Trust hereby grants an option to the several Underwriters to purchase, severally and not jointly, up to 3,000,000 Option Securities at the same purchase price per share as the Underwriters shall pay for the Underwritten Securities. Said option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time (but not more than once) on or before the 30th day after the date of the initial public offering, upon written or facsimile notice by the Representatives to the Trust setting forth the number of Option Securities as to which the several Underwriters are exercising the option and the date on which delivery and payment shall occur, which shall not be 3
less than three Business Days after the date of the notice of exercise. The number of Option Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be the same percentage of the total number of Option Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters as such Underwriter is purchasing of the Underwritten Securities, subject to such adjustments as the Representatives, in their absolute discretion, shall make to eliminate any fractional shares. 3. Terms of Public Offering. The Offerors have been advised by you that the Underwriters propose to make a public offering of their respective portions of the Capital Securities as soon as the Underwriters deem advisable after this Agreement has been executed and delivered, and the Declaration, the Guarantee Agreement and the Indenture have been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act. The entire proceeds from the sale of the Capital Securities will be combined with the entire proceeds from the sale by the Trust to the Company of its common securities (the "Common Securities"), and will be used by the Trust to purchase an equivalent amount of the Subordinated Debentures. 4. Delivery of the Capital Securities and Payment Therefore. Delivery to the Underwriters of, and payment for, the Capital Securities shall be made at the office of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York 10006, at 8:30 A.M., New York City time, on June 30, 2006 (the "Closing Date").

It is understood that the Representatives, acting individually and not in a representative capacity, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment to the Company on behalf of any other Underwriter for Capital Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter. Any such payment by the Representatives shall not relieve any such Underwriter of any of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall pay to the Representatives on the Closing Date for the accounts of the Underwriters any fee, commission or other compensation specified herein.

(b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Company, the Trust, the Company's directors, the Company's officers and the Regular Trustees who sign the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Trust to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Offerors by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Offerors acknowledge that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Capital Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Capital Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); 12
provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the Trust and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company, the Trust and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Trust on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Capital Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall (i) any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Capital Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Capital Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the Trust and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Trust on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and the Trust shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Trust, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the 13
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company and the Trust on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Trust and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company, as applicable, within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company and the Regular Trustees who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Trust, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). 8. Conditions of the Underwriters' Obligations. The obligations of the several Underwriters to purchase the Capital Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Offerors contained herein as of the date hereof and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Offerors made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by each of the Offerors of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions: (a) The Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, have been filed in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); the Final Term Sheet contemplated by Section 5(b) hereto, and any other material required to be filed by the Offerors pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433; and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any notice objecting to its use shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or threatened.

(j) Subsequent to the date hereof, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of the Capital Securities or any of the Company's senior or subordinated debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.

Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of the Capital Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Offerors set forth in Section 8 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 11 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Offerors to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representatives on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Capital Securities. 11. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Capital Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Capital Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Capital Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Capital Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Capital Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Capital Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Capital Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Capital Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Offerors.

Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Trust, the Company or its officers or trustees and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Trust or the Company or any of the officers, directors, trustees, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

Section 1.5. Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Company. Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with, (1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Institutional Trust Group; provided, however, that such instrument will be considered properly given if submitted in an electronic format, i.e., by facsimile, E-Mail or otherwise, or (2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Company addressed to it at the address of its principal office specified in the first paragraph of this instrument or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company; provided, however, that such instrument will be considered properly given if submitted in an electronic format, i.e., by facsimile, E-Mail or otherwise. Section 1.6. Notice to Holders; Waiver.

earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken-in reliance upon such waiver. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.

remedies shall be governed by such laws without regard for the principles of its conflicts of laws. Section 1.13. Legal Holidays. In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity of any Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Securities) payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date, or at the Stated Maturity, provided that no interest shall accrue for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be, except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date. Section 1.14. Tax Characterization.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be executed. Dated: ____________ CITIGROUP INC. By: ------------------------------------ Name: ---------------------------------- Title: --------------------------------- By: ------------------------------------ Name: ---------------------------------- Title: --------------------------------- Section 2.3. Form of Reverse of Security. This Security is one of a duly authorized series of securities of the Company (herein sometimes referred to as the "Securities"), specified in the Indenture, all issued or to be issued in one or more series under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of June __, 2006 (the "Indenture"), duly executed and delivered between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of 18
the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Securities. By the terms of the Indenture, the Securities are issuable in series that may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as provided in the Indenture. This series of Securities is limited in aggregate principal amount to $________(, plus up to an additional $________ aggregate principal amount which may be issued upon exercise of the over-allotment option contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement). The Company shall have the right to redeem this Security at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time on or after June __, 2011 (an "Optional Redemption"), or any time in certain circumstances upon the occurrence of a Tax Event, an Investment Company Event or a Regulatory Capital Event (as defined in the Company's Prospectus dated June __, 2006) (each, a "Special Event") at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such redemption (the "Optional Redemption Price"). Any redemption pursuant to this paragraph will be made upon not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days notice, or with respect to a redemption upon a Special Event, within 90 days following the occurrence of such Special Event, at the Optional Redemption Price. If the Securities are only partially redeemed by the Company pursuant to an Optional Redemption, the Securities will be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by any other method utilized by the Trustee; provided that if, at the time of redemption, the Securities are registered as a Global Security, the Depositary (as defined herein) shall determine the principal amount of such Securities held by each Security Beneficial Owner to be redeemed in accordance with its procedures. Any redemption of the Securities of this series, in whole or in part, prior to the stated maturity date is subject to the prior concurrence or approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or their successor as the Company's primary federal banking regulator (the "Federal Reserve"), or the staff thereof, (i) if such approval is then required in order for securities such as the Securities to qualify as tier 1 capital of a bank holding company under applicable capital adequacy guidelines, regulations, policies, or published interpretations of the Federal Reserve, or (ii) if the Federal Reserve or its staff has informed the Company that it must obtain such approval before redeeming the Securities. In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof. In case an Event of Default and Acceleration, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all of the Securities may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series affected at the time outstanding, as defined in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing 19
in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Securities of any series, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holders of each Security then outstanding and affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of all of the Holders of the Securities of such series, to waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and of any Security issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security. No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Security at the time and place and at the rate and in the money herein prescribed. The Company shall have the right at any time during the term of the Securities and from time to time to extend the interest payment period of such Securities for up to 40 consecutive quarters (an "Extended Interest Payment Period"), at the end of which period the Company shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid (together with interest thereon at the rate specified for the Securities to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law); provided, that no such Extended Interest Payment Period shall extend beyond the maturity of the Securities; and provided further that during any such Extended Interest Payment Period (a) the Company shall not declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto (other than (i) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, (ii) repurchases of shares of common stock of the Company pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the Extended Interest Payment Period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan, (iii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Company's capital stock for any other class or series of the Company's capital stock, (iv) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged) or (v) the purchase of capital 20
stock of the Company in connection with the distribution thereof), and (b) the Company shall not make any payment of interest on or principal of (or premium, if any, on), or repay, repurchase or redeem, any debt securities or guarantees issued by the Company which rank pari passu with or junior to the Securities. The foregoing, however, will not apply to any stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid. Before the termination of any such Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company may further extend such Extended Interest Payment Period, provided that such Extended Interest Payment Period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof shall not exceed 40 consecutive quarters. At the termination of any such Extended Interest Payment Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and any additional amounts then due, the Company may commence a new Extended Interest Payment Period. Commencing on the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, if any Deferred Interest is outstanding, the Company shall continuously use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect sales of shares of its common stock, including treasury shares, in an amount that will generate sufficient net proceeds to enable the Company to pay in full all Deferred Interest on the Securities then outstanding; provided that the Company shall not be obligated to make offers for or effect sales of its common stock during the occurrence and continuation of a Market Disruption Event or a Supervisory Event. The Company's obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell shares of its common stock to pay all Deferred Interest on the Securities shall resume at such time as no Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event exists or is continuing. If an Extended Interest Payment Period continues beyond its Fifth Deferral Anniversary, the Company may not pay on any Interest Payment Date interest that has accrued on any Security during the Quarterly Interest Accrual Period immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, until the Company has paid all Deferred Interest at such time outstanding on all of the Securities using the proceeds from the New Equity Amount, provided, however, that the Company may pay such Deferred Interest with cash from any source (i) upon and following the Tenth Deferral Anniversary, (ii) upon the Maturity of the Securities, (iii) during the occurrence and continuation of a Market Disruption Event or a Supervisory Event, (iv) if the Company has previously sold shares of its common stock up to the Share Cap Amount and the Company has not increased the Share Cap Amount or (v) if an Event of Default and Acceleration shall have occurred and be continuing. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Security is transferable by the registered Holder hereof on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Trustee in the City and State of New York accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Trustee duly executed by the registered Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount and series will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge will be made for any such transfer, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in relation thereto. 21
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and the Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and premium, if any, and interest due hereon and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, as such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released. [The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $25 and any integral multiple thereof.] [This Global Security is exchangeable for Securities in definitive form only under certain limited circumstances set forth in the Indenture. Securities of this series so issued are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $25 and any integral multiple thereof.] As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations [herein and] therein set forth. Securities of this series [so issued] are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. Section 2.4. Form of Trustee's Certificate of Authentication.

There shall be established in or pursuant to a Board Resolution, and set forth in an Officers' Certificate, or established in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, prior to the issuance of Securities of any series: (1) the title of the Securities of the series (which shall distinguish the Securities of the series from all Securities of any other series); (2) the date or dates on which the principal of the Securities of the series is payable; (3) the rate or rates at which the Securities of the series shall bear interest or the Floating or Adjustable Rate Provision pursuant to which such rates shall be determined, the date or dates from which any such interest shall accrue, the Interest Payment Dates on which any such interest shall be payable and the Regular Record Date for the interest payable on any Interest Payment Date (if such Interest Payment Dates or Regular Record Dates differ from those provided herein); (4) the place or places where the principal of (and any premium, if any) and interest on Securities of the series shall be payable; (5) in addition to the redemption rights provided herein, the period or periods within which (including the Redemption Option Date for the series) and the price or prices at which any Securities of the series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company; (6) if other than denominations of $25 and any integral multiple thereof, the denominations in which Securities of the series shall be issuable; (7) any other defaults applicable with respect to the Securities of the series in addition to those provided in Section 5.7(a) through (f); (8) any other covenant or warranty included for the benefit of Securities of the series in addition to (and not inconsistent with) those included in this Indenture for the benefit of Securities of all series, or any other covenant or warranty included for the benefit of Securities of the series in lieu of any covenant or warranty included in this Indenture for the benefit of Securities of all series, or any provision that any covenant or warranty included in this Indenture for the 23
benefit of Securities of all series shall not be for the benefit of Securities of the series, or any combination of such covenants, warranties or provisions; (9) the subordination terms of the Securities of the series; (10) the provisions of this Indenture, if any, that shall not apply to the series; and (11) any other terms of the series (which additional terms shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture). All Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to such Board Resolution and set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in the Officers' Certificate referred to above or in any such indenture supplemental hereto. If any of the terms of the Securities of a series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of the Securities of such series. Section 3.2. Denominations. The Securities of each series shall be issuable in registered form without coupons and in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 3.1. In the absence of any such provisions with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $25 and any integral multiple thereof. Section 3.3. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating. The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman or a Vice Chairman of the Board, its President, a Vice President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Accounting Officer, the Treasurer, any Deputy Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile. Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall 24
authenticate and deliver such Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established in or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 3.1, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive at the time of the initial delivery by the Company of Securities of such series to the Trustee for authentication, and (subject to Section 6.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating, (1) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 2.1, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; (2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 3.1, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and (3) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by or on behalf of the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement or creditors' rights and to general equity principles. If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. Section 3.4. Temporary Securities. Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon receipt of a Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the directors or officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities. 25
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for Securities of that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series. Section 3.5. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange. The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities, or of Securities of a particular series, and of transfers of Securities or of Securities of such series. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided. Subject to Section 3.11, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for Securities of that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of like tenor of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount. Subject to Section 3.11, at the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of like tenor of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and 26
the Security Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4, 9.6 or 11.7 not involving any transfer. The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of such series selected for redemption under Section 11.3 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part. Section 3.6. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities. If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security. Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder. 27
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities. Section 3.7. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved. Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest. Interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below: (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2). (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the 28
requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after written notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee in its sole discretion. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security. For the purposes of determining the Holders who are entitled to participate in any distribution on the Securities in respect of which a Regular Record Date or a Special Record Date is not otherwise provided for in this Indenture, or for the purpose of any other action (unless provided for pursuant to Section 3.1), the Company may from time to time fix a date, not more than 90 days prior to the date of the payment of distribution or other action, as the case may be, as a record date for the determination of the identity of the Holders of record for such purposes. Section 3.8. Persons Deemed Owners. The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.7) interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary. Section 3.9. Cancellation. All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. Unless otherwise directed by a Company Order, delivery of which must be delivered in a timely manner to prevent such destruction, all cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be destroyed by it, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a written request of the Company, shall deliver a certificate of such destruction to the Company. Section 3.10. Interest. (a) Each Security will bear interest at the rate established for the series of Securities of which such Security is a part pursuant to Section 3.1 (the "Coupon Rate") from and including the original date of issuance of such Security until the principal 29
thereof becomes due and payable, and on any overdue principal and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the Coupon Rate, compounded quarterly, payable (subject to the provisions of Article Four) quarterly in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year (or in such other periodic installments on such other dates established as payment dates for the series of Securities of which such Security is a part pursuant to Section 3.1) (each, an "Interest Payment Date") commencing on the date established for the series of Securities of which such Security is a part pursuant to Section 3.1, to the Person in whose name such Security or any Predecessor Security is registered, at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest installment, which, in respect of any Securities of which the Institutional Trustee of any Citigroup Trust is the Holder or a Global Security, shall be the close of business on the Business Day next preceding that Interest Payment Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Preferred Securities of a Citigroup Trust are no longer in book-entry only form or, except if the Securities originally issued to such Citigroup Trust are held by the Institutional Trustee of such Citigroup Trust, the Securities of any series are not represented by a Global Security, the Company may select a Regular Record Date for such interest installment on such series of Securities which shall be any date more than 14 days but less than 60 days before an Interest Payment Date. (b) The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and will include the first day but exclude the last day of such period. Except as provided in the following sentence, the amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly period for which interest is computed, will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in each 30-day month. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Securities of any series is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date. (c) If, at any time while the Institutional Trustee of a Citigroup Trust is the Holder of Securities of any series, such Citigroup Trust or such Institutional Trustee is required to pay any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature (other than withholding taxes) imposed by the United States, or any other taxing authority, then, in any case, the Company will pay as additional interest ("Additional Interest") on the Securities of such series, such additional amounts as shall be required so that the net amounts received and retained by such Citigroup Trust and/or such Institutional Trustee, as the case may be, after paying such taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges will be equal to the amounts Citigroup Trust and/or such Institutional Trustee, as the case may be, would have received had no such taxes, duties, assessments or other government charges been imposed. 30
Section 3.11. Form and Payment. Except as provided in Section 3.12, the Securities of each series shall be issued in fully registered certificated form without interest coupons. Principal and interest on the Securities issued in certificated form will be payable, the transfer of such Securities will be registrable, and such Securities will be exchangeable, for Securities of the same series bearing identical terms and provisions at the office or agency of the Trustee; provided, however, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the Holders of such Securities at such address as shall appear in the Security Register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Holder of all Securities of any series is the Institutional Trustee of any Citigroup Trust, the payment of the principal of and interest (including Compounded Interest and Additional Interest, if any) on Securities of such series will be made at such place and to such account as may be designated by the Institutional Trustee. Section 3.12. Global Securities. (a) In connection with Dissolution Event with respect to any Citigroup Trust, (i) the Securities in non book-entry certificated form held by such Citigroup Trust, or its Institutional Trustee, will be presented to the Trustee by the Institutional Trustee of such Citigroup Trust in exchange for a Global Security in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Securities of the series issued to such Citigroup Trust, to be registered in the name of the Depositary, or its nominee, and delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary for crediting to the accounts of its participants pursuant to the instructions of the Regular Trustees of the relevant Citigroup Trust. The Company upon any such presentation shall execute a Global Security in such aggregate principal amount and deliver the same to the Trustee for authentication and delivery in accordance with this Indenture. Payments on any Securities issued as a Global Security will be made to the Depositary; and (ii) if any Preferred Securities of a Citigroup Trust are held in non book-entry certificated form, the Securities in non book-entry certificated form held by such Citigroup Trust, or its Institutional Trustee, may be presented to the Trustee by the Institutional Trustee of such Citigroup Trust and any Preferred Security Certificate which represents Preferred Securities of such Citigroup Trust other than Preferred Securities held by the Depositary or its nominee ("Non Book-Entry Preferred Securities") will be deemed to represent Securities presented to the Trustee by such Institutional Trustee having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Non Book-Entry Preferred Securities until such Preferred Security Certificates are presented to the Security Registrar for transfer or reissuance at which time such Preferred Security Certificates will be cancelled and a Security, registered in the name of the holder of the Preferred Security Certificate or the transferee of the holder of such Preferred Security Certificate, as the case may be, with an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Preferred Security Certificate cancelled, will be executed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee for authentication and delivery in accordance with this Indenture. On issue of such Securities, Securities with an equivalent 31
aggregate principal amount that were presented by the Institutional Trustee to the Trustee will be deemed to have been cancelled. (b) A Global Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to another nominee of the Depositary, or to a successor Depositary selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor Depositary. (c) If at any time the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for any series of Securities or if at any time the Depositary for such series shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act, or other applicable statute or regulation, and a successor Depositary for such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, the Company will execute, and, subject to this Article III, the Trustee, upon written notice from the Company, will authenticate and deliver the Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security in exchange for such Global Security. In addition, the Company may at any time determine that the Securities of any series shall no longer be represented by a Global Security. In such event the Company will execute, and subject to Section 3.5, the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers Certificate evidencing such determination by the Company, will authenticate and deliver the Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security for such series in exchange for such Global Security. Upon the exchange of the Global Security for such Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, the Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Such Securities in definitive registered form issued in exchange for the Global Security shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Depositary, for delivery to the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered. ARTICLE IV SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE; DEFEASANCE Section 4.1. Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture. This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when 32
(1) either (A) all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.6 and (ii) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 10.3) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (B) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, or (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be; (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with. Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 6.7, the Company's obligation to pay the expenses of any Citigroup Trust under Section 10.6 (except upon the application of subclauses 1(A) or 1(B)(i) above), the obligations of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 6.14, and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 4.2 and the last paragraph of Section 10.3 shall survive. 33
Section 4.2. Defeasance and Discharge. The following provisions shall apply to the Securities of each series unless specifically otherwise provided in a Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or indenture supplemental hereto provided pursuant to Section 3.1. In addition to discharge of this Indenture pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 4.3, in the case of any series of Securities with respect to which an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, as certified pursuant to subparagraph (a) of Section 4.4 can be determined at the time of making the deposit referred to in such subparagraph (a), the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness on all the Securities of such a series as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 4.4 are satisfied, and the provisions of this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series shall no longer be in effect (except as to (i) rights of registration of transfer and exchange of Securities of such series, (ii) substitution of mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities of such series, (iii) rights of Holders of Securities of such series to receive, solely from the trust fund described in subparagraph (a) of Section 4.4, payments of principal thereof and interest, if any, thereon upon the original stated due dates therefor (but not upon acceleration), (iv) the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder, (v) this Section 4.2, (vi) the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series as beneficiaries hereof with respect to the property so deposited with the Trustee payable to all or any of them and (vii) the Company's obligation to pay the expenses of any Citigroup Trust under Section 10.6) (hereinafter called "Defeasance"), and the Trustee at the cost and expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same. Section 4.3. Covenant Defeasance. In the case of any series of Securities with respect to which an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, as certified pursuant to subparagraph (a) of Section 4.4 can be determined at the time of making the deposit referred to in such subparagraph (a), (i) the Company shall be released from its obligations under any covenants specified in or pursuant to this Indenture (except as to (A) rights of registration of transfer and exchange of Securities of such series, (B) substitution of mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities of such series, (C) rights of Holders of Securities of such series to receive, from the Company pursuant to Section 10.1, payments of principal thereof and interest, if any, thereon upon the original stated due dates therefor (but not upon acceleration), (D) the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder, (E) the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series as beneficiaries hereof with respect to the property so deposited with the Trustee payable to all or any of them and (F) the Company's obligation to pay the expenses of any Citigroup Trust under Section 10.6), and (ii) the occurrence of any event specified in Sections 5.7(d) (with respect to any of the covenants specified in or pursuant to this Indenture) and 5.7(e) shall be deemed not to be or result in a Default, in each case with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 4.4 are satisfied 34
(hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance"), and the Trustee, at the cost and expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same. For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 5.7(d)), whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and the Securities of such series shall be unaffected thereby. Section 4.4. Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance. The following shall be the conditions to application of either Section 4.2 or 4.3 to the Outstanding Securities: (a) with reference to Section 4.2 or 4.3, the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the Trustee as funds in trust, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of Securities of such series (i) cash in an amount, or (ii) direct obligations of the United States of America, backed by its full faith and credit ("U.S. Government Obligations"), maturing as to principal and interest, if any, at such times and in such amounts as will insure the availability of cash, or (iii) a combination thereof, in each case sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, the principal of and interest, if any, on all Securities of such series on each date that such principal or interest, if any, is due and payable; (b) in the case of Defeasance under Section 4.2, the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel based on the fact that (x) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (y), since the date hereof, there has been a change in the applicable United States federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of the Securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit, Defeasance and discharge and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times, as would have been the case if such deposit, Defeasance and discharge had not occurred; (c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance under Section 4.3, the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, and such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of the Securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times, as would have been the case if such deposit and Covenant Defeasance had not occurred; 35

Section 4.6. Indemnity for U.S. Government Obligations. The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 4.4 or the principal or interest received in respect of such obligations other than any such tax, fee or other charge that by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities. Section 4.7. Reinstatement. If the Trustee is unable to apply any money or Government Obligations in accordance with Section 4.4 by reason of any legal preceding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 4.4, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or Government Obligations in accordance with Section 4.4; provided that, if the Company has made any payment of principal or interest on the Securities of any series because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money or Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent. 36
ARTICLE V REMEDIES Section 5.1. Events of Default and Acceleration. The term "Event of Default and Acceleration" as used in this Indenture with respect to Securities of any series shall mean one of the following described events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and Acceleration and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body): (a) failure to pay in full interest accrued upon any Security of that series upon the conclusion of a period consisting of 40 consecutive quarters, commencing with the earliest quarter for which interest (including Deferred Interest) has not been paid in full, and continuance of such failure to pay for a period of 30 days; (b) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case under the Federal bankruptcy code, as now or hereafter constituted, or any other applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee or sequestrator (or similar official) of the Company or for substantially all of its property, or ordering the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or (c) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case under the Federal bankruptcy code, as now or hereafter constituted, or any other applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or the consent by the Company to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, or the consent by the Company to the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, custodian or sequestrator (or similar official) of the Company or for substantially all of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Section 5.2. Acceleration of Maturity. If any one or more Event of Default and Acceleration shall occur with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, then, and in each and every such case, during the continuance of any such Event of Default and Acceleration, the Trustee or the Holders of 25% or more in principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of such series then Outstanding, if not then due and payable, to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by such Holders), and upon any such declaration the same shall become and be immediately due and payable, anything in this Indenture or in the Securities of such series contained to the contrary 37
notwithstanding. This provision, however, is subject to the condition that, if at any time after the principal of all the Securities of such series shall have been so declared to be due and payable, all arrears of interest, if any, upon all the Securities of such series (with interest, to the extent that interest thereon shall be legally enforceable, on any overdue installment of interest at the rate borne by the Securities of such series) and all amounts owing the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder under Section 6.7 and all other sums payable under this Indenture (except the principal of the Securities of such series which would not be due and payable were it not for such declaration) shall be paid by the Company, and every other Default under this Indenture, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, shall have been made good to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee or of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding, or provision deemed by the Trustee or by such Holders to be adequate therefor shall have been made, then and in every such case the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, waive the Event of Default and Acceleration by reason of which the principal of the Securities of such series shall have been so declared to be due and payable and may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences; but no such waiver, rescission or annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Any declaration by the Trustee pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be by written notice to the Company, and any declaration or waiver by the Holders of Securities of any series pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be by written notice to the Company and the Trustee. Section 5.3. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee. If the Company shall fail for a period of 30 days to pay any installment of interest on the Securities of any series or shall fail to pay the principal of and premium, if any, on any of the Securities of such series when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity, or by call for redemption by declaration as authorized by this Indenture or otherwise, then, upon demand of the Trustee, the Company will pay to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of Securities of such series then Outstanding the whole amount which then shall have become due and payable on any such Security, with interest on the overdue principal and premium, if any, and (so far as the same may be legally enforceable) on the overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Securities of such series, and all amounts owing the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder under Section 6.7. In case the Company shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceeding at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of such series, and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of such series, wherever situated, in the manner provided by 38
law. Every recovery of judgment in any such action or other proceeding, subject to the payment to the Trustee of all amounts owing the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder under Section 6.7, shall be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of such series of Securities which shall be the subject of such action or proceeding. All rights of action upon or under any of the Securities or this Indenture may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities and without the production of any thereof at any trial or any proceeding relative thereto. If a Default, of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge, with respect to any series of Securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture, or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy. Section 5.4. Trustee to File Claims As Attorney-In-Fact. The Trustee is hereby appointed, and each and every Holder of the Securities, by receiving and holding the same, shall be conclusively deemed to have appointed the Trustee, the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of such Holder, with authority to make or file (whether or not the Company shall be in default in respect of the payment of the principal of, or interest on, any of the Securities), in its own name and as trustee of an express trust or otherwise as it shall deem advisable, in any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or to their respective creditors or property, any and all claims, proofs of claim, proofs of debt, petitions, consents, other papers and documents and amendments of any thereof, as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder and of the Holders of the Securities allowed in any such proceeding and to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim, and to execute and deliver any and all other papers and documents and to do and perform any and all other acts and things, as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to enforce in any such proceeding any of the claims of the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder and of any of such Holders in respect of any of the Securities; and any receiver, assignee, trustee, custodian or debtor in any such proceeding is hereby authorized, and each and every taker or Holder of the Securities, by receiving and holding the same, shall be conclusively deemed to have authorized any such receiver, assignee, trustee, custodian or debtor, to make any such payment or delivery only to or on the order of the Trustee, and to pay to the Trustee any amount due it and any predecessor trustee hereunder under Section 6.7; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize or empower the Trustee to consent to or accept or adopt, on behalf of any Holder of Securities, any plan of reorganization or readjustment of the Company affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize or empower the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of any Securities in any such proceeding. 39
Section 5.5. Application of Money Collected. Any moneys collected by the Trustee with respect to a series of Securities under this Article Five shall be applied in the order following, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee for the distribution of such moneys, upon presentation of the several Securities, and stamping thereon the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof, if fully paid: First: To the payment of all amounts due to the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder under Section 6.7. Second: Subject to Article Fourteen, in case the principal of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall not have become due and be unpaid, to the payment of interest on the Securities of such series, in the order of the maturity of the installments of such interest, with interest (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon the overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by such Securities, such payments to be made ratably to the Persons entitled thereto. Third: Subject to Article Fourteen, in case the principal of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, to the payment of the whole amount then owing and unpaid upon the Securities of such series for principal and premium, if any, and interest, with interest on the overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Securities of such series, and in case such moneys shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amounts so due and unpaid upon the Securities of such series, then to the payment of such principal and premium, if any, and interest without preference or priority of principal and premium, if any, over interest, or of interest over principal and premium, if any, or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Security of such series over any other Security of such series, ratably to the aggregate of such principal and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest. Section 5.6. Control by Holders; Waiver of Past Default. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee hereunder, or of exercising any trust or power hereby conferred upon the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series; provided, however, that the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee being advised by counsel determines that the action so directed may not lawfully be taken or would be unduly prejudicial to Holders not joining in such direction or would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of the Securities of any series, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such series of Outstanding Securities may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder and its consequences 40
except a default not theretofore cured in the payment of interest or any premium on or the principal of the Securities of such series or in respect of any covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of each series affected thereby; provided, however, that if the Securities of such series are held by a Citigroup Trust or a trustee of such trust, such waiver or modification to such waiver shall not be effective until the holders of Trust Securities representing a majority in liquidation preference of Trust Securities of the applicable Citigroup Trust shall have consented to such waiver or modification to such waiver; provided further, that if the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Securities is required, such waiver shall not be effective until each holder of the Trust Securities of the applicable Citigroup Trust shall have consented to such waiver. Upon any such waiver the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any default hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by this Section 5.6, said default shall for all purposes of the Securities of such series and this Indenture cease to exist, and any Default or Event of Default and Acceleration arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing. Section 5.7. Limitation on Suits; Default. No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity for the execution of any trust hereunder or for the appointment of a receiver or for any other remedy hereunder, in each case with respect to a Default with respect to such series of Securities, unless such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of the happening of one or more of the Defaults herein specified with respect to such series of Securities, and unless also the Holders of 25% or more in principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding shall have requested the Trustee in writing to take action in respect of the matter complained of, and unless also there shall have been offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee, for 60 days after receipt of such notification, request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding; and such notification, request and offer of indemnity are hereby declared in every such case to be conditions precedent to any such action, suit or proceeding by any Holder of any Security of such series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of the Holders of Securities of such series shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by his or their action to enforce any right hereunder, except in the manner herein provided, and that every action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Indenture or in the Securities of such series shall affect or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of such series to the respective Holders of such Securities at the respective due dates in 41
such Securities stated, or affect or impair the right, which is also absolute and unconditional, of such Holders to institute suit to enforce the payment thereof. The following events shall be "Defaults" with respect to any series of Securities under this Indenture: (a) an Event of Default and Acceleration with respect to such series specified in Section 5.1; or (b) the failure of the Company to pay any installment of interest on any Security of such series, when and as the same shall become payable, which failure shall have continued unremedied for a period of 30 days, it being understood that the occurrence of an Extended Interest Payment Period in accordance with the terms of such Security will not constitute such a default; or (c) the failure of the Company to pay the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Security of such series, when and as the same shall become payable, whether at maturity as therein expressed, by call for redemption, by declaration as authorized by this Indenture or otherwise, whether or not permitted by Article Fourteen; or (d) the failure of the Company, subject to the provisions of Section 8.1, to observe and perform any other of the covenants or agreements on the part of the Company contained in this Indenture (including any indenture supplemental hereto) (other than a covenant or agreement which has been expressly included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of a series of Securities other than that series), which failure shall not have been remedied for a period of 90 days after written notice shall have been given to the Company by the Trustee or shall have been given to the Company and the Trustee by Holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding, specifying such failure and requiring the Company to remedy the same; or (e) in the event Securities of a series are issued and sold to a Citigroup Trust or a trustee of such trust in connection with the issuance of Trust Securities by such Citigroup Trust, such Citigroup Trust shall have voluntarily or involuntarily dissolved, wound-up its business or otherwise terminated its existence except in connection with (i) the distribution of Securities to holders of Trust Securities in liquidation or redemption of their interests in such Citigroup Trust upon a Special Event with respect to such Citigroup Trust, (ii) the redemption of all of the outstanding Trust Securities of such Citigroup Trust or (iii) certain mergers, consolidations or amalgamations, each as permitted by the Declaration of such Citigroup Trust; or 42
(f) any other Default provided with respect to Securities of that series. Section 5.8. Costs and Attorneys' Fees in Legal Proceedings. All parties to this Indenture and the Holders of the Securities agree that the court may in its discretion require, in any action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any action, suit or proceeding against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such action, suit or proceeding of an undertaking to pay the costs of such action, suit or proceeding, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such action, suit or proceeding, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 5.8 shall not apply to any action, suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee, to any action, suit or proceeding instituted by any one or more Holders of Securities holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, or to any action, suit or proceeding instituted by any Holder of Securities for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or the interest on, any of the Securities, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Securities. Section 5.9. Remedies Cumulative. Except as provided in the last sentence of Section 3.6, no remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities of any series is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies, and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of the Securities of any series to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Default shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Default or an acquiescence therein; and every power and remedy given by this Article Five to the Trustee and to the Holders, respectively, may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be. In case the Trustee or any Holder of Securities shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and the proceedings for the enforcement thereof shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of waiver or for any other reason or shall have been adjudicated adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall severally and respectively be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder and thereafter all rights, remedies and powers of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceedings had been instituted, except as to any matters so waived or adjudicated. Section 5.10. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the 43
Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no law had been enacted. ARTICLE VI THE TRUSTEE Section 6.1. Certain Duties and Responsibilities. (a) Except during the continuance of a Default; (1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture. (b) In case a Default with respect to any series of Securities, of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge, has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. (c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that (1) this subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of subsection (a) of this Section; (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; (3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series determined as provided in Section 5.6, relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or 44
exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series; and (4) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or indemnity, reasonably satisfactory to it, against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. (d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conductor affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. Section 6.2. Notice of Defaults. Within 90 days after the occurrence of any Default hereunder with respect to Securities of any series, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders of Securities of such series, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register, notice of such Default hereunder actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, unless such Default shall have been cured or waived; provided that, except in the case of a Default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a Responsible Officer of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders of Securities of such series; and provided, further, that in the case of any Default of the character specified in Section 5.7(e) with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof. Section 6.3. Certain Rights of Trustee. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.1 (a) the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; (b) any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or Company Order, and any resolution of the Board of Directors may be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution; (c) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, conclusively rely upon an Officers' Certificate; 45
(d) the Trustee may consult with counsel and the written advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon; (e) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity, reasonably satisfactory to it, against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; (f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney; and (g) the Trustee may execute any of the trust or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder. (h) the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any Default or Event of Default and Acceleration with respect to the Securities, unless either (1) a Responsible Officer shall have actual knowledge of such Default or Event of Default and Acceleration or (2) written notice of such Default or Event of Default and Acceleration shall have been given to the Trustee by the Company or by any Holder of the Securities; and (i) the permissive rights of the Trustee enumerated herein shall not be construed as duties. Section 6.4. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities. The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee or any Authenticating Agent assumes no responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. The Trustee or any Authenticating Agent shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof. Section 6.5. May Hold Securities. The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 6.8 and 6.13, may otherwise 46
deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent. Section 6.6. Money Held in Trust. Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed with the Company. Section 6.7. Compensation and Reimbursement. The Company agrees (1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time such reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); (2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents, nominees, custodians and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and (3) to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trust hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. As security for the performance of the obligations of the Company under this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the benefit of Holders of particular Securities. The obligations of the Company under this Section shall survive the removal or resignation of the Trustee and the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. When the Trustee incurs any expenses or renders any services after the occurrence of an Event of Default and Acceleration specified in Section 5.1(b) or Section 5.1(c), such expenses and the compensation for such services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the United States Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the United States Code) or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors. 47
Section 6.8. Disqualification; Conflicting Interests. The Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 during the period of time provided for therein. In determining whether the Trustee has a conflicting interest as defined in Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 with respect to the Securities of any series, there shall be excluded for purposes of the conflicting interest provisions of such Section 310(b) the Securities of every other series issued under this Indenture. Nothing herein shall prevent the Trustee from filing with the Commission the application referred to in the second to last paragraph of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. Section 6.9. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility. There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervision or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article. Section 6.10. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor. (a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11. (b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 6.11 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. (c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company. (d) If at any time: (1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 6.8(a) after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or 48
(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 6.9 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or (3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then, in any such case, (i) the Company, by a Board Resolution, may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (ii) subject to Section 5.8, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees. (e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 6.11, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series. (f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series by mailing written notice of such event by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Securities of such series as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office. 49
Section 6.11. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor. (a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder. (b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to the Securities of all series for which it is the Trustee hereunder, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any mist or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates. (c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be. 50
(d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article. (e) The Trustee shall not be liable for the acts or omissions to act of any successor Trustee. Section 6.12. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business. Any corporation or association into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or association resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation or association to which all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee may be sold or otherwise transferred, shall be the successor trustee hereunder without any further act. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities. Section 6.13. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company. The Trustee shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act Section 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in the Trust Indenture Act Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to the Trust Indenture Act Section 311(a) to the extent indicated therein. Section 6.14. Appointment of Authenticating Agent. At any time when any of the Securities remain Outstanding the Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 3.6, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent 51
shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.

Securities of each series are redeemable before their respective Stated Maturities in accordance with their respective terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article. Any redemption of any series of Securities, in whole or in part, prior to their respective Stated Maturities shall be subject to receipt by the Company of the prior concurrence or approval of the Federal Reserve or its staff, (i) if such concurrence or approval is then required in order for securities such as the Securities to qualify as tier 1 capital under applicable capital adequacy guidelines, regulations, policies, published interpretations, or concurrence or approval of the Federal Reserve or its staff, or (ii) if the Federal Reserve or its staff has informed the Company that it must obtain such approval before redeeming the Securities.

In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction. (b) If a partial redemption of any series of Securities would result in the delisting of the Preferred Securities of the Citigroup Trust that purchased such Securities from any national securities exchange or other organization on which the Preferred Securities of such Citigroup Trust are then listed, the Company shall not be permitted to effect such partial redemption and may only redeem such series of Securities in whole. Section 11.3. Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed. If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series; provided, that, if at the time of redemption such Securities are registered as a Global Security, the Depositary shall determine, in accordance with its procedures, the principal amount of such Securities held by each Security Beneficial Owner to be redeemed. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.

Section 11.5. Deposit of Redemption Price. Prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 10.3) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date. Section 11.6. Securities Payable on Redemption Date. Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date; provided that installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.7.

The Redemption Price shall be paid prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of such redemption or such earlier time as the Company determines, provided that the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay the 66
Redemption Price by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date such Redemption Price is to be paid. Section 11.7. Securities Redeemed in Part. Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment for Securities of that series (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of like tenor and of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered. Section 11.8. Tax Event Redemption. If a Tax Event with respect to any Citigroup Trust has occurred and is continuing and: (a) the Company has received a Redemption Tax Opinion with respect to such Citigroup Trust; or (b) after receiving a Tax Event Opinion, the Regular Trustees of such Citigroup Trust shall have been informed by tax counsel rendering the Tax Event Opinion that a No Recognition Opinion cannot be delivered to such Citigroup Trust, then, notwithstanding Section 11.2(a) but subject to Section 11.2(b) and Section 11.1, the Company shall have the right upon not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days notice to the Holders of Securities of the series issued to such Citigroup Trust, or to its Institutional Trustee, to redeem such Securities, in whole or in part, for cash within 90 days following the occurrence of such Tax Event at the Redemption Price, provided that if at the time there is available to the Company or such Citigroup Trust the opportunity to eliminate, within such 90-day period, the Tax Event by taking some ministerial action ("Ministerial Action"), such as filing a form or making an election, or pursuing some other similar reasonable measure which has no adverse effect on the Company, the Trust or the holders of the Trust Securities of such Citigroup Trust, the Company or such Citigroup Trust shall pursue such Ministerial Action in lieu of redemption, and, provided further that the Company shall have no right to redeem such Securities while the Company or such Citigroup Trust is pursuing any Ministerial Action pursuant to its obligations under the Declaration of such Citigroup Trust. 67
ARTICLE XII [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED] ARTICLE XIII EXTENSION OF INTEREST PAYMENT PERIOD Section 13.1. Extension of Interest Payment Period. The Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time during the term of the Securities of any series, to defer payments of interest by extending the interest payment period of all Securities of such series for a period not exceeding 40 consecutive quarters (the "Extended Interest Payment Period"), during which Extended Interest Payment Period no interest shall be due and payable on Securities of such series; provided that no Extended Interest Payment Period may extend beyond the Maturity of such Securities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, interest, the payment of which has been deferred because of the extension of the interest payment period pursuant to this Section 13.1, will bear interest thereon at the Coupon Rate compounded quarterly for each quarter of the Extended Interest Payment Period ("Compounded Interest"). At the end of any Extended Interest Payment Period with respect to any series of Securities, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid on such Securities, including any Additional Interest and Compounded Interest (together, "Deferred Interest") that shall be payable to the Holders of Securities of such Series in whose names such Securities are registered in the Security Register on the first record date after the end of such Extended Interest Payment Period. Before the termination of any Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company may further extend such period; provided that such period, together with all such further extensions thereof, shall not exceed 40 consecutive quarters; and provided further that no prepayment of interest during an Extended Interest Payment Period shall allow the Company to extend such Extended Interest Payment Period beyond 40 consecutive quarters. Upon the termination of any Extended Interest Payment Period with respect to any series of Securities and upon the payment of all Deferred Interest then due, the Company may commence a new Extended Interest Payment Period with respect to such series of Securities, subject to the foregoing requirements. No interest on a series of Securities shall be due and payable during an Extended Interest Payment Period with respect thereto, except at the end thereof, provided the Company may prepay at any time all or any portion of the interest accrued during any Extended Interest Payment Period, subject to the limitation described in Section 13.5. Section 13.2. Notice of Extension. (a) If the Institutional Trustee of a Citigroup Trust is the only Holder of Securities of a series at the time the Company selects an Extended Interest Payment Period with respect thereto, the Company shall give written notice to the Regular Trustees and the Institutional Trustee of such Citigroup Trust and to the Trustee of its selection of such Extended Interest Payment Period at least one Business Day before the earlier of (i) the next succeeding date on which Distributions on the Trust Securities 68
issued by such Citigroup Trust are payable, or (ii) the date such Citigroup Trust is required to give notice of the record date, or the date such Distributions would be payable if not for such Extended Interest Payment Period, to the New York Stock Exchange or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to holders of the Preferred Securities issued by such Citigroup Trust, but in any event at least one Business Day before such record date. (b) If the Institutional Trustee of a Citigroup Trust is not the only Holder of Securities of a series at the time the Company selects an Extended Interest Payment Period with respect thereto, the Company shall give written notice to the Holders of Securities of such series and the Trustee of its selection of such Extended Interest Payment Period at least 10 Business Days before the earlier of (i) the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, or (ii) the date the Company is required to give notice of the record or payment date of such interest payment to the New York Stock Exchange or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to Holders of Securities of such series. (c) The quarter in which any notice is given pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section 13.2 shall be counted as one of the 40 quarters permitted in the maximum Extended Interest Payment Period with respect to any series of Securities permitted under Section 1.3. (d) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Indenture, the Company shall not be required to give notice to any person of its selection of an Extended Interest Payment Period more than 15 Business Days before the next succeeding Interest Payment Date of the affected Securities. Section 13.3. Limitation of Transactions. If with respect to any series of Securities (i) the Company shall exercise its right to defer payments of interest thereon as provided in Section 13.1 or (ii) there shall have occurred any Default, then (a) the Company shall not declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto (other than (i) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, (ii) repurchases of shares of common stock of Citigroup pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the extension period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan (iii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Company's capital stock for any other class or series of the Company's capital stock, (iv) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged), or (v) purchase of Citigroup's capital stock in connection with the distribution thereof); and (b) the Company shall not make any payment of interest on, principal of or premium, if any, on, or repay, repurchase or redeem, any debt securities or guarantees issued by the Company that rank pari passu with or junior to the Securities of 69
such series (including the Securities of any other series), provided, however, the Company may declare and pay a stock dividend where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid. Section 13.4. Limitation on Source of Payment of Deferred Interest. If an Extended Interest Payment Period continues beyond its Fifth Deferral Anniversary, the Company may not pay Deferred Interest on the Securities on any date in an amount that exceeds the New Equity Amount for such date; provided, however, that (i) upon and following the Tenth Deferral Anniversary, (ii) upon the Maturity of the Securities, (iii) during the occurrence and continuation of a Market Disruption Event or a Supervisory Event, (iv) if the Company has previously sold shares of its common stock up to the Share Cap Amount and the Company has not increased the Share Cap Amount or (v) if an Event of Default and Acceleration shall have occurred and be continuing, the provisions of this Section 13.4 shall not apply and the Company may pay Deferred Interest with cash from any source. Section 13.5. Limitation on Current Interest Payment during an Extended Interest Payment Period. If an Extended Interest Payment Period continues beyond its Fifth Deferral Anniversary, the Company may not pay on any Interest Payment Date interest that has accrued on any Security during the Quarterly Interest Accrual Period immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, until the Company has paid all Deferred Interest at such time outstanding on all of the Securities. Section 13.6. Obligation to Effect Certain Common Stock Sales. (a) Commencing on the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, if any Deferred Interest is outstanding, the Company shall continuously use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect sales of shares of its common stock, including treasury shares, in an amount that will generate sufficient net proceeds to enable the Company to pay in full all Deferred Interest on the Securities then outstanding; provided that the Company shall not be obligated to make offers for or effect sales of its common stock during the occurrence and continuation of a Market Disruption Event or a Supervisory Event. The Company's obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell shares of its common stock to pay all Deferred Interest on the Securities shall resume at such time as no Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event exists or is continuing. (b) As used in this Section 13.6, the term "commercially reasonable efforts" means commercially reasonable efforts on the part of the Company to complete the sale of shares of its common stock, including treasury shares, to third parties that are not subsidiaries of the Company. The Company will not be considered to have used its commercially reasonable efforts to effect a sale of stock if it determines not to pursue or complete such sale solely due to pricing considerations. (c) The Company is not permitted to sell shares of common stock in excess of a number of shares of common stock which at June 30, 2006 is equal to 55,000,000 (the 70
"Share Cap Amount"), for the purpose of satisfying Section 13.6(a) or otherwise paying Deferred Interest on the Securities then outstanding. If the issued and outstanding shares of common stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, then the Share Cap Amount shall be correspondingly adjusted. The Company may, at its discretion, increase the Share Cap Amount (including through the increase of its authorized share capital, if necessary) if the Company determines that such increase is necessary to allow it to issue sufficient shares to satisfy its obligations to pay Deferred Interest on the Securities pursuant to Section 13.6(a) or otherwise pay Deferred Interest on the Securities. (d) Following the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, the Company shall apply the net proceeds received by it from sales of shares of its common stock, including sales of treasury shares, to the payment of all amounts owing in respect of Deferred Interest, with net proceeds to be paid promptly after receipt until all amounts owing in respect of Deferred Interest have been paid in full. In the event that net proceeds received by the Company from one or more sales of shares of its common stock following such Fifth Deferral Anniversary are not sufficient to satisfy the full amount of Deferred Interest, such net proceeds will be paid to the holders of the Securities on a pro rata basis; provided, that if the Company has outstanding at such time any debt securities ranking pari passu with the Securities under the terms of which the Company is obligated to sell shares of its common stock and apply the net proceeds to payment of deferred interest on such pari passu securities and the Company at such time is required to apply such proceeds to pay deferred interest on such pari passu securities, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Company from such sales and available for payment of such deferred interest shall be applied to the Securities and such pari passu securities on a pro rata basis. Notwithstanding the above, the Company shall not be obligated to apply such net proceeds or any portion thereof to the payment of Deferred Interest during the occurrence and continuation of Market Disruption Event or a Supervisory Event. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, under no circumstances will the Company be obligated to sell shares of Qualified Preferred Stock or to apply the proceeds of any such sale to pay Deferred Interest on the Securities. Section 13.7. Notice of Market Disruption Event. Upon and after the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, if a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall give, as promptly as possible after the Company becomes aware of such occurrence, a written notice (a "Market Disruption Event Notice") to the Trustee, stating the date on which such Market Disruption Event has occurred, the nature thereof and what action it will take in connection therewith. 71
Section 13.8. Notice of Supervisory Event. Upon and after the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, if a Supervisory Event has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall give, as promptly as possible after the Company becomes aware of such occurrence, a written notice (a "Supervisory Event Notice") to the Trustee stating that a Supervisory Event has commenced and the actions it will take in connection therewith. No later than five (5) Business Days following termination of a Supervisory Event, the Company shall give a written notice to the Trustee stating the date on which such Supervisory Event terminated. Section 13.9. Notices to the Federal Reserve. The Company shall give written notice to the Federal Reserve: (a) No later than five (5) Business Days following commencement of an Extended Interest Payment Period; and (b) Upon the Fifth Deferral Anniversary of such Extended Interest Payment Period. Section 13.10. Obligation to Notify Federal Reserve of Intent to Sell Stock. (a) As promptly as practicable after the Fifth Deferral Anniversary the Company shall give written notice to the Federal Reserve of its intent both (1) to sell shares of common stock or, at the Company's sole discretion, Qualified Preferred Stock and (2) to apply the net proceeds from such sale to pay Deferred Interest, and shall only take any such actions if the Federal Reserve does not disapprove of any such actions within ten (10) Business Days after the Company gives such notice to the Federal Reserve. (b) During the occurrence and continuation of a Supervisory Event, the Company will, no later than 30 Business Days prior to each Interest Payment Date, notify the Federal Reserve of its intention both (1) to sell shares of common stock and (2) to apply the net proceeds from such sale to pay Deferred Interest, and shall only take any such actions if the Federal Reserve does not disapprove of such actions within ten (10) Business Days after the Company gives such notice to the Federal Reserve. ARTICLE XIV SUBORDINATION OF SECURITIES Section 14.1. Agreement to Subordinate. The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of Securities issued hereunder by such Holder's acceptance thereof likewise covenants and agrees, that all Securities shall be issued subject to the provisions of this Article Fourteen; and each 72
Holder of a Security, whether upon original issue or upon transfer or assignment thereof, accepts and agrees to be bound by such provisions. The payment by the Company of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all Securities issued hereunder shall, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether outstanding at the date of this Indenture or thereafter incurred. No provision of this Article Fourteen shall prevent the occurrence of any Default hereunder. Section 14.2. Default on Senior Indebtedness. In the event and during the continuation of any default by the Company in the payment of principal, premium, interest or any other payment due on any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be, or in the event that the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be, has been accelerated because of a default, then, in either case, no payment shall be made by the Company with respect to the principal (including redemption payments) of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Securities or to acquire any of the Securities. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment shall be received by the Trustee, by any Holder or by any Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, money for any such payment is segregated and held in trust) when such payment is prohibited by the preceding paragraph of this Section 14.2, before all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full, or provision is made for such payment in money in accordance with its terms, such payment shall be held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or their respective representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, ratably according to the aggregate amount remaining unpaid on account of the principal, premium, interest or any other payment due on the Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be, remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Senior Indebtedness in full in money in accordance with its terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the benefit of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, but only to the extent that the holders of the Senior Indebtedness (or their representative or representatives or a trustee) notify the Trustee in writing within 90 days of such payment of the amounts then due and owing on the Senior Indebtedness and only the amounts specified in such notice to the Trustee shall be paid to the holders of Senior Indebtedness. Section 14.3. Liquidation; Dissolution; Bankruptcy. Upon any payment by the Company or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors upon any 73
dissolution or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings, all amounts due upon all Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall first be paid in full, or payment thereof provided for in money in accordance with its terms, before any payment is made by the Company on account of the principal (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities; and upon any such dissolution or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization, any payment by the Company, or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled to receive, except for the provisions of this Article Fourteen, shall be paid by the Company or by any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, or by the Holders of the Securities or by the Trustee under this Indenture if received by them or it, directly to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company (pro rata to such holders on the basis of the respective amounts of Senior Indebtedness held by such holders, as calculated by the Company) or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, to the extent necessary to pay such Senior Indebtedness in full, in money or money's worth, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, before any payment or distribution is made to the Holders of Securities or to the Trustee. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, prohibited by the foregoing, shall be received by the Trustee, by any Holder or by any Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, money for any such payment is segregated and held in trust) before all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full, or provision is made for such payment in money in accordance with its terms, such payment or distribution shall be held in trust for the benefit of and shall be paid over or delivered to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, ratably according to the aggregate amount remaining unpaid on account of the principal, premium, interest or any other payment due on the Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, as calculated by the Company, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be, remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Senior Indebtedness in full in money in accordance with its terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the benefit of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness. For purposes of this Article Fourteen, the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in this Article Fourteen with respect to the Securities to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be, that may at the time be outstanding, provided that (i) such Senior Indebtedness is assumed by the new 74
corporation, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness are not, without the consent of such holders, altered by such reorganization or readjustment. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company into, another corporation or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the conveyance or transfer of its property as an entirety, or substantially as an entirety, to another corporation upon the terms and conditions provided for in Article VIII shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section 14.3 if such other corporation shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions stated in Article VIII. Nothing in Section 14.2 or in this Section 14.3 shall apply to-claims of, or payments to the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 6.7. Section 14.4. Subrogation. Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, the rights of the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of such indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company, as the case may be, applicable to such Senior Indebtedness until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities shall be paid in full; and, for the purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article Fourteen, and no payment over pursuant to the provisions of this Article Fourteen to or for the benefit of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness by Holders of the Securities or the Trustee, shall, as between the Company, its creditors other than Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and the holders of the Securities, be deemed to be a payment by the Company to or on account of such Senior Indebtedness. It is understood that the provisions of this Article Fourteen are and are intended solely for the purposes of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities, on the one hand, and the holders of such Senior Indebtedness on the other hand. Nothing contained in this Article Fourteen or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities is intended to or shall impair, as between the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and the Holders of the Securities, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders of the Securities the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities and creditors of the Company, as the case may be, other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Security from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under the Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article Fourteen of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company, as the case may be, received upon the exercise of any such remedy. 75
Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article Fourteen, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, and the Holders of the Securities shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending, or a certificate of the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidation trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of the Securities, for the purposes of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article Fourteen. Section 14.5. Trustee to Effectuate Subordination. Each Holder of Securities by such Holder's acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on such Holder's behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in this Article Fourteen and appoints the Trustee such Holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Section 14.6. Notice by the Company. The Company shall give prompt written notice to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities pursuant to the provisions of this Article Fourteen. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article Fourteen or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities pursuant to the provisions of this Article Fourteen, unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or a holder or holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or from any trustee therefor; and before the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1 shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts exist; provided, however, that if the Trustee shall not have received the notice provided for in this Section 14.6 at least three Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any money may become payable for any purpose (including, without limitation, the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security), then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive such money and to apply the same to the purposes for which they were received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it within three Business Days prior to such date. The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be (or a trustee on behalf of such holder), to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of such Senior Indebtedness or a trustee on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that 76
the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of such Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Fourteen, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article Fourteen, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. Section 14.7. Rights of the Trustee; Holders of Senior Indebtedness. The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article Fourteen in respect of any Senior Indebtedness at any time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder. With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article Fourteen, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, the Trustee shall not be liable to any holder of such Senior Indebtedness if it shall pay over or deliver to Holders of Securities, the Company or any other Person money or assets to which any holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Fourteen or otherwise. Section 14.8. Subordination May Not Be Impaired. No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company, as the case may be, or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company, as the case may be, with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder may have or otherwise be charged with. Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities, without incurring responsibility to the Holders of the Securities and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article Fourteen or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Securities to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, such Senior Indebtedness, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner such Senior Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the 77
same or any agreement under which such Senior Indebtedness is outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing such Senior Indebtedness; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of such Senior Indebtedness; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company, as the case may be, and any other Person. Section 14.9. Trustee's Compensation Not Prejudiced. Nothing in this Article Fourteen shall apply to amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to Section 6.7 of this Indenture. Section 14.10. Disclaimer of Right to Enforce Covenants. Except as specifically provided for in this Article 14, no holder of Senior Indebtedness shall have any right to enforce any of the covenants in this Indenture, including but not limited to those contained in Sections 5.11, 13.4, 13.5, 13.6, 13.7 and 13.8 ARTICLE XV MISCELLANEOUS Section 15.1. Acknowledgement of Rights. The Company acknowledges that, with respect to any Securities held by a Citigroup Trust or a trustee of such Trust, if the Institutional Trustee of such Citigroup Trust fails to enforce its rights under this Indenture as the Holder of the series of Securities held as the assets of such Citigroup Trust, any holder of Preferred Securities of such Citigroup Trust may institute legal proceedings directly against the Company to enforce such Institutional Trustee's rights under this Indenture without first instituting any legal proceedings against such Institutional Trustee or any other person or entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Default has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Company to pay interest or principal on the applicable series of Securities on the date such interest or principal is otherwise payable (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), the Company acknowledges that a holder of Trust Securities issued by the Citigroup Trust which is, or the Institutional Trustee of which is, the Holder of such Securities may directly institute a proceeding for enforcement of payment to such holder of the principal of or interest on the applicable series of Securities having a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Trust Securities of such holder (a "Direct Action") on or after the respective due date specified of such holder on or after the respective due date specified in the applicable series of Securities. Notwithstanding any payments made to such holder of Trust Securities by the Company in connection with a Direct Action, the Company shall remain obligated to pay the principal of or interest on the series of Securities held by a Citigroup Trust or the Institutional Trustee of a Citigroup Trust, and the Company shall 78
be subrogated to the rights of the holder of such Trust Securities to the extent of any payments made by the Company to such holder in any Direct Action. * * * * This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. 79

(c) A waiver of a Default under the Indenture by the Institutional Trustee at the direction of the Holders of the Capital Securities, constitutes a waiver of the corresponding Default under this Declaration. The foregoing provisions of this Section 2.6(c) shall be in lieu of Section 316(a)(1)(B) of the Trust Indenture Act and such Section 316(a)(1)(B) of the Trust Indenture Act is hereby expressly excluded from this Declaration and the Securities, as permitted by the Trust Indenture Act.

of the giving of any notice provided therein) and (ii) any notice of default received from the Indenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures, which notice from the Institutional Trustee to the Holders shall state that a Default under the Indenture also constitutes a Default with respect to the Securities; provided that, except for a default in the payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any of the Debentures or in the payment of any sinking fund installment established for the Debentures, the Institutional Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a Responsible Officer of the Institutional Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Holders of the Securities.

the Trustee and delivered to the Sponsor and the Trust, which resignation shall take effect upon such delivery or upon such later date as is specified therein; provided, however, that: (i) No such resignation of the Trustee that acts as the Institutional Trustee shall be effective: (A) until a Successor Institutional Trustee has been appointed and has accepted such appointment by instrument executed by such Successor Institutional Trustee and delivered to the Trust, the Sponsor and the resigning Institutional Trustee; or (B) until the assets of the Trust have been completely liquidated and the proceeds thereof distributed to the holders of the Securities; and (ii) no such resignation of the Trustee that acts as the Delaware Trustee shall be effective until a Successor Delaware Trustee has been appointed and has accepted such appointment by instrument executed by such Successor Delaware Trustee and delivered to the Trust, the Sponsor and the resigning Delaware Trustee. (d) The Holders of the Common Securities shall use their best efforts to promptly appoint a Successor Delaware Trustee or Successor Institutional Trustee as the case may be if the Institutional Trustee or the Delaware Trustee delivers an instrument of resignation in accordance with this Section 5.6. (e) If no Successor Institutional Trustee or Successor Delaware Trustee shall have been appointed and accepted appointment as provided in this Section 5.6 within 60 days after delivery to the Sponsor and the Trust of an instrument of resignation, the resigning Institutional Trustee or Delaware Trustee, as applicable, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for appointment of a Successor Institutional Trustee or Successor Delaware Trustee. Such court may thereupon, after prescribing such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a Successor Institutional Trustee or Successor Delaware Trustee, as the case may be. (f) No Institutional Trustee or Delaware Trustee shall be liable for the acts or omissions to act of any Successor Institutional Trustee or Successor Delaware Trustee, as the case may be. SECTION 5.7 Vacancies among Trustees. If a Trustee ceases to hold office for any reason and the number of Trustees is not reduced pursuant to Section 5.1, or if the number of Trustees is increased pursuant to Section 5.1, a vacancy shall occur. A resolution certifying the existence of such vacancy by the Regular Trustees or, if there are more than two, a majority of the Regular Trustees shall be conclusive evidence of the existence of such vacancy. The vacancy shall be filled with a Trustee appointed in accordance with Section 5.6. SECTION 5.8 Effect of Vacancies. 26
The death, resignation, retirement, removal, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation, incompetence or incapacity to perform the duties of a Trustee shall not operate to annul the Trust. Whenever a vacancy in the number of Regular Trustees shall occur, until such vacancy is filled by the appointment of a Regular Trustee in accordance with Section 5.6, the Regular Trustees in office, regardless of their number, shall have all the powers granted to the Regular Trustees and shall discharge all the duties imposed upon the Regular Trustees by this Declaration. SECTION 5.9 Meetings. If there is more than one Regular Trustee, meetings of the Regular Trustees shall be held from time to time upon the call of any Regular Trustee. Regular meetings of the Regular Trustees may be held at a time and place fixed by resolution of the Regular Trustees. Notice of any in-person meetings of the Regular Trustees shall be hand delivered or otherwise delivered in writing (including by facsimile, with a hard copy by overnight courier) not less than 48 hours before such meeting. Notice of any telephonic meetings of the Regular Trustees or any committee thereof shall be hand delivered or otherwise delivered in writing (including by facsimile, with a hard copy by overnight courier) not less than 24 hours before a meeting. Notices shall contain a brief statement of the time, place and anticipated purposes of the meeting. The presence (whether in person or by telephone) of a Regular Trustee at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting except where a Regular Trustee attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any activity on the ground that the meeting has not been lawfully called or convened. Unless provided otherwise in this Declaration, any action of the Regular Trustees may be taken at a meeting by vote of a majority of the Regular Trustees present (whether in person or by telephone) and eligible to vote with respect to such matter, provided that a Quorum is present, or without a meeting by the unanimous written consent of the Regular Trustees. In the event there is only one Regular Trustee, any and all action of such Regular Trustee shall be evidenced by a written consent of such Regular Trustee. SECTION 5.10 Delegation of Power. (a) Any Regular Trustee may, by power of attorney consistent with applicable law, delegate to any other natural person over the age of 21 his or her power for the purpose of executing any documents contemplated in Section 3.6, including any registration statement or amendment thereto filed with the Commission, or making any other governmental filing; and (b) the Regular Trustees shall have power to delegate from time to time to such of their number or to officers of the Trust the doing of such things and the execution of such instruments either in the name of the Trust or the names of the Regular Trustees or otherwise as the Regular Trustees may deem expedient, to the extent such delegation is not prohibited by applicable law or contrary to the provisions of the Trust, as set forth herein. SECTION 5.11 Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business. Any corporation into which the Institutional Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, may be merged or converted or with which either may be consolidated, or any 27
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Institutional Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Institutional Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, shall be the successor of the Institutional Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. ARTICLE VI DISTRIBUTIONS SECTION 6.1 Distributions. Holders shall receive Distributions (as defined herein) in accordance with the applicable terms of the relevant Holder's Securities. Distributions shall be made on the Capital Securities and the Common Securities in accordance with the preferences set forth in their respective terms. If and to the extent that the Debenture Issuer makes a payment of interest (including Compounded Interest (as defined in the Indenture) and Additional Interest (as defined in the Indenture)), premium and/or principal on the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee (the amount of any such payment being a "Payment Amount"), the Institutional Trustee shall and is directed to make a distribution (a "Distribution") of the Payment Amount to Holders. ARTICLE VII ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES SECTION 7.1 General Provisions Regarding Securities. (a) The Regular Trustees shall on behalf of the Trust issue one class of capital securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust having such terms as are set forth in Annex I (the "Capital Securities") and one class of common securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust having such terms as are set forth in Annex I (the "Common Securities"). The Trust shall issue no securities or other interests in the assets of the Trust other than the Capital Securities and the Common Securities. (b) The Certificates shall be signed on behalf of the Trust by a Regular Trustee. Such signature shall be the manual or facsimile signature of any present or any future Regular Trustee. In case any Regular Trustee of the Trust who shall have signed any of the Securities shall cease to be such Regular Trustee before the Certificates so signed shall be delivered by the Trust, such Certificates nevertheless may be delivered as though the person who signed such Certificates had not ceased to be such Regular Trustee; and any Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Trust by such persons who, at the actual date of execution of such Security, shall be the Regular Trustees of the Trust, although at the date of the execution and delivery of the Declaration any such person was not such a Regular Trustee. Certificates shall be printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Regular Trustees, as evidenced by their execution thereof, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements as the Regular Trustees may deem appropriate, or as may be required to comply with any law or 28
with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which Securities may be listed, or to conform to usage. (c) The consideration received by the Trust for the issuance of the Securities shall constitute a contribution to the capital of the Trust and shall not constitute a loan to the Trust. (d) Upon issuance of the Securities as provided in this Declaration, the Securities so issued shall be deemed to be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. (e) Every Person, by virtue of having become a Holder or a Capital Security Beneficial Owner in accordance with the terms of this Declaration, shall be deemed to have expressly assented and agreed to the terms of, and shall be bound by, this Declaration. ARTICLE VIII TERMINATION OF TRUST SECTION 8.1 Termination of Trust. (a) The Trust shall terminate: (i) upon the bankruptcy of any Holder of the Common Securities or the Sponsor; (ii) upon the filing of a certificate of dissolution or its equivalent with respect to any Holder of the Common Securities or the Sponsor; the filing of a certificate of cancellation with respect to the Trust or the revocation of the Holder of the Common Securities or the Sponsor's charter and the expiration of 90 days after the date of revocation without a reinstatement thereof; (iii) upon the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of any Holder of the Common Securities, the Sponsor or the Trust; (iv) Subject to obtaining any required regulatory approval, when all of the Securities have been called for redemption and the amounts necessary for redemption thereof have been paid to the Holders in accordance with the terms of the Securities; (v) Subject to obtaining any required regulatory approval, when the Trust shall have been dissolved in accordance with the terms of the Securities upon election by the Sponsor of its right to terminate the Trust and distribute all of the Debentures to the Holders of Securities in exchange for all of the Securities and all of the Debentures shall have been distributed to the Holders of Securities in accordance with such election; (vi) before the issuance of any Securities, with the consent of all of the Regular Trustees and the Sponsor; or (vii) upon the expiration of the term of the Trust set forth in Section 3.14. 29
(b) As soon as is practicable after the occurrence of an event referred to in Section 8.1(a), and after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as required by applicable law, including Section 3808 of the Statutory Trust Act, and subject to the terms set forth in Annex I, the Delaware Trustee, when notified in writing of the completion of the winding up of the Trust in accordance with the Statutory Trust Act, shall terminate the Trust by filing, at the expense of the Sponsor, a certificate of cancellation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. (c) The provisions of Section 3.9 and Article X shall survive the termination of the Trust. ARTICLE IX TRANSFER OF INTERESTS SECTION 9.1 Transfer of Securities. (a) Securities may only be transferred, in whole or in part, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Declaration and in the terms of the Securities. Any transfer or purported transfer of any Security not made in accordance with this Declaration shall be null and void. (b) Subject to this Article IX, Capital Securities shall be freely transferable. (c) Subject to this Article IX, the Sponsor and any Related Party may only transfer Common Securities to the Sponsor or a Related Party of the Sponsor; provided, that any such transfer is subject to the condition precedent that the transferor obtain the written opinion of nationally recognized independent counsel experienced in such matters that such transfer would not cause more than an insubstantial risk that: (i) the Trust would not be classified for United States federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust; and (ii) the Trust would be an Investment Company or the transferee would become an Investment Company. SECTION 9.2 Transfer of Certificates. The Regular Trustees shall provide for the registration of Certificates and of transfers of Certificates, which will be effected without charge but only upon payment (with such indemnity as the Regular Trustees may require) in respect of any tax or other government charges that may be imposed in relation to it. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Certificate, the Regular Trustees shall cause one or more new Certificates to be issued in the name of the designated transferee or transferees. Every Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Regular Trustees duly executed by the Holder or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing. Each Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer shall be canceled by the Regular Trustees. A transferee of a Certificate shall be entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations 30
of a Holder hereunder upon the receipt by such transferee of a Certificate. By acceptance of a Certificate, each transferee shall be deemed to have agreed to be bound by this Declaration. SECTION 9.3 Deemed Security Holders. The Trustees may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate shall be registered on the books and records of the Trust as the sole holder of such Certificate and of the Securities represented by such Certificate for purposes of receiving Distributions and for all other purposes whatsoever and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such Certificate or in the Securities represented by such Certificate on the part of any Person, whether or not the Trust shall have actual or other notice thereof. SECTION 9.4 Book Entry Interests. Unless otherwise specified in the terms of the Capital Securities, the Capital Securities Certificates, on original issuance, will be issued in the form of one or more, fully registered, global Capital Security Certificates (each a "Global Certificate"), to be delivered to DTC, the initial Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf of, the Trust. Such Global Certificates shall initially be registered on the books and records of the Trust in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of DTC, and no Capital Security Beneficial Owner will receive a definitive Capital Security Certificate representing such Capital Security Beneficial Owner's interests in such Global Certificates, except as provided in Section 9.7. Unless and until definitive, fully registered Capital Security Certificates (the "Definitive Capital Security Certificates") have been issued to the Capital Security Beneficial Owners pursuant to Section 9.7: (a) the provisions of this Section 9.4 shall be in full force and effect; (b) the Trust and the Trustees shall be entitled to deal with the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Declaration (including the payment of Distributions on the Global Certificates and receiving approvals, votes or consents hereunder) as the Holder of the Capital Securities and the sole holder of the Global Certificates and shall have no obligation to the Capital Security Beneficial Owners; (c) to the extent that the provisions of this Section 9.4 conflict with any other provisions of this Declaration, the provisions of this Section 9.4 shall control; and (d) the rights of the Capital Security Beneficial Owners shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Capital Security Beneficial Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the Clearing Agency Participants and receive and transmit payments of Distributions on the Global Certificates to such Clearing Agency Participants. DTC will make book entry transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants. SECTION 9.5 Notices to Clearing Agency. Whenever a notice or other communication to the Capital Security Holders is required under this Declaration, unless and until Definitive Capital Security Certificates shall have been issued to the Capital Security Beneficial Owners pursuant to Section 9.7, the Regular 31
Trustees shall give all such notices and communications specified herein to be given to the Capital Security Holders to the Clearing Agency, and shall have no notice obligations to the Capital Security Beneficial Owners. SECTION 9.6 Appointment of Successor Clearing Agency. If any Clearing Agency elects to discontinue its services as a securities depositary with respect to the Capital Securities, the Regular Trustees may, in their sole discretion, appoint a successor Clearing Agency with respect to such Capital Securities. SECTION 9.7 Definitive Capital Security Certificates. If: (a) a Clearing Agency elects to discontinue its services as a securities depositary with respect to the Capital Securities and a successor Clearing Agency is not appointed within 90 days after such discontinuance pursuant to Section 9.6; or (b) the Regular Trustees elect after consultation with the Sponsor to terminate the book entry system through the Clearing Agency with respect to the Capital Securities, then: (c) Definitive Capital Security Certificates shall be prepared by the Regular Trustees on behalf of the Trust with respect to such Capital Securities; and (d) upon surrender of the Global Certificates by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the Regular Trustees shall cause Definitive Certificates to be delivered to Capital Security Beneficial Owners in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency. Neither the Trustees nor the Trust shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and each of them may conclusively rely on and shall be protected in relying on, said instructions of the Clearing Agency. The Definitive Capital Security Certificates shall be printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Regular Trustees, as evidenced by their execution thereof, and may have such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements as the Regular Trustees may deem appropriate, or as may be required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which Capital Securities may be listed, or to conform to usage. SECTION 9.8 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates. If: (a) any mutilated Certificates should be surrendered to the Regular Trustees, or if the Regular Trustees shall receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate; and 32
(b) there shall be delivered to the Regular Trustees such security or indemnity as may be required by them to keep each of them harmless. then, in the absence of notice that such Certificate shall have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, any Regular Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall execute and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 9.8, the Regular Trustees may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an ownership interest in the relevant Securities, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time. ARTICLE X LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF HOLDERS OF SECURITIES, TRUSTEES OR OTHERS SECTION 10.1 Liability. (a) Except as expressly set forth in this Declaration, the Capital Securities Guarantee and the terms of the Securities, the Sponsor shall not be: (i) personally liable for the return of any portion of the capital contributions (or any return thereon) of the Holders of the Securities which shall be made solely from assets of the Trust; and (ii) required to pay to the Trust or to any Holder of Securities any deficit upon dissolution of the Trust or otherwise. (b) The Holder of the Common Securities shall be liable for all of the debts and obligations of the Trust (other than with respect to the Securities) to the extent not satisfied out of the Trust's assets. (c) Pursuant to Section 3803(a) of the Statutory Trust Act, the Holders of the Capital Securities shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. SECTION 10.2 Exculpation. (a) No Indemnified Person shall be liable, responsible or accountable in damages or otherwise to the Trust or any Covered Person for any loss, damage or claim incurred by reason of any act or omission performed or omitted by such Indemnified Person in good faith on behalf of the Trust and in a manner such Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be within the scope of the authority conferred on such Indemnified Person by this Declaration or by law, except that an Indemnified Person shall be liable for any such loss, damage or claim incurred by reason of such Indemnified Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct with respect to such acts or omissions. 33
(b) An Indemnified Person shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the Trust and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Trust by any Person as to matters the Indemnified Person reasonably believes are within such other Person's professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Trust, including information, opinions, reports or statements as to the value and amount of the assets, liabilities, profits, losses, or any other facts pertinent to the existence and amount of assets from which Distributions to Holders of Securities might properly be paid. SECTION 10.3 Fiduciary Duty. (a) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnified Person has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Trust or to any other Covered Person, an Indemnified Person acting under this Declaration shall not be liable to the Trust or to any other Covered Person for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Declaration. The provisions of this Declaration, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of an Indemnified Person otherwise existing at law or in equity (other than the duties imposed on the Institutional Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act), are agreed by the parties hereto to replace such other duties and liabilities of such Indemnified Person. (b) Unless otherwise expressly provided herein: (i) whenever a conflict of interest exists or arises between any Covered Persons; or (ii) whenever this Declaration or any other agreement contemplated herein or therein provides that an Indemnified Person shall act in a manner that is, or provides terms that are, fair and reasonable to the Trust or any Holder of Securities, the Indemnified Person shall resolve such conflict of interest, take such action or provide such terms, considering in each case the relative interest of each party (including its own interest) to such conflict, agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interests, any customary or accepted industry practices, and any applicable generally accepted accounting practices or principles. In the absence of bad faith by the Indemnified Person, the resolution, action or term so made, taken or provided by the Indemnified Person shall not constitute a breach of this Declaration or any other agreement contemplated herein or of any duty or obligation of the Indemnified Person at law or in equity or otherwise. (c) Whenever in this Declaration an Indemnified Person is permitted or required to make a decision: (i) in its "discretion" or under a grant of similar authority, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to consider such interests and factors as it desires, including its own interests, and shall have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting the Trust or any other Person; or 34
(ii) in its "good faith" or under another express standard, the Indemnified Person shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by this Declaration or by applicable law. SECTION 10.4 Indemnification. (a) (i) The Debenture Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Trust) by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Company Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. (ii) The Debenture Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Trust to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust and except that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Company Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. (iii) To the extent that a Company Indemnified Person shall be successful on the merits or otherwise (including dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action without admission of liability) in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified, to the full extent permitted by law, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. (iv) Any indemnification under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Debenture Issuer only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Company Indemnified 35
Person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii). Such determination shall be made (1) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of such Regular Trustees who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the Common Security Holder of the Trust. (v) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Company Indemnified Person in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) shall be paid by the Debenture Issuer in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Company Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Debenture Issuer as authorized in this Section 10.4(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Debenture Issuer if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees, (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iii) the Common Security Holder of the Trust, that, based upon the facts known to the Regular Trustees, counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time such determination is made, such Company Indemnified Person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Company Indemnified Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Regular Trustees, independent legal counsel or Common Security Holder reasonably determine that such person deliberately breached his duty to the Trust or its Common or Capital Security Holders. (vi) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 10.4(a) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors of the Debenture Issuer or Capital Security Holders of the Trust or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. All rights to indemnification under this Section 10.4(a) shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the Debenture Issuer and each Company Indemnified Person who serves in such capacity at any time while this Section 10.4(a) is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Section 10.4(a) shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing. (vii) The Debenture Issuer may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Company Indemnified Person against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Debenture Issuer would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a). 36
(viii) For purposes of this Section 10.4(a), references to "the Trust" shall include, in addition to the resulting or surviving entity, any constituent entity (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger, so that any person who is or was a director, trustee, officer or employee of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another entity, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a) with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as he would have with respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued. (ix) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 10.4(a) shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Company Indemnified Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. (b) The Debenture Issuer agrees to indemnify the (i) Institutional Trustee, (ii) the Delaware Trustee, (iii) any Affiliate of the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, and (iv) any officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, employees, representatives, custodians, nominees or agents of the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee (each of the Persons in (i) through (iv) being referred to as a "Fiduciary Indemnified Person") for, and to hold each Fiduciary Indemnified Person harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration or the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of defending itself against or investigating any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The obligation to indemnify as set forth in this Section 10.4(b) shall survive the resignation or removal of the Institutional Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, and the satisfaction and discharge of this Declaration. SECTION 10.5 Outside Businesses. Any Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee and the Institutional Trustee may engage in or possess an interest in other business ventures of any nature or description, independently or with others, similar or dissimilar to the business of the Trust, and the Trust and the Holders of Securities shall have no rights by virtue of this Declaration in and to such independent ventures or the income or profits derived therefrom, and the pursuit of any such venture, even if competitive with the business of the Trust, shall not be deemed wrongful or improper. No Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee, or the Institutional Trustee shall be obligated to present any particular investment or other opportunity to the Trust even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Trust, could be taken by the Trust, and any Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee and the Institutional Trustee shall have the right to take for its own account (individually or as a partner or fiduciary) or to recommend to others any such particular investment or other opportunity. Any Covered Person, the Delaware Trustee and the Institutional Trustee may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor, or may act as depositary for, trustee or agent for, or act on any committee or body of holders of, securities or other obligations of the Sponsor or its Affiliates. 37
ARTICLE XI ACCOUNTING SECTION 11.1 Fiscal Year. The fiscal year ("Fiscal Year") of the Trust shall be the calendar year, or such other year as is required by the Code. SECTION 11.2 Certain Accounting Matters. (a) At all times during the existence of the Trust, the Regular Trustees shall keep, or cause to be kept, full books of account, records and supporting documents, which shall reflect in reasonable detail, each transaction of the Trust. The books of account shall be maintained on the accrual method of accounting, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied. The Trust shall use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. The books of account and the records of the Trust shall be examined by and reported upon as of the end of each Fiscal Year of the Trust by a firm of independent certified public accountants selected by the Regular Trustees. (b) The Regular Trustees shall cause to be prepared and delivered to each of the Holders of Securities, to the extent, if any, required by the Trust Indenture Act, within 90 days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the Trust, annual financial statements of the Trust, including a balance sheet of the Trust as of the end of such Fiscal Year, and the related statements of income or loss; (c) The Regular Trustees shall cause to be duly prepared and delivered to each of the Holders of Securities, any annual United States federal income tax information statement required by the Code, containing such information with regard to the Securities held by each Holder as is required by the Code and the Treasury Regulations. Notwithstanding any right under the Code to deliver any such statement at a later date, the Regular Trustees shall endeavor to deliver all such statements within 30 days after the end of each Fiscal Year of the Trust. (d) The Regular Trustees shall cause to be duly prepared and filed with the appropriate taxing authority, an annual United States federal income tax return, on a Form 1041 or such other form required by United States federal income tax law, and any other annual income tax returns required to be filed by the Regular Trustees on behalf of the Trust with any state or local taxing authority. SECTION 11.3 Banking. The Trust shall maintain one or more bank accounts in the name and for the sole benefit of the Trust; provided, however, that all payments of funds in respect of the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee shall be made directly to the Institutional Trustee Account and no other funds of the Trust shall be deposited in the Institutional Trustee Account. The sole signatories for such accounts shall be designated by the Regular Trustees; provided, however, that the Institutional Trustee shall designate the signatories for the Institutional Trustee Account. SECTION 11.4 Withholding. 38
The Trust and the Regular Trustees shall comply with all withholding requirements under United States federal, state and local law. The Trust shall request, and the Holders shall provide to the Trust, such forms or certificates as are necessary to establish an exemption from withholding with respect to each Holder, and any representations and forms as shall reasonably be requested by the Trust to assist it in determining the extent of, and in fulfilling, its withholding obligations. The Regular Trustees shall file required forms with applicable jurisdictions and, unless an exemption from withholding is properly established by a Holder, shall remit amounts withheld with respect to the Holder to applicable jurisdictions. To the extent that the Trust is required to withhold and pay over any amounts to any authority with respect to distributions or allocations to any Holder, the amount withheld shall be deemed to be a distribution in the amount of the withholding to the Holder. In the event of any claimed overwithholding, Holders shall be limited to an action against the applicable jurisdiction. If the amount required to be withheld was not withheld from actual Distributions made, the Trust may reduce subsequent Distributions by the amount of such withholding.

The Regular Trustees shall call a meeting of the Holders of such class if directed to do so by the Holders of Securities representing at least 10% in liquidation amount of such class of Securities. Such direction shall be given by delivering to the Regular Trustees one or more calls in a writing stating that the signing Holders of Securities wish to call a meeting and indicating the general or specific purpose for which the meeting is to be called. Any Holders of Securities calling a meeting shall specify in writing the Security Certificates held by the Holders of Securities exercising the right to call a meeting and only those Securities specified shall be counted for purposes of determining whether the required percentage set forth in the second sentence of this paragraph has been met. (b) Except to the extent otherwise provided in the terms of the Securities, the following provisions shall apply to meetings of Holders of Securities: (i) notice of any such meeting shall be given to all the Holders of Securities having a right to vote thereat at least 7 days and not more than 60 days before the date of such meeting.

Prompt notice of the taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Holders of Securities entitled to vote who have not consented in writing.

No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the Holder of Securities executing it. Except as otherwise provided herein, all matters relating to the giving, voting or validity of proxies shall be governed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware relating to proxies, and judicial interpretations thereunder, as if the 41

ANNEX I TERMS OF 6.875% CAPITAL SECURITIES 6.875% COMMON SECURITIES Pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, dated as of June 30, 2006 (as amended from time to time, the "Declaration"), the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions, preferences and other terms and provisions of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities are set out below (each capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning set forth in the Declaration or, if not defined in such Declaration, as defined in the Prospectus referred to below): 1. Designation and Number. (a) Capital Securities. 20,000,000 Capital Securities of the Trust with an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of FIVE HUNDRED MILLION dollars ($500,000,000), and a liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of $25 per capital security, are hereby designated for the purposes of identification only as "6.875% Capital Securities" (the "Capital Securities"). The Capital Security Certificates evidencing the Capital Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice or to conform to the rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are listed. (b) Common Securities. 40,000 Common Securities of the Trust with an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of ONE MILLION dollars ($1,000,000), and a liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of $25 per common security, are hereby designated for the purposes of identification only as "6.875% Common Securities" (the "Common Securities"). The Common Security Certificates evidencing the Common Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice. 2. Distributions. (a) Distributions payable on each Security will be fixed at a rate per annum of 6.875% (the "Coupon Rate") of the stated liquidation amount of $25 per Security, such rate being the rate of interest payable on the Debentures to be held by the Institutional Trustee. Distributions in arrears beyond the first date such Distributions are payable (or would be payable, if not for any Extension Period (as defined below) or default by the Debenture Issuer on the Debentures) will bear interest thereon compounded quarterly at the Coupon Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law). The term "Distributions" as used herein includes such cash distributions and any such interest payable unless otherwise stated. A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee and to the extent the Institutional Trustee has funds available therefor. The amount of Distributions payable for any period will be computed for any full quarterly Distribution period I-1
on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and for any period shorter than a full quarterly Distribution period for which Distributions are computed, Distributions will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed per 90-day quarter. (b) Distributions on the Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from and including June 30, 2006, and will be payable quarterly in arrears, on March 30, June 30, September 30, and December 30 of each year, commencing on September 30, 2006. When, as and if available for payment, Distributions will be made by the Institutional Trustee, except as otherwise described below. The Debenture Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Debentures by extending the interest payment period from time to time on the Debentures for a period not exceeding 40 consecutive quarters (each an "Extension Period"), during which Extension Period no interest shall be due and payable on the Debentures, provided, that no Extension Period may extend beyond the date of maturity of the Debentures. As a consequence of the Debenture Issuer's extension of the interest payment period, quarterly Distributions will also be deferred. Despite such deferral, quarterly Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate compounded quarterly during any such Extension Period. In the event that the Debenture Issuer exercises its right to extend the interest payment period, then (a) the Debenture Issuer shall not declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto (other than (i) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, (ii) repurchases of shares of common stock of Citigroup pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the extension period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan (iii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Company's capital stock for any other class or series of the Company's capital stock, (iv) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged), or (v) the purchase of Citigroup's capital stock in connection with the distribution thereof; and (b) the Debenture Issuer shall not make any payment of interest on or principal of (or premium, if any, on), or repay, repurchase or redeem, any debt securities or guarantees issued by the Debenture Issuer that rank pari passu with or junior to the Debentures. The foregoing, however, will not apply to any stock dividends paid by Citigroup where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid. Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Debenture Issuer may further extend such Extension Period; provided, that such Extension Period, together with all such previous and further extensions thereof, may not exceed 40 consecutive quarters; provided further, that no Extension Period may extend beyond the maturity of the Debentures. In addition, if an Extension Period continues beyond the fifth anniversary thereof, until the tenth anniversary thereof, the Debenture Issuer may not pay on any Interest Payment Date interest that has accrued on the Debentures during the Quarterly Interest Accrual Period immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date unless all accrued and unpaid interest has been paid in full using the proceeds of the New Equity Amount (as such term is defined in the Indenture). Payments of deferred Distributions and accrued interest thereon will be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the first record date before the end of the Extension Period. Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Debenture I-2
Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements. The Regular Trustees will give notice to each Holder of any Extension Period upon their receipt of notice thereof from the Debenture Issuer. (c) If the Debenture Issuer does not pay all accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures for a period of 20 consecutive quarterly periods, it will be obliged to continuously use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell shares of its common stock (including treasury shares) and/or, at its option, shares of its qualified preferred stock, which is stock that is (1) perpetual with no prepayment obligation on the part of the Debenture Issuer thereof, whether at the election of the holders or otherwise, and (2) distributions on which may be skipped by the Debenture Issuer thereof for any number of distribution periods without any remedy arising under the terms of such securities or related transaction agreements in favor of the holders of such securities as a result of the Debenture Issuer's failure to pay distributions, other than the right to appoint one or more members to the Debenture Issuer's board of directors. The Debenture Issuer will notify the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or its successor as the Debenture Issuer's primary federal banking regulator (collectively, the "Federal Reserve") upon (1) the commencement of any Extension Period, (2) the fifth anniversary of the commencement of an Extension Period and (3) following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of an Extension Period, of its intention to sell shares of its common stock and/or qualified preferred stock and to apply the net proceeds of such sale to pay deferred interest on the Debentures. The Debenture Issuer may pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures on or prior to the next interest payment date using only the net proceeds (after underwriters' or placement agents' fees, commissions or discounts and other expenses relating to the issuances) of such sales received by the Debenture Issuer during the 180-day period prior to that interest payment date, except that the Debenture Issuer may pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures with cash from any source (i) following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of an Extension Period, (ii) upon the maturity of the Debentures, (iii) during the occurrence and continuation of a Market Disruption Event or a Supervisory Event (each as defined in the Indenture), (iv) if the Debenture Issuer has previously sold shares of its common stock up to the Share Cap Amount (as defined below) and the Debenture Issuer has not increased the Share Cap Amount or (v) if an Event of Default and Acceleration under the Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing. Corresponding Distributions will be made on the Securities. If (1) a Supervisory Event or (2) a Market Disruption Event shall have occurred and be continuing; then the Debenture Issuer will be excused from its obligation to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell its common stock and apply the net proceeds of such sale to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures. During the occurrence of a Supervisory Event, the Debenture Issuer will, no later than 30 Business Days prior to each interest payment date, notify the Federal Reserve of its intention to both (1) issue or sell shares of common stock and (2) to apply the net proceeds from such sale to pay deferred interest on the Debentures, and shall only take any such actions if the Federal Reserve does not disapprove of any such actions within ten (10) Business Days after the Debenture Issuer gives such notice to the Federal Reserve. The obligation of the Debenture Issuer to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell its common stock and apply the net proceeds of such sale to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures shall resume at such time as no Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event exists or is continuing. The Debenture Issuer is not permitted to sell shares of common stock in excess of a number of shares of common stock which at June 30, 2006 is equal to 55,000,000 (the "Share Cap Amount"), for the I-3
purpose of using its commercially reasonable efforts to sell its common stock and apply the net proceeds of such sale to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures or otherwise paying deferred interest on the Debentures. If the issued and outstanding shares of common stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, then the Share Cap Amount shall be correspondingly adjusted. The Debenture Issuer may, at its discretion, increase the Share Cap Amount (including through the increase of its authorized share capital, if necessary) if the Debenture Issuer determines that such increase is necessary to allow it to issue sufficient shares to satisfy its obligations to pay deferred interest on the Securities. (d) Distributions on the Securities will be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the books and records of the Trust at the close of business on the relevant record dates. While the Capital Securities remain in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant payment dates which payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Debentures. Subject to any applicable laws and regulations and the provisions of the Declaration, each such payment in respect of the Capital Securities will be made as described under the heading "Description of the Capital Securities -- Book-Entry Only Issuance" in the Prospectus dated June 26, 2006 (the "Prospectus"), of the Trust included in the Registration Statement on Form S-3 of the Sponsor, the Trust and certain other statutory trusts. The relevant record dates for the Common Securities shall be the same record date as for the Capital Securities. If the Capital Securities shall not continue to remain in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates for the Capital Securities shall conform to the rules of any securities exchange on which the securities are listed and, if none, shall be selected by the Regular Trustees, which dates shall be more than 14 days but less than 60 days prior to the relevant payment dates, which payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Debentures. Distributions payable on any Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution payment date, as a result of the Debenture Issuer having failed to make a payment under the Debentures, will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date determined in accordance with the Indenture. If any date on which Distributions are payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date. (e) In the event that there is any money or other property held by or for the Trust that is not accounted for hereunder, such property shall be distributed Pro Rata (as defined herein) among the Holders of the Securities. 3. Liquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution. (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding-up or termination of the Trust, the Holders of the Securities on the date of the dissolution, winding-up or termination, as the case may be, will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust I-4
available for distribution to Holders of Securities after satisfaction of liabilities of creditors, distributions in an amount equal to the aggregate of the stated liquidation amount of $25 per Security plus accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"), unless, in connection with such dissolution, winding-up or termination, Debentures in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of, with an interest rate equal to the Coupon Rate, and bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Distributions on, such Securities outstanding at such time, have been distributed on a Pro Rata basis to the Holders of the Securities in exchange for such Securities. Prior to any such Liquidation Distribution, the Debenture Issuer will obtain any required regulatory approval. (b) If, upon any such dissolution, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then the amounts payable directly by the Trust on the Securities shall be paid on a Pro Rata basis. 4. Redemption and Distribution. (a) Upon the repayment of the Debentures in whole or in part, whether at maturity or upon redemption (either at the option of the Debenture Issuer or pursuant to a Special Event as described below), the proceeds from such repayment or payment shall be simultaneously applied to redeem Securities having an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures so repaid or redeemed at a redemption price of $25 per Security plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon at the date of the redemption, payable in cash (the "Redemption Price"). Holders shall be given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice of such redemption. Prior to any such redemption, the Debenture Issuer will obtain any required regulatory approval. (b) If fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be so redeemed, the Securities will be redeemed Pro Rata and the Capital Securities to be redeemed will be as described in Section 4(f)(ii) below. (c) Subject to obtaining any required regulatory approval, if, at any time, a Tax Event, an Investment Company Event or a Regulatory Capital Event (each as defined below, and each a "Special Event") shall occur and be continuing, Citigroup shall have the right, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, to redeem the Debentures, in whole or in part, for cash within 90 days following the occurrence of such Special Event, and, following such redemption, Securities with an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures so redeemed shall be redeemed by the Trust at the Redemption Price on a Pro Rata basis; provided, however, that if at the time there is available to Citigroup or the Trust the opportunity to eliminate, within such 90-day period, the Special Event by taking some ministerial action, such as filing a form or making an election or pursuing some other similar reasonable measure that will have no adverse effect on the Trust, Citigroup or the holders of the Securities, then Citigroup or the Trust will pursue such measure in lieu of redemption. "Tax Event" means that the Regular Trustees shall have received an opinion of a nationally recognized independent tax counsel experienced in such matters (a "Tax Event I-5
Opinion") to the effect that, as a result of (a) any amendment to, or change (including any announced prospective change) in, the laws (or any regulations thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein or (b) any amendment to, or change in, an interpretation or application of such laws or regulations by any legislative body, court, governmental agency or regulatory authority (including the enactment of any legislation and the publication of any judicial decision or regulatory determination on or after the date of the Prospectus), in either case after the date of the Prospectus, there is more than an insubstantial risk that (i) the Trust would be subject to United States federal income tax with respect to interest accrued or received on the Debentures, (ii) the Trust would be subject to more than a de minimis amount of other taxes, duties or other governmental charges, or (iii) interest payable to the Trust on the Debentures would not be deductible, in whole or in part, by the Debenture Issuer for United States federal income tax purposes. "Investment Company Event" means that the Regular Trustees shall have received an opinion of a nationally recognized independent counsel experienced in practice under the Investment Company Act (an "Investment Company Event Opinion") to the effect that, as a result of the occurrence of a change in law or regulation or a written change in interpretation or application of law or regulation by any legislative body, court, governmental agency or regulatory authority (a "Change in 1940 Act Law"), there is a more than an insubstantial risk that the Trust is or will be considered an Investment Company which is required to be registered under the Investment Company Act, which Change in 1940 Act Law becomes effective on or after the date of the Prospectus. "Regulatory Capital Event" means a determination by Citigroup, based on an opinion of counsel experienced in such matters (who may be an employee of Citigroup or any of its affiliates), that, as a result of (a) any amendment to, clarification of or change (including any announced prospective change) in applicable laws or regulations or official interpretations thereof or policies with respect thereto or (b) any official administrative pronouncement or judicial decision interpreting or applying such laws or regulations, which amendment, clarification, change, pronouncement or decision is announced or is effective after the date of the Prospectus, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Capital Securities will no longer constitute Tier I Capital of Citigroup or any bank holding company of which Citigroup is a subsidiary (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines or policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or its successor as Citigroup's primary federal banking regulator, provided, however that the distribution of the Debentures in connection with the liquidation of the Trust shall not in and of itself constitute a Regulatory Capital Event unless such liquidation shall have occurred in connection with a Tax Event or an Investment Company Event. On and from the date fixed by the Regular Trustees for any distribution of the Debentures and dissolution of the Trust: (i) the Securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding, (ii) DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), as the record Holder of the Capital Securities, will receive a registered global certificate or certificates representing the Debentures to be delivered upon such distribution and (iii) any certificates representing Securities, except for certificates representing Capital Securities held by DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), will be deemed to represent beneficial interests in the Debentures having an aggregate principal amount equal to the I-6
aggregate stated liquidation amount of, with an interest rate identical to the Coupon Rate of, and accrued and unpaid interest equal to accrued and unpaid Distributions on such Securities until such certificates are presented to the Debenture Issuer or its agent for transfer or reissue. (d) The Trust may not redeem fewer than all the outstanding Securities unless all accrued and unpaid Distributions have been paid on all Securities for all quarterly Distribution periods terminating on or before the date of redemption. (e) If the Debentures are distributed to the Holders of the Securities, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Debenture Issuer will use its best efforts to cause the Debentures to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or on such other exchange as the Capital Securities were listed immediately prior to the distribution of the Debentures. (f) Redemption or Distribution procedures will be as follows: (i) Notice of any redemption of, or notice of distribution of Debentures in exchange for the Securities (a "Redemption/Distribution Notice") will be given by the Trust by mail to the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee and to each Holder of the Securities to be redeemed or exchanged not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption or exchange thereof which, in the case of a redemption, will be the date fixed for redemption of the Debentures. For purposes of the calculation of the date of redemption or exchange and the dates on which notices are given pursuant to this Section 4(f)(i), a Redemption/ Distribution Notice shall be deemed to be given on the day such notice is first mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of the Securities. Each Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be addressed to the Holders of the Securities at the address of each such Holder appearing in the books and records of the Trust. No defect in the Redemption/Distribution Notice or in the mailing of either thereof with respect to any Holder shall affect the validity of the redemption or exchange proceedings with respect to any other Holder. (ii) In the event that fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be redeemed Pro Rata from each Holder of Capital Securities, it being understood that, in respect of Capital Securities registered in the name of and held of record by DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), the distribution of the proceeds of such redemption will be made to each Clearing Agency Participant (or Person on whose behalf such nominee holds such securities) in accordance with the procedures applied by such agency or nominee. (iii) If Securities are to be redeemed and the Trust gives a Redemption/Distribution Notice, which notice may only be issued if the Debentures are redeemed as set out in this Section 4 (which notice will be irrevocable), then (A) while the Capital Securities are in book-entry only form, with respect to the Capital Securities, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the redemption date, provided, that the Debenture Issuer has paid to the Institutional Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption or maturity of the Debentures, the Institutional Trustee will deposit irrevocably with DTC or its nominee (or successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to I-7
the Capital Securities and will give DTC (or any successor Clearing Agency) irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities, and (B) with respect to Capital Securities issued in definitive form and Common Securities, provided, that the Debenture Issuer has paid the Institutional Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption or maturity of the Debentures, the Institutional Trustee will pay the relevant Redemption Price to the Holders of such Securities by check mailed to the address of the relevant Holder appearing on the books and records of the Trust on the redemption date. If a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall have been given and funds deposited as required, if applicable, then immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such deposit, or on the redemption date, as applicable, distributions will cease to accrue on the Securities so called for redemption and all rights of the Holders of such Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of the Holders of such Securities to receive the Redemption Price, but without interest on such Redemption Price. Neither the Regular Trustees nor the Trust shall be required to register or cause to be registered the transfer of any Securities that have been so called for redemption. If any date fixed for redemption of Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Securities is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Institutional Trustee or by the Sponsor as guarantor pursuant to the relevant Securities Guarantee, Distributions on such Securities will continue to accrue from the original redemption date to the actual date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price. (iv) Redemption/Distribution Notices shall be sent by the Regular Trustees on behalf of the Trust to (A) in respect of the Capital Securities, DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) if the Global Certificates have been issued or, if Definitive Capital Security Certificates have been issued, to the Holder thereof and (B) in respect of the Common Securities to the Holder thereof. (v) Subject to the foregoing and applicable law (including, without limitation, United States federal securities laws), the Debenture Issuer or its affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase outstanding Capital Securities by tender, in the open market or by private agreement. 5. Voting Rights - Capital Securities. (a) Except as provided under Sections 5(b) and 7 and as otherwise required by law and the Declaration, the Holders of the Capital Securities will have no voting rights. (b) Subject to the requirements set forth in this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Securities, voting separately as a class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to I-8
the Institutional Trustee, or direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Institutional Trustee under the Declaration, including the right to direct the Institutional Trustee, as holder of the Debentures, to (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee, or exercise any trust or power conferred on the Debenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures, (ii) waive any past Default (as defined in the Indenture) that is waivable under Section 5.6 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due and payable or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Debentures where such consent shall be required; provided, however, that, where a consent or action under the Indenture would require the consent or act of each holder of each Debenture affected thereby, such consent or action under the Indenture shall not be effective until each Holder of Capital Securities shall have consented to such action or provided such consent. The Institutional Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities. Except with respect to directing the time, method and place of conducting a proceeding for a remedy available to the Institutional Trustee, the Institutional Trustee, as holder of the Debentures, shall not take any of the actions described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above unless the Institutional Trustee has obtained an opinion of a nationally recognized independent tax counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that as a result of such action, the Trust will not fail to be classified as a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes. If the Institutional Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Debentures, any Holder of Capital Securities may directly institute a legal proceeding against the Debenture Issuer to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Debentures without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Institutional Trustee or any other Person or entity. If a Default under the Declaration has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Debenture Issuer to pay interest or principal on the Debentures on the date such interest or principal is otherwise payable (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), then a holder of Capital Securities may also directly institute a proceeding for enforcement of payment to such holder (a "Direct Action") of the principal of or interest on the Debentures having a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Securities of such holder on or after the respective due date specified in the Debentures without first (i) directing the Institutional Trustee to enforce the terms of the Debentures or (ii) instituting a legal proceeding directly against the Debenture Issuer to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Debentures. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Holders of Capital Securities will not be able to exercise directly any other remedy available to the holders of the Debentures. In connection with such Direct Action, Citigroup will be subrogated to the rights of such Holder of Capital Securities under the Declaration to the extent of any payment made by Citigroup to such holder of Capital Securities in such Direct Action. Any required approval or direction of Holders of Capital Securities may be given at a separate meeting of Holders of Capital Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of Securities in the Trust or pursuant to written consent. The Regular Trustees will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of Capital Securities are entitled to vote, or of any matter upon which action by written consent of such Holders is to be taken, to be mailed to each Holder of record of Capital Securities. Each such notice will include a statement setting forth (i) the date of such meeting or the date by which such action is to be taken, (ii) a description of any resolution proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are I-9
entitled to vote or of such matter upon which written consent is sought and (iii) instructions for the delivery of proxies or consents. No vote or consent of the Holders of the Capital Securities will be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel Capital Securities or to distribute the Debentures in accordance with this Declaration and the terms of the Securities. Notwithstanding that Holders of Capital Securities are entitled to vote or consent under any of the circumstances described above, any of the Capital Securities that are owned by the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor shall not be entitled to vote or consent and shall, for purposes of such vote or consent, be treated as if they were not outstanding. 6. Voting Rights - Common Securities. (a) Except as provided under Sections 6(b), (c) and 7 as otherwise required by law and the Declaration, the Holders of the Common Securities will have no voting rights. (b) The Holders of the Common Securities are entitled, in accordance with and subject to Article V of the Declaration, to vote to appoint, remove or replace any Trustee or to increase or decrease the number of Trustees. (c) Subject to Section 2.6 of the Declaration and only after the Default with respect to the Capital Securities has been cured, waived, or otherwise eliminated and subject to the requirements of the second to last sentence of this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Common Securities, voting separately as a class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional Trustee, or direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Institutional Trustee under the Declaration, including (i) directing the time, method, place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Debenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures, (ii) waiving any past Default (as defined in the Indenture) that is waivable under Section 5.6 of the Indenture, or (iii) exercising any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due and payable, provided that, where a consent or action under the Indenture would require the consent or act of the Holders of greater than a majority in principal amount of Debentures affected thereby (a "Super Majority"), the Institutional Trustee may only give such consent or take such action at the written direction of the Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the Common Securities which the relevant Super Majority represents of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures outstanding. Pursuant to this Section 6(c), the Institutional Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities. Other than with respect to directing the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional Trustee or the Debenture Trustee as set forth above, the Institutional Trustee shall not take any action in accordance with the directions of the Holders of the Common Securities under this paragraph unless the Institutional Trustee has obtained an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that for the purposes of United States federal income tax the Trust will not be classified as other than a I-10
grantor trust on account of such action. If the Institutional Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Declaration, any Holder of Common Securities may institute a legal proceeding directly against any Person to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Declaration, without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Institutional Trustee or any other Person. Any approval or direction of Holders of Common Securities may be given at a separate meeting of Holders of Common Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of Securities in the Trust or pursuant to written consent. The Regular Trustees will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of Common Securities are entitled to vote, or of any matter upon which action by written consent of such Holders is to be taken, to be mailed to each Holder of record of Common Securities. Each such notice will include a statement setting forth (i) the date of such meeting or the date by which such action is to be taken, (ii) a description of any resolution proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote or of such matter upon which written consent is sought and (iii) instructions for the delivery of proxies or consents. No vote or consent of the Holders of the Common Securities will be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel Common Securities or to distribute the Debentures in accordance with the Declaration and the terms of the Securities. 7. Amendments to Declaration and Indenture. (a) In addition to any requirements under Section 12.1 of the Declaration, if any proposed amendment to the Declaration provides for, or the Regular Trustees otherwise propose to effect, (i) any action that would adversely affect the powers, preferences or special rights of the Securities, whether by way of amendment to the Declaration or otherwise, or (ii) the dissolution, winding-up or termination of the Trust, other than as described in Section 8.1 of the Declaration, then the Holders of outstanding Securities as a class, will be entitled to vote on such amendment or proposal (but not on any other amendment or proposal) and such amendment or proposal shall not be effective except with the approval of the Holders of at least a Majority in liquidation amount of the Securities, voting together as a single class; provided, however, if any amendment or proposal referred to in clause (i) above would adversely affect only the Capital Securities or only the Common Securities, then only the affected class will be entitled to vote on such amendment or proposal and such amendment or proposal shall not be effective except with the approval of a Majority in liquidation amount of such class of Securities. (b) In the event the consent of the Institutional Trustee as the holder of the Debentures is required under the Indenture with respect to any amendment, modification or termination on the Indenture or the Debentures, the Institutional Trustee shall request the written direction of the Holders of the Securities with respect to such amendment, modification or termination and shall vote with respect to such amendment, modification or termination as directed by a Majority in liquidation amount of the Securities voting together as a single class; provided, however, that where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent of the holders of greater than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures (a "Super Majority"), the Institutional Trustee may only give such consent at the direction of the Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the Securities which the relevant Super Majority represents of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures outstanding; provided, further, I-11
that the Institutional Trustee shall not take any action in accordance with the directions of the Holders of the Securities under this Section 7(b) unless the Institutional Trustee has obtained an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that for the purposes of United States federal income tax the Trust will not be classified as other than a grantor trust on account of such action. 8. Pro Rata. A reference in these terms of the Securities to any payment, distribution or treatment as being "Pro Rata" shall mean pro rata to each Holder of Securities according to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Securities held by the relevant Holder in relation to the aggregate liquidation amount of all Securities outstanding unless, in relation to a payment, an a Default under the Declaration has occurred and is continuing, in which case any funds available to make such payment shall be paid first to each Holder of the Capital Securities pro rata according to the aggregate liquidation amount of Capital Securities held by the relevant Holder relative to the aggregate liquidation amount of all Capital Securities outstanding, and only after satisfaction of all amounts owed to the Holders of the Capital Securities, to each Holder of Common Securities pro rata according to the aggregate liquidation amount of Common Securities held by the relevant Holder relative to the aggregate liquidation amount of all Common Securities outstanding. 9. Ranking. The Capital Securities rank pari passu and payment thereon shall be made Pro Rata with the Common Securities except that, where a Default (as defined in the Indenture) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture in respect of the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee, the rights of Holders of the Common Securities to payment in respect of Distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and otherwise are subordinated to the rights to payment of the Holders of the Capital Securities. 10. Listing. The Regular Trustees shall use their best efforts to cause the Capital Securities to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 11. Acceptance of Securities Guarantee and Indenture. Each Holder of Capital Securities and Common Securities, by the acceptance thereof, agrees to the provisions of the Capital Securities Guarantee, including the subordination provisions therein and to the provisions of the Indenture. 12. No Preemptive Rights. The Holders of the Securities shall have no preemptive rights to subscribe for any additional securities. 13. Miscellaneous. These terms constitute a part of the Declaration.

RECITALS A. On the date hereof, the Corporation is issuing $501,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.875% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due June 30, 2066 (the "Notes") to Citigroup Capital XIV, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"). B. On the date hereof, the Trust is issuing $500,000,000 aggregate liquidation amount of its 6.875% Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities (the "Enhanced TRUPS"(R)(1) and, together with the Notes, the "Securities"). C. This Capital Replacement Covenant is the "Capital Replacement Covenant" referred to in the Prospectus, dated June 26, 2006, relating to the Enhanced TRUPS. D. The Corporation is entering into this Capital Replacement Covenant and disclosing the content of this Capital Replacement Covenant in the manner provided below with the intent that the covenants provided for in this Capital Replacement Covenant be enforceable by each Covered Debtholder and that the Corporation be estopped from disregarding the covenants in this Capital Replacement Covenant, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. E. The Corporation acknowledges that reliance by each Covered Debtholder upon the covenants in this Capital Replacement Covenant is reasonable and foreseeable by the Corporation and that, were the Corporation to disregard its covenants in this Capital Replacement Covenant, each Covered Debtholder would have sustained an injury as a result of its reliance on such covenants. NOW, THEREFORE, the Corporation hereby covenants and agrees as follows in favor of and for the benefit of each Covered Debtholder. SECTION 1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used in this Capital Replacement Covenant (including the Recitals) have the meanings set forth in Schedule I hereto. SECTION 2. Limitation on Redemption and Repurchase of Notes. The Corporation hereby promises and covenants to, and for the benefit of, each Covered Debtholder that the Corporation shall not, and shall cause the Trust not to, redeem or repurchase all or any part of the Securities on or before the Termination Date except to the extent that (a) the total redemption or repurchase price therefor is equal to or less than the sum of (i) the Applicable Percentage of the aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Corporation or its Subsidiaries from Persons that are not Subsidiaries of the Corporation during the six (6) months prior to the - ---------- (1) TRUPS(R) is a registered service mark of Citigroup Global Markets Inc.

EXHIBIT 99.01 June 30, 2006 Citigroup Inc. 399 Park Avenue New York, NY 10043 Citigroup Capital XIV c/o Citigroup Inc. 399 Park Avenue New York, NY 10043 Re: Registration Statement on Form S-3 Ladies and Gentlemen: We have acted as special counsel to Citigroup Capital XIV, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"), and Citigroup Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the public offering by the Trust of 20,000,000 of its 6.875% enhanced trust preferred securities (liquidation amount $25 per capital security) (the "Capital Securities") and related issuance by the Company of $501,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.875% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due June 30, 2066 (the "Junior Subordinated Debt Securities "). This opinion is being furnished to you in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(8) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933. In connection with our opinion, we have examined and relied on originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the Registration Statement, the final prospectus dated June 26, 2006 (the "Prospectus") and such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein. We have also relied upon statements and representations made to us by representatives of the Company and the Trust and have assumed that such statements and the facts set forth in such representations are true, correct and complete without regard to any qualification as to knowledge or belief. For purposes of this opinion, we have assumed the validity and the initial and continuing accuracy of the documents, certificates, records, statements and representations referred to above. We have also assumed that the transactions related to the offering of the Capital Securities will be consummated in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus. 1
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic, electronic or facsimile copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. In making our examination of documents executed, or to be executed, by the parties indicated therein, we have assumed that each party has, or will have, the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder, and we have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by each party indicated in the documents and that such documents constitute, or will constitute, valid and binding obligations of each party. In rendering our opinion, we have considered the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury Department regulations promulgated thereunder, pertinent judicial authorities, interpretive rulings of the Internal Revenue Service and such other authorities as we have considered relevant. It should be noted that statutes, regulations, judicial decisions and administrative interpretations are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. There can be no assurance, moreover, that the opinion expressed herein will be accepted by the Internal Revenue Service or, if challenged, by a court of law. A change in the authorities or the accuracy or completeness of any of the information, documents, certificates, records, statements, representations or assumptions on which our opinion is based could affect our conclusions. Based upon the foregoing and in reliance thereon, and subject to the qualifications, exceptions, assumptions and limitations contained herein or in the Prospectus, we are of the opinion that, under current United States federal income tax law: 1. Although the matter is not free from doubt, the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities held by the Trust, will be classified for United States federal income tax purposes as indebtedness of the Company. 2. The Trust will be classified for United States federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation. 3. Although the discussion set forth in the Prospectus under the heading "UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS" does not purport to discuss all possible United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Capital Securities, such discussion constitutes, in all material respects, a fair and accurate summary of the United States federal income tax consequences described therein. 2
Except as set forth above, we express no opinion to any party as to any tax consequences, whether federal, state, local or foreign, of the Capital Securities or of any transaction related thereto. This opinion is expressed as of the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to such date or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue. We hereby consent to the use of our name under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus and the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit 8.1 to the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder. Very truly yours, /s/ Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP 3
