Lessee specifically agrees that the flight crew shall have final and complete authority to delay or cancel any flight for any reason or condition which in the sole judgment of the pilot-in-command could compromise the safety of the flight, and to take any other action which in the sole judgment of the pilot-in-command is necessitated by considerations of safety. No such action of the pilot-in-command shall create or support any liability to Lessee or any other person for loss, injury, damage or delay. The Parties further agree that Operator shall not be liable for delay or failure to furnish the Aircraft and crew pursuant to this Agreement for any reason or no reason including, without limitation, circumstances when such failure is caused by government regulation or authority, mechanical difficulty or breakdown, war, civil commotion, strikes or labor disputes, weather conditions, acts of God, or other circumstances within or beyond Operator's reasonable control.
