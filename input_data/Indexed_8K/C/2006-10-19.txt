 - 
YTD #1 rank in global debt underwriting; #2 in global announced M&A; #2 in global equity underwriting.
 - 
Transaction services revenues were a record, up 20%, and net income increased 18%, driven by double-digit growth in customer balances.

Management Comment
        "Our third quarter results were driven by strength in several businesses, including international revenues, up 11%. In our U.S. consumer franchise, we are pleased with the trends we are seeing, and throughout all our businesses, we had good expense discipline. That said, results from our capital markets related businesses fell short of my expectations, and I expect improved results from these businesses going forward," said Charles Prince, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup.
        "During the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic initiatives, investing approximately $320 million to reach and serve our customers in more places, and more effectively. At the same time, we remained highly disciplined on our non-investment expenses." We also repurchased $2 billion of our common shares during the quarter.
        
        "On September 26, Moody's upgraded Citibank's credit rating to Aaa, a direct reflection of the strength and diversity of our franchise, and the way we are running our business. I am very proud of this accomplishment."
th
        "As we move into the fourth quarter, our priorities remain clear: executing on our strategic initiatives to drive organic growth, targeted acquisitions, expense discipline, and generating revenue and earnings growth and superior returns for our owners", said Prince.
Expanding Distribution
        During the third quarter, continued investment spending led to significant consumer branch expansion.
        Citibank international branch openings in the third quarter included 19 in Mexico, 19 in Brazil, 9 in Turkey, and 9 in Russia. CitiFinancial international branch openings included 37 in Mexico, 20 in Brazil, 17 in India and 8 in Poland.

Net income increased 36%, driven by growth in non-interest revenue, lower operating expenses, and a significant decline in credit costs.
        
 - 
Credit costs declined $319 million on lower bankruptcy filings and a continued favorable credit environment, which was partially offset by the impact of new minimum payment requirements. The managed net credit loss ratio declined 140 basis points to 4.26%.
 - 
Revenues increased 2%, driven by a 14% increase in non-interest revenue, which was partially offset by lower net interest revenue due to net interest margin compression. Growth in non-interest revenue primarily reflected increased revenues from previously securitized receivables.
 - 
Average managed loans grew 5%, driven by higher reward and private label card balances, including the addition of Federated card receivables.
 - 
U.S. Retail Distribution

 - 
Expenses increased 6%, primarily due to investment spending. Higher credit costs reflected portfolio growth and the absence of prior-year reserve releases.
 - 
U.S. Commercial Business
 - 
Revenues declined due to the absence of a $162 million revenue benefit recorded in the prior-year period due to settlement of litigation related to the purchase of Copelco.

 -

 - 
Outside of Japan, revenues increased 21%, driven by 22% growth in average loans. Net income declined as revenue growth was offset by increased investment spending, including the opening of 110 new branches, and increased credit costs.
 - 
International Retail Banking
 - 
Revenue growth was driven by a 9% increase in deposits and 18% growth in investment product sales. Average loan balances increased 3%, led by growth in Asia, EMEA and Latin America.
 - 
Expense growth reflected increased business volumes, continued investment spending, and the absence of a $93 million value added tax refund in Mexico recorded in the prior-year period. During the quarter, 66 new branches were opened.
 - 
Credit costs declined significantly due to the absence of a $476 million pre-tax charge to standardize loan write-off policies in EMEA with global write-off policies. Credit costs included loan loss reserve releases in Korea and Mexico. The NCL rate declined to 0.87%.
 - 
Capital Markets and Banking
 - 
Fixed income markets revenues declined 16% to $2.3 billion, primarily driven by lower results in commodities, interest rate products, and foreign exchange.

 - 
Transaction Services
 - 
Record revenues and net income, up 20% and 18%, respectively, were driven by higher customer volumes, reflecting increased liability balances, up 22%; assets under custody, up 14%; and the positive impact of higher short-term interest rates.
 - 
Expenses increased 18%, primarily driven by increased new business activity, investment in growth initiatives, acquisitions, and higher volumes.
 - 
Smith Barney
 - 
Record revenues were driven by strong customer demand for advisory services, resulting in a 32% increase in fee-based revenues, and the acquisition of the Legg Mason retail brokerage business. Transactional revenues declined 7%, reflecting lower customer trading volumes and a continued shift toward offering fee-based advisory products and services.
 - 
Assets under fee-based management increased 25% to $322 billion, driven by both organic growth and the addition of Legg Mason client assets.
 - 
Results included $59 million expense from SFAS 123(R) accruals.
 - 
The Private Bank
 - 
Revenue and net income growth partially reflected the absence of prior-year losses associated with the closing of the Japan Private Bank. Excluding Japan, revenues grew 7%, driven by strong growth in capital markets activity in Asia, which was partially offset by continued net interest margin compression.
 - 
Excluding Japan, net income declined 3%, reflecting higher expenses due to increased professional staffing and investment spending to expand in on-shore markets.
 - 
Alternative Investments
 - 
Revenues and net income declined due to lower results in private equity and liquid investments, which were partially offset by higher client revenues, and an $85 million after-tax gain on the sale of MetLife shares.

Excluding the impact of the Copelco settlement, revenues were approximately even with the prior year as 11% loan growth was offset by net interest margin compression.

In Japan, revenues declined due to lower receivables balances and net interest margins, which was more than offset by lower expenses. Net income declined due to increased credit costs of approximately $160 million (pretax) from ongoing legislative and other actions affecting the consumer finance industry.
Outside of Japan, revenues increased 21%, driven by 22% growth in average loans. Net income declined as revenue growth was offset by increased investment spending, including the opening of 110 new branches, and increased credit costs.

Risk Capital is defined as the amount of capital needed to cover unexpected economic losses during extreme events. Return on Risk Capital is defined as income divided by Risk Capital. Return on Invested Capital is a similar calculation but includes adjustments for goodwill and intangibles in both the numerator and denominator, similar to those necessary to translate return on tangible equity to return on total equity. Return on Risk Capital and Return on Invested Capital are non-GAAP performance measures. Management believes Return on Risk Capital is useful to make incremental investment decisions and serves as a key metric for organic growth initiatives. Return on Invested Capital is used for multi-year investment decisions and as a long term performance measure.
