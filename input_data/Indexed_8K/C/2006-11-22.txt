The Company and the Guarantor will cause each amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus to be filed promptly with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b). If the Prospectus is amended or supplemented (other than by a Pricing Supplement or an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Warrants), the Agent shall be furnished with such information relating to such filing as it may reasonably request, and the Agent shall not be obligated to solicit offers to purchase Warrants so long as it is not reasonably satisfied that such amendment or supplement complies in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. At any time during an Offering Period or during the time a prospectus relating to the Warrants is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, the Company and the Guarantor will promptly advise the Agent of (i) the
 
filing of any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus (other than a Pricing Supplement or an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Warrants), (ii) the filing of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (iii) the receipt by the Company or the Guarantor of comments from the Commission relating to or requests by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or any amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice objecting to its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) the receipt by the Company or the Guarantor of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Warrants for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company and the Guarantor will use their reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the occurrence of any such suspension or objection to the use of the Registration Statement and, upon such issuance, occurrence or notice of objection, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or objection, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using their best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.
          (b) If, at any time prior to the filing of the related Pricing Supplement pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, the Company and the Guarantor will (1) notify promptly the Agent so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (2) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (3) supply any amendment or supplement to the Agent in such quantities as the Agent may reasonably request.

If during such period any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances then existing, not misleading, or if, in the opinion of the Company and the Guarantor, during such period it is necessary to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or file a new registration statement to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company and the Guarantor promptly will notify the Agent to suspend the solicitation of offers to purchase the Warrants and to cease sales of any Warrants. To the extent required under the provision in the last sentence of this subsection (c), the Company and the Guarantor promptly will amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or file a new registration statement (at the expense of the Company and the Guarantor) so as to correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and will use their best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in
 
order to avoid any disruption in use of the Prospectus (and any supplements thereto). If such amendment or supplement, and any documents, certificates, opinions and letters furnished to the Agent pursuant to subsections (m), (n) and (o) of this Section 4(A) in connection with the preparation and filing of such amendment or supplement, are reasonably satisfactory in all respects to the Agent, in its sole discretion, upon the filing of such amendment or supplement with the Commission or effectiveness of an amendment to the Registration Statement, the Agent will resume solicitation of offers to purchase Warrants hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be required to comply with the provisions of subsection (c) of this Section 4(A) during any period from the time the Agent shall have been notified to suspend the solicitation of offers to purchase the Warrants in its capacity as Agent (whether under this subparagraph (c) or otherwise under this Agreement) to the time the Company shall determine that solicitation of offers to purchase the Warrants should be resumed; provided that if the Agent holds any Warrants purchased as principal pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company and the Guarantor shall comply with the provisions of subsection (c) of this Section 4(A) during the period when a prospectus relating to the Warrants is required to be delivered pursuant to the Securities Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172).

          (e) The Company and the Guarantor will use their best efforts to qualify the Warrants for sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions as the Agent reasonably designates, to maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Warrants and, if requested by the Agent, to arrange for the determination of the legality of the Warrants for purchase by institutional investors, except that neither the Company nor the Guarantor shall be required in connection therewith to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
          (f) Upon request, the Company and the Guarantor will furnish to the Agent and counsel for the Agent, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and the Prospectus and, so long as delivery of a prospectus relating to the Warrants by the Agent may be required by the Securities Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of each additional prospectus supplement, Pricing Supplement and Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplements thereto as the Agent may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to each offering that are required to be prepared, furnished or delivered by it.

Indemnification and Contribution
 
the Agent and each person who controls the Agent within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Warrants as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any prospectus supplement, any preliminary or final Pricing Supplement or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company and the Guarantor will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by the Agent specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Guarantor may otherwise have.
provided
however
          (b) The Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Guarantor, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to the Agent, but only with reference to written information relating to the Agent furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by the Agent specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Agent may otherwise have.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party
provided
however
 
shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the Guarantor and the Agent severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "") to which the Company, the Guarantor and the Agent may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and by the Agent on the other from the offering of the Warrants; , , that in no case shall (i) the Agent (except, if there are two or more Agents appointed hereunder, as may be provided in any agreement among Agents relating to the offering of the Warrants) be responsible for any amount in excess of the discount or commission applicable to the Warrants purchased by such Agent hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the Guarantor and the Agent severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and benefits received by the Agent shall be deemed to be equal to the total discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth in the Pricing Supplement. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand or the Agent on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantor and the Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Losses

paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 6, each person who controls the Agent within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of the Agent shall have the same rights to contribution as the Agent, and each person who controls the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

This Agreement may be terminated by either the Company and the Guarantor as to the Agent, or by the Agent, by giving written notice of such termination to the Agent or the Company and the Guarantor, as the case may be. The termination of this Agreement shall not require termination of any agreement by you to purchase Warrants as principal, and the termination of any such agreement shall not require termination of this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated, neither the Company and the Guarantor, on the one hand, nor the Agent, on the other hand, shall have any liability to each other, except as provided in the first sentence of the fourth paragraph of Section 2(a), the last proviso of Section 4(A)(b), and Sections 4(A)(g), 4(A)(h), 6, 8 and 11, and except that, if at the time of termination an offer to purchase any of the Warrants has been accepted by the Company but the time of delivery to the purchaser or its agent of the Warrant or Warrants relating thereto has not occurred, the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor stated in Section 2 and the Company's obligations under the Warrant Procedures and in Sections 2(c), 4(A)(a), 4(A)(b), 4(A)(c), 4(A)(e), 4(A)(i), 4(A)(j), 4(A)(k), 4(A)(1), 4(A)(m), 4(A)(o), 4(A)(q), 4(A)(r) and 5 shall also remain in full force and effect and not be terminated until the delivery of such Warrants.

For the purposes of the foregoing, pledging, placing a lien on or creating a security interest in any shares of Voting Stock of a Significant Subsidiary in order to secure then outstanding Indebtedness of the Guarantor or any Subsidiary shall be deemed to be the incurrence, issuance, assumption or guarantee (as the case may be) of such Indebtedness, but the foregoing shall not apply to Indebtedness secured by a pledge of, lien on or security interest in any shares of Voting Stock of any corporation at the time it becomes a Significant Subsidiary, including extensions, renewals and replacements of such Indebtedness without increase in the amount thereof.

Such assumption shall result in the Warrants of such series becoming the direct obligations of the Guarantor and shall be effected without the consent of the holders of the Warrants of any series. Upon such an assumption, the Guarantor shall execute an amendment to this Agreement evidencing its assumption of all such rights and obligations of the Company, and the Company shall be released from its liabilities hereunder and under such Warrants as obligor on the Warrants of such series.
