The Declaration is qualified as an indenture under the Trust Indenture Act. Pursuant to the Declaration, the number of Citigroup Capital Trustees will initially be five. Three of the Citigroup Capital Trustees (the Regular Trustees) will be persons who are employees or officers of the Company. The fourth Citigroup Capital Trustee will be a financial institution unaffiliated with the Company that will serve as property trustee under the Declaration and as indenture trustee with respect to the Capital Securities for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act (the Institutional Trustee). The fifth Citigroup Capital Trustee will be a financial institution or an affiliate thereof which maintains a principal place of business in the State of Delaware, meeting the requirements of the Delaware Act (the Delaware Trustee). Initially, The Bank of New York, a New York banking association (BoNY), will act as the Institutional Trustee and The Bank of New York (Delaware), a banking association with its principal place of business in the State of Delaware, will act as the Delaware Trustee until removed or replaced by the holder of the Common Securities. The Capital Securities will be guaranteed by the Company on a subordinated basis with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption or otherwise (the Guarantee) pursuant to the Capital Securities Guarantee Agreement dated as of November 22, 2006 (the Guarantee Agreement) between the Company and BoNY, as Trustee (the Guarantee Trustee).
The assets of the Trust will consist of 6.45% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due December 31, 2066 (the Subordinated Debentures) of the Company which will be issued under an indenture, dated as of September 15, 2006 (as supplemented, the Indenture), between the Company and BoNY, as Trustee (successor-in-interest to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.)

Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Exchange Act on or before the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms amend, amendment or supplement with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.

in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
(c)
 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying partys choice at the indemnifying partys expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below);
provided, however
, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying partys election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
 
12
 
(d)
 
In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the Trust and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively 
Losses
) to which the Company, the Trust and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Trust on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Capital Securities;
provided, however
, that in no case shall (i) any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Capital Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Capital Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the Trust and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Trust on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and the Trust shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Trust, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company and the Trust on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Trust and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company, as applicable, within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company and the Regular Trustees who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Trust, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

(v)
  
the Institutional Trustee's sole duty with respect to the custody, safe keeping and physical preservation of the Debentures and the Institutional Trustee Account shall be to deal with such property in a similar manner as the Institutional Trustee deals with similar property for its own account, subject to the protections and limitations on liability afforded to the Institutional Trustee under this Declaration and the Trust Indenture Act;

the Indemnified Person shall resolve such conflict of interest, take such action or provide such terms, considering in each case the relative interest of each party (including its own interest) to such conflict, agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interests, any customary or accepted industry practices, and any applicable generally accepted accounting practices or principles. In the absence of bad faith by the Indemnified Person, the resolution, action or term so made, taken or provided by the Indemnified Person shall not constitute a breach of this Declaration or any other agreement contemplated herein or of any duty or obligation of the Indemnified Person at law or in equity or otherwise.

SECTION 10.4
  
Indemnification
.
 
(a)
  
(i)
The Debenture Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Trust) by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere
or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Company Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
 
(ii)
  
The Debenture Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Trust to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust and except that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Company Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
 
(iii)
  
To the extent that a Company Indemnified Person shall be successful on the merits or otherwise (including dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action without admission of liability) in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified, to the full extent permitted by law, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
 
 
35
 
(iv)
  
Any indemnification under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Debenture Issuer only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Company Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii). Such determination shall be made (1) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of such Regular Trustees who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the Common Security Holder of the Trust.
 
(v)
  
Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Company Indemnified Person in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) shall be paid by the Debenture Issuer in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Company Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Debenture Issuer as authorized in this Section 10.4(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Debenture Issuer if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees, (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iii) the Common Security Holder of the Trust, that, based upon the facts known to the Regular Trustees, counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time such determination is made, such Company Indemnified Person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Company Indemnified Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Regular Trustees, independent legal counsel or Common Security Holder reasonably determine that such person deliberately breached his duty to the Trust or its Common or Capital Security Holders.
 
(vi)
  
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 10.4(a) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors of the Debenture Issuer or Capital Security Holders of the Trust or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. All rights to indemnification under this Section 10.4(a) shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the Debenture Issuer and each Company Indemnified Person who serves in such capacity at any time while this Section 10.4(a) is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Section 10.4(a) shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.
 
(vii)
  
The Debenture Issuer may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Company Indemnified Person against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Debenture Issuer would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a).
 
 
36
 
(viii)
  
For purposes of this Section 10.4(a), references to "the Trust" shall include, in addition to the resulting or surviving entity, any constituent entity (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger, so that any person who is or was a director, trustee, officer or employee of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another entity, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a) with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as he would have with respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued.
 
(ix)
  
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 10.4(a) shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Company Indemnified Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
 
(b)
  
The Debenture Issuer agrees to indemnify the (i) Institutional Trustee, (ii) the Delaware Trustee, (iii) any Affiliate of the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, and (iv) any officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, employees, representatives, custodians, nominees or agents of the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee (each of the Persons in (i) through (iv) being referred to as a "Fiduciary Indemnified Person") for, and to hold each Fiduciary Indemnified Person harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration or the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of defending itself against or investigating any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The obligation to indemnify as set forth in this Section 10.4(b) shall survive the resignation or removal of the Institutional Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, and the satisfaction and discharge of this Declaration.
 
SECTION 10.5
  
Outside Businesses
.
 
Any Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee and the Institutional Trustee may engage in or possess an interest in other business ventures of any nature or description, independently or with others, similar or dissimilar to the business of the Trust, and the Trust and the Holders of Securities shall have no rights by virtue of this Declaration in and to such independent ventures or the income or profits derived therefrom, and the pursuit of any such venture, even if competitive with the business of the Trust, shall not be deemed wrongful or improper. No Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee, or the Institutional Trustee shall be obligated to present any particular investment or other opportunity to the Trust even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Trust, could be taken by the Trust, and any Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee and the Institutional Trustee shall have the right to take for its own account (individually or as a partner or fiduciary) or to recommend to others any such particular investment or other opportunity. Any Covered Person, the Delaware Trustee and the Institutional Trustee may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor, or may act as depositary for, trustee or agent for, or act on any committee or body of holders of, securities or other obligations of the Sponsor or its Affiliates.

The Regular Trustees shall file required forms with applicable jurisdictions and, unless an exemption from withholding is properly established by a Holder, shall remit amounts withheld with respect to the Holder to applicable jurisdictions. To the extent that the Trust is required to withhold and pay over any amounts to any authority with respect to distributions or allocations to any Holder, the amount withheld shall be deemed to be a distribution in the amount of the withholding to the Holder. In the event of any claimed overwithholding, Holders shall be limited to an action against the applicable jurisdiction. If the amount required to be withheld was not withheld from actual Distributions made, the Trust may reduce subsequent Distributions by the amount of such withholding.

SECTION 12.2    
Meetings of the Holders of Securities; Action by Written Consent
.
 
(a)
  
Meetings of the Holders of any class of Securities may be called at any time by the Regular Trustees (or as provided in the terms of the Securities) to consider and act on any matter on which Holders of such class of Securities are entitled to act under the terms of this Declaration, the terms of the Securities or the rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are listed or admitted for trading. The Regular Trustees shall call a meeting of the Holders of such class if directed to do so by the Holders of Securities representing at least 10% in liquidation amount of such class of Securities. Such direction shall be given by delivering to the Regular Trustees one or more calls in a writing stating that the signing Holders of Securities wish to call a meeting and indicating the general or specific purpose for which the meeting is to be called. Any Holders of Securities calling a meeting shall specify in writing the Security Certificates held by the Holders of Securities exercising the right to call a meeting and only those Securities specified shall be counted for purposes of determining whether the required percentage set forth in the second sentence of this paragraph has been met.
 
(b)
  
Except to the extent otherwise provided in the terms of the Securities, the following provisions shall apply to meetings of Holders of Securities:
 
(i)
  
notice of any such meeting shall be given to all the Holders of Securities having a right to vote thereat at least 7 days and not more than 60 days before the date of such meeting. Whenever a vote, consent or approval of the Holders of Securities is permitted or required under this Declaration or the rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are listed or admitted for trading, such vote, consent or approval may be given at a meeting of the Holders of Securities. Any action that may be taken at a meeting of the Holders of Securities may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing setting forth the action so taken is signed by the Holders of Securities owning not less than the minimum amount of Securities in liquidation amount that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all Holders of Securities having a right to vote thereon were present and voting. Prompt notice of the taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Holders of Securities entitled to vote who have not consented in writing. The Regular Trustees may specify that any written ballot submitted to the Security Holder for the purpose of taking any action without a meeting shall be returned to the Trust within the time specified by the Regular Trustees;
 
(ii)
  
each Holder of a Security may authorize any Person to act for it by proxy on all matters in which a Holder of Securities is entitled to participate, including waiving notice of any meeting, or voting or participating at a meeting. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the Holder of Securities executing it. Except as otherwise provided herein, all matters relating to the giving, voting or validity of proxies shall be governed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware relating to proxies, and judicial interpretations thereunder, as if the Trust were a Delaware corporation and the Holders of the Securities were stockholders of a Delaware corporation;
 
 
41
 
(iii)
  
each meeting of the Holders of the Securities shall be conducted by the Regular Trustees or by such other Person that the Regular Trustees may designate; and
 
(iv)
  
unless the Statutory Trust Act, this Declaration, the terms of the Securities, the Trust Indenture Act or the listing rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are then listed or trading, otherwise provides, the Regular Trustees, in their sole discretion, shall establish all other provisions relating to meetings of Holders of Securities, including notice of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be voted on by any Holders of Securities, waiver of any such notice, action by consent without a meeting, the establishment of a record date, quorum requirements, voting in person or by proxy or any other matter with respect to the exercise of any such right to vote.

Pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, dated as of November 22, 2006 (as amended from time to time, the "Declaration"), the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions, preferences and other terms and provisions of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities are set out below (each capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning set forth in the Declaration or, if not defined in such Declaration, as defined in the Prospectus referred to below):
 
1.
  
Designation and Number
.
 
(a)
  
Capital Securities
. 64,000,000 Capital Securities of the Trust with an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of ONE BILLION SIX HUNDRED MILLION dollars ($1,600,000,000), and a liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of $25 per capital security, are hereby designated for the purposes of identification only as "6.45% Capital Securities" (the "Capital Securities"). The Capital Security Certificates evidencing the Capital Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice or to conform to the rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are listed.
 
(b)
  
Common Securities
. 20,000 Common Securities of the Trust with an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND dollars ($500,000), and a liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of $25 per common security, are hereby designated for the purposes of identification only as "6.45% Common Securities" (the "Common Securities"). The Common Security Certificates evidencing the Common Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice.
 
2.
  
Distributions
.
 
(a)
  
Distributions payable on each Security will be fixed at a rate per annum of 6.45% (the "Coupon Rate") of the stated liquidation amount of $25 per Security, such rate being the rate of interest payable on the Debentures to be held by the Institutional Trustee. Distributions in arrears beyond the first date such Distributions are payable (or would be payable, if not for any Extension Period (as defined below) or default by the Debenture Issuer on the Debentures) will bear interest thereon compounded quarterly at the Coupon Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law). The term "Distributions" as used herein includes such cash distributions and any such interest payable unless otherwise stated. A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee and to the extent the Institutional Trustee has funds available therefor. The amount of Distributions payable for any period will be computed for any full quarterly Distribution period on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and for any period shorter than a full quarterly Distribution period for which Distributions are computed, Distributions will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed per 90-day quarter.
 
 
I-1
 
(b)
  
Distributions on the Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from and including November 22, 2006, and will be payable quarterly in arrears, on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, commencing on December 31, 2006. When, as and if available for payment, Distributions will be made by the Institutional Trustee, except as otherwise described below. The Debenture Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Debentures by extending the interest payment period from time to time on the Debentures for a period not exceeding 40 consecutive quarters (each an "Extension Period"), during which Extension Period no interest shall be due and payable on the Debentures, provided, that no Extension Period may extend beyond the date of maturity of the Debentures. As a consequence of the Debenture Issuer's extension of the interest payment period, quarterly Distributions will also be deferred. Despite such deferral, quarterly Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the Coupon Rate compounded quarterly during any such Extension Period. In the event that the Debenture Issuer exercises its right to extend the interest payment period, then (a) the Debenture Issuer shall not declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto (other than
(i) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, (ii) repurchases of shares of common stock of Citigroup pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the extension period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan (iii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Company's capital stock for any other class or series of the Company's capital stock, (iv) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged), or (v) the purchase of Citigroup's capital stock in connection with the distribution thereof; and (b) except for any partial payments of deferred interest in accordance with the Alternative Payment Mechanism (as defined below), the Debenture Issuer shall not make any payment of interest on or principal of (or premium, if any, on), or repay, repurchase or redeem, any debt securities or guarantees issued by the Debenture Issuer that rank pari passu with or junior to the Debentures. The foregoing, however, will not apply to any stock dividends paid by Citigroup where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid. In addition, the Debenture Issuer may pay current interest at any time with cash from any source. Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Debenture Issuer may further extend such Extension Period; provided, that such Extension Period, together with all such previous and further extensions thereof, may not exceed 40 consecutive quarters; provided further, that no Extension Period may extend beyond the maturity of the Debentures. Payments of deferred Distributions and accrued interest thereon will be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the first record date before the end of the Extension Period. Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Debenture Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements. The Regular Trustees will give notice to each Holder of any Extension Period upon their receipt of notice thereof from the Debenture Issuer.
 
 
I-2
 
(c)
  
If the Debenture Issuer does not pay all accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures for a period of 20 consecutive quarterly periods or if the Debenture Issuer pays current interest on the Debentures during an Extension Period, it will be subject to the "Alternative Payment Mechanism," whereby the Debenture Issuer will be obliged to continuously use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell shares of its common stock (including treasury shares). The Debenture Issuer will notify the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or its successor as the Debenture Issuers primary federal banking regulator (collectively, the Federal Reserve) (1) of the commencement of any Extension Period, (2) of the fifth anniversary of the commencement of an Extension period or earlier payment of current interest on the Debentures during an Extension Period and (3) of its intention to sell shares of its common stock and/or Qualified Warrants (as defined below) and to apply the net proceeds from such sale to pay deferred interest on the Debentures at least 25 Business Days in advance of the relevant payment date (or such longer period as may be required by the Federal Reserve or by other supervisory action). The Debenture Issuer may pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures on or prior to the next interest payment date using only the net proceeds (after underwriters or placement agents fees, commissions or discounts and other expenses relating to the issuances) of such sales received by the Debenture Issuer during the 180-day period prior to that interest payment date, except that the Debenture Issuer may pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures with cash from any source (i) upon the maturity of the Debentures, (ii) during the occurrence and continuation of a Supervisory Event (as defined in the Indenture) or (iii) if an Event of Default and Acceleration under the Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing. Corresponding Distributions will be made on the Securities. If (1) a Supervisory Event or (2) a Market Disruption Event (as defined in the Indenture) shall have occurred and be continuing; then the Debenture Issuer will be excused from its obligation to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell its common stock and apply the net proceeds of such sale to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures. During the occurrence of a Supervisory Event, the Debenture Issuer will, no later than 30 Business Days prior to each interest payment date, notify the Federal Reserve of its intention to both (1) issue or sell shares of common stock and (2) to apply the net proceeds from such sale to pay deferred interest on the Debentures, and shall only take any such actions if the Federal Reserve does not disapprove of any such actions within ten (10) Business Days after the Debenture Issuer gives such notice to the Federal Reserve. The obligation of the Debenture Issuer to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell its common stock and apply the net proceeds of such sale to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures shall resume at such time as no Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event exists or is continuing. The Debenture Issuer is not permitted to sell shares of common stock in excess of a number of shares of common stock which at November 22, 2006 is equal to 55,000,000 (the "Share Cap Amount"), for the purpose of satisfying the Alternative Payment Mechanism or otherwise paying deferred interest on the Debentures then outstanding. If the issued and outstanding shares of common stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, then the Share Cap Amount shall be correspondingly adjusted. The Debenture Issuer shall increase the Share Cap Amount (including through the increase of its authorized share capital, if necessary) to an amount that would allow the Debenture Issuer to raise sufficient proceeds to satisfy its obligations to pay deferred interest in full at the end of the first year of an Extension Period (and on each
 
 
I-3
 
 
subsequent anniversary of the end of the first year of an Extension Period to the extent that an Extension Period would last more than one year), if the then-current Share Cap Amount would not allow the Debenture Issuer to raise sufficient proceeds to satisfy its obligations to pay deferred interest (including compounded interest to that date) assuming a price per share equal to the average trading price of the Debenture Issuer's common shares over the ten-trading-day period preceding such date; provided that the Debenture Issuer will not be obligated to increase the Share Cap Amount above 325,000,000 shares. Until the tenth anniversary of the commencement of an Extension Period, a Default will occur if the Debenture Issuer does not increase the Share Cap Amount to an amount that is greater than 55,000,000 shares when required to do so as described above; provided that no Default will occur if the Debenture Issuer has increased the share cap amount to 325,000,000 shares. The Debenture Issuer will not be obligated to issue common stock prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of an Extension Period if the gross proceeds of any issuance of common stock and Qualified Warrants applied to pay deferred interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism, together with the gross proceeds of all prior issuances of common stock and Qualified Warrants applied since the commencement of the Extension Period, would exceed an amount equal to 2% of the product of (1) the average of the Current Stock Market Prices (as defined in the Indenture) of the Debenture Issuer's common stock on the 10 consecutive trading days ending on the fourth trading day immediately preceding the date of issuance by the Debenture Issuer of common stock applied to pay deferred interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism and (2) the total number of issued and outstanding shares of the Debenture Issuer's common stock as of the date of the Debenture Issuer's publicly available consolidated financial statements (the APM Maximum Obligation). Once the Debenture Issuer reaches the APM Maximum Obligation for an Extension Period, the Debenture Issuer will not be obligated to issue more common stock or Qualified Warrants in satisfaction of the Alternative Payment Mechanism prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of an Extension Period even if the Current Stock Market Price of the Debenture Issuer's common stock or the number of outstanding shares of its common stock subsequently increase. The APM Maximum Obligation will cease to apply following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of an Extension Period, at which point the Debenture Issuer must repay any deferred interest, regardless of the time at which it was deferred, using proceeds from sales of the Debenture Issuer's common stock, including treasury shares, subject to any Market Disruption Event, Supervisory Event, and the Share Cap Amount. If the APM Maximum Obligation has been reached during an Extension Period and the Debenture Issuer subsequently repays all deferred interest, the APM Maximum Obligation will cease to apply at the termination of such Extension Period and will not apply again unless and until the Debenture Issuer starts a new Extension Period. "Qualified Warrants" means warrants for the Debenture Issuer's common stock that (1) have an exercise price greater than the Current Stock Market Price of the Debenture Issuer's common stock, and (2) the Debenture Issuer is not entitled to redeem for cash and the holders are not entitled to require the Debenture Issuer to repurchase for cash in any circumstances.
 
(d)
  
Distributions on the Securities will be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the books and records of the Trust at the close of business on the relevant record dates. While the Capital Securities remain in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant payment dates which payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Debentures. Subject to any applicable laws and regulations and the provisions of the Declaration, each such payment in respect of the Capital
 
 
I-4
 
 
Securities will be made as described under the heading "Description of the Capital Securities -- Book-Entry Only Issuance" in the Prospectus dated November 15, 2006 (the "Prospectus"), of the Trust included in the Registration Statement on Form S-3 of the Sponsor, the Trust and certain other statutory trusts. The relevant record dates for the Common Securities shall be the same record date as for the Capital Securities. If the Capital Securities shall not continue to remain in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates for the Capital Securities shall conform to the rules of any securities exchange on which the securities are listed and, if none, shall be selected by the Regular Trustees, which dates shall be more than 14 days but less than 60 days prior to the relevant payment dates, which payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Debentures. Distributions payable on any Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution payment date, as a result of the Debenture Issuer having failed to make a payment under the Debentures, will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date determined in accordance with the Indenture. If any date on which Distributions are payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.
 
(e)
  
In the event that there is any money or other property held by or for the Trust that is not accounted for hereunder, such property shall be distributed Pro Rata (as defined herein) among the Holders of the Securities.
 
3.
  
Liquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution
.
 
(a)
  
In the event of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding-up or termination of the Trust, the Holders of the Securities on the date of the dissolution, winding-up or termination, as the case may be, will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Holders of Securities after satisfaction of liabilities of creditors, distributions in an amount equal to the aggregate of the stated liquidation amount of $25 per Security plus accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"), unless, in connection with such dissolution, winding-up or termination, Debentures in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of, with an interest rate equal to the Coupon Rate, and bearing accrued and unpaid interest in an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Distributions on, such Securities outstanding at such time, have been distributed on a Pro Rata basis to the Holders of the Securities in exchange for such Securities. Prior to any such Liquidation Distribution, the Debenture Issuer will obtain any required regulatory approval.
 
(b)
  
If, upon any such dissolution, the Liquidation Distribution can be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then the amounts payable directly by the Trust on the Securities shall be paid on a Pro Rata basis.
 
 
I-5
 
4.
  
Redemption and Distribution
.
 
(a)
  
Upon the repayment of the Debentures in whole or in part, whether at maturity or upon redemption (either at the option of the Debenture Issuer or pursuant to a Special Event as described below), the proceeds from such repayment or payment shall be simultaneously applied to redeem Securities having an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures so repaid or redeemed at a redemption price of $25 per Security plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon at the date of the redemption, payable in cash (the "Redemption Price"). Holders shall be given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice of such redemption. Prior to any such redemption, the Debenture Issuer will obtain any required regulatory approval.
 
(b)
  
If fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be so redeemed, the Securities will be redeemed Pro Rata and the Capital Securities to be redeemed will be as described in Section 4(f)(ii) below.
 
(c)
  
Subject to obtaining any required regulatory approval, if, at any time, a Tax Event, an Investment Company Event or a Regulatory Capital Event (each as defined below, and each a "Special Event") shall occur and be continuing, Citigroup shall have the right, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, to redeem the Debentures, in whole or in part, for cash within 90 days following the occurrence of such Special Event, and, following such redemption, Securities with an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures so redeemed shall be redeemed by the Trust at the Redemption Price on a Pro Rata basis; provided, however, that if at the time there is available to Citigroup or the Trust the opportunity to eliminate, within such 90-day period, the Special Event by taking some ministerial action, such as filing a form or making an election or pursuing some other similar reasonable measure that will have no adverse effect on the Trust, Citigroup or the holders of the Securities, then Citigroup or the Trust will pursue such measure in lieu of redemption.
 
"Tax Event" means that the Regular Trustees shall have received an opinion of a nationally recognized independent tax counsel experienced in such matters (a "Tax Event Opinion") to the effect that, as a result of (a) any amendment to, or change (including any announced prospective change) in, the laws (or any regulations thereunder) of the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein or (b) any amendment to, or change in, an interpretation or application of such laws or regulations by any legislative body, court, governmental agency or regulatory authority (including the enactment of any legislation and the publication of any judicial decision or regulatory determination on or after the date of the Prospectus), in either case after the date of the Prospectus, there is more than an insubstantial risk that (i) the Trust would be subject to United States federal income tax with respect to interest accrued or received on the Debentures, (ii) the Trust would be subject to more than a de minimis amount of other taxes, duties or other governmental charges, or (iii) interest payable to the Trust on the Debentures would not be deductible, in whole or in part, by the Debenture Issuer for United States federal income tax purposes.
 
"Investment Company Event" means that the Regular Trustees shall have received an opinion of a nationally recognized independent counsel experienced in practice under the Investment Company Act (an "Investment Company Event Opinion") to the effect that, as a result of the occurrence of a change in law or regulation or a written change in interpretation or application of law or regulation by any legislative body, court, governmental agency or regulatory authority (a "Change in 1940 Act Law"), there is a more than an insubstantial risk that the Trust is or will be considered an Investment Company which is required to be registered under the Investment Company Act, which Change in 1940 Act Law becomes effective on or after the date of the Prospectus.
 
 
I-6
 
"Regulatory Capital Event" means a determination by Citigroup, based on an opinion of counsel experienced in such matters (who may be an employee of Citigroup or any of its affiliates), that, as a result of (a) any amendment to, clarification of or change (including any announced prospective change) in applicable laws or regulations or official interpretations thereof or policies with respect thereto or (b) any official administrative pronouncement or judicial decision interpreting or applying such laws or regulations, which amendment, clarification, change, pronouncement or decision is announced or is effective after the date of the Prospectus, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Capital Securities will no longer constitute Tier I Capital of Citigroup or any bank holding company of which Citigroup is a subsidiary (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines or policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or its successor as Citigroup's primary federal banking regulator, provided, however that the distribution of the Debentures in connection with the liquidation of the Trust shall not in and of itself constitute a Regulatory Capital Event unless such liquidation shall have occurred in connection with a Tax Event or an Investment Company Event.
 
On and from the date fixed by the Regular Trustees for any distribution of the Debentures and dissolution of the Trust: (i) the Securities will no longer be deemed to be outstanding, (ii) DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), as the record Holder of the Capital Securities, will receive a registered global certificate or certificates representing the Debentures to be delivered upon such distribution and (iii) any certificates representing Securities, except for certificates representing Capital Securities held by DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), will be deemed to represent beneficial interests in the Debentures having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of, with an interest rate identical to the Coupon Rate of, and accrued and unpaid interest equal to accrued and unpaid Distributions on such Securities until such certificates are presented to the Debenture Issuer or its agent for transfer or reissue.
 
(d)
  
The Trust may not redeem fewer than all the outstanding Securities unless all accrued and unpaid Distributions have been paid on all Securities for all quarterly Distribution periods terminating on or before the date of redemption.
 
(e)
  
If the Debentures are distributed to the Holders of the Securities, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Debenture Issuer will use its best efforts to cause the Debentures to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or on such other exchange as the Capital Securities were listed immediately prior to the distribution of the Debentures.
 
(f)
  
Redemption or Distribution procedures will be as follows:
 
 
I-7
 
(i)
  
Notice of any redemption of, or notice of distribution of Debentures in exchange for the Securities (a "Redemption/Distribution Notice") will be given by the Trust by mail to the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee and to each Holder of the Securities to be redeemed or exchanged not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption or exchange thereof which, in the case of a redemption, will be the date fixed for redemption of the Debentures. For purposes of the calculation of the date of redemption or exchange and the dates on which notices are given pursuant to this Section 4(f)(i), a Redemption/ Distribution Notice shall be deemed to be given on the day such notice is first mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of the Securities. Each Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be addressed to the Holders of the Securities at the address of each such Holder appearing in the books and records of the Trust. No defect in the Redemption/Distribution Notice or in the mailing of either thereof with respect to any Holder shall affect the validity of the redemption or exchange proceedings with respect to any other Holder.
 
(ii)
  
In the event that fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be redeemed Pro Rata from each Holder of Capital Securities, it being understood that, in respect of Capital Securities registered in the name of and held of record by DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee), the distribution of the proceeds of such redemption will be made to each Clearing Agency Participant (or Person on whose behalf such nominee holds such securities) in accordance with the procedures applied by such agency or nominee.
 
(iii)
  
If Securities are to be redeemed and the Trust gives a Redemption/Distribution Notice, which notice may only be issued if the Debentures are redeemed as set out in this Section 4 (which notice will be irrevocable), then (A) while the Capital Securities are in book-entry only form, with respect to the Capital Securities, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the redemption date, provided, that the Debenture Issuer has paid to the Institutional Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption or maturity of the Debentures, the Institutional Trustee will deposit irrevocably with DTC or its nominee (or successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to the Capital Securities and will give DTC (or any successor Clearing Agency) irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities, and (B) with respect to Capital Securities issued in definitive form and Common Securities, provided, that the Debenture Issuer has paid the Institutional Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption or maturity of the Debentures, the Institutional Trustee will pay the relevant Redemption Price to the Holders of such Securities by check mailed to the address of the relevant Holder appearing on the books and records of the Trust on the redemption date. If a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall have been given and funds deposited as required, if applicable, then immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such deposit, or on the redemption date, as applicable, distributions will cease to accrue on the Securities so called for redemption and all rights of the Holders of such Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of the Holders of such Securities to receive the Redemption Price, but without interest on such Redemption Price. Neither the Regular Trustees nor the Trust shall be required to register or cause to be registered the transfer of any Securities that have been so called for redemption. If any date fixed for redemption of Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Securities is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Institutional Trustee or by the Sponsor as guarantor pursuant to the relevant Securities Guarantee, Distributions on such Securities will continue to accrue from the original redemption date to the actual date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.
 
 
I-8
 
(iv)
  
Redemption/Distribution Notices shall be sent by the Regular Trustees on behalf of the Trust to (A) in respect of the Capital Securities, DTC or its nominee (or any successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) if the Global Certificates have been issued or, if Definitive Capital Security Certificates have been issued, to the Holder thereof and (B) in respect of the Common Securities to the Holder thereof.
 
(v)
  
Subject to the foregoing and applicable law (including, without limitation, United States federal securities laws), the Debenture Issuer or its affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase outstanding Capital Securities by tender, in the open market or by private agreement.

Voting Rights - Capital Securities
.
 
(a)
  
Except as provided under Sections 5(b) and 7 and as otherwise required by law and the Declaration, the Holders of the Capital Securities will have no voting rights.
 
(b)
  
Subject to the requirements set forth in this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Securities, voting separately as a class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional Trustee, or direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Institutional Trustee under the Declaration, including the right to direct the Institutional Trustee, as holder of the Debentures, to (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee, or exercise any trust or power conferred on the Debenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures, (ii) waive any past Default (as defined in the Indenture) that is waivable under Section 5.6 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due and payable or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Debentures where such consent shall be required; provided, however, that, where a consent or action under the Indenture would require the consent or act of each holder of each Debenture affected thereby, such consent or action under the Indenture shall not be effective until each Holder of Capital Securities shall have consented to such action or provided such consent. The Institutional Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities. Except with respect to directing the time, method and place of conducting a proceeding for a remedy available to the Institutional Trustee, the
 
 
I-9
 
Institutional Trustee, as holder of the Debentures, shall not take any of the actions described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above unless the Institutional Trustee has obtained an opinion of a nationally recognized independent tax counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that as a result of such action, the Trust will not fail to be classified as a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes. If the Institutional Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Debentures, any Holder of Capital Securities may directly institute a legal proceeding against the Debenture Issuer to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Debentures without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Institutional Trustee or any other Person or entity. If a Default under the Declaration has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Debenture Issuer to pay interest or principal on the Debentures on the date such interest or principal is otherwise payable (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), then a holder of Capital Securities may also directly institute a proceeding for enforcement of payment to such holder (a "Direct Action") of the principal of or interest on the Debentures having a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Securities of such holder on or after the respective due date specified in the Debentures without first (i) directing the Institutional Trustee to enforce the terms of the Debentures or (ii) instituting a legal proceeding directly against the Debenture Issuer to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Debentures. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Holders of Capital Securities will not be able to exercise directly any other remedy available to the holders of the Debentures. In connection with such Direct Action, Citigroup will be subrogated to the rights of such Holder of Capital Securities under the Declaration to the extent of any payment made by Citigroup to such holder of Capital Securities in such Direct Action.
 
Any required approval or direction of Holders of Capital Securities may be given at a separate meeting of Holders of Capital Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of Securities in the Trust or pursuant to written consent. The Regular Trustees will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of Capital Securities are entitled to vote, or of any matter upon which action by written consent of such Holders is to be taken, to be mailed to each Holder of record of Capital Securities. Each such notice will include a statement setting forth (i) the date of such meeting or the date by which such action is to be taken, (ii) a description of any resolution proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote or of such matter upon which written consent is sought and (iii) instructions for the delivery of proxies or consents.
 
No vote or consent of the Holders of the Capital Securities will be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel Capital Securities or to distribute the Debentures in accordance with this Declaration and the terms of the Securities.
 
Notwithstanding that Holders of Capital Securities are entitled to vote or consent under any of the circumstances described above, any of the Capital Securities that are owned by the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor shall not be entitled to vote or consent and shall, for purposes of such vote or consent, be treated as if they were not outstanding.

Except as provided under Sections 6(b), (c) and 7 as otherwise required by law and the Declaration, the Holders of the Common Securities will have no voting rights.

The Holders of the Common Securities are entitled, in accordance with and subject to Article V of the Declaration, to vote to appoint, remove or replace any Trustee or to increase or decrease the number of Trustees.
 
(c)
  
Subject to Section 2.6 of the Declaration and only after the Default with respect to the Capital Securities has been cured, waived, or otherwise eliminated and subject to the requirements of the second to last sentence of this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Common Securities, voting separately as a class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional Trustee, or direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Institutional Trustee under the Declaration, including (i) directing the time, method, place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Debenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures, (ii) waiving any past Default (as defined in the Indenture) that is waivable under Section 5.6 of the Indenture, or (iii) exercising any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due and payable, provided that, where a consent or action under the Indenture would require the consent or act of the Holders of greater than a majority in principal amount of Debentures affected thereby (a "Super Majority"), the Institutional Trustee may only give such consent or take such action at the written direction of the Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the Common Securities which the relevant Super Majority represents of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures outstanding. Pursuant to this Section 6(c), the Institutional Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities. Other than with respect to directing the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional Trustee or the Debenture Trustee as set forth above, the Institutional Trustee shall not take any action in accordance with the directions of the Holders of the Common Securities under this paragraph unless the Institutional Trustee has obtained an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that for the purposes of United States federal income tax the Trust will not be classified as other than a grantor trust on account of such action. If the Institutional Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Declaration, any Holder of Common Securities may institute a legal proceeding directly against any Person to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Declaration, without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Institutional Trustee or any other Person.
 
Any approval or direction of Holders of Common Securities may be given at a separate meeting of Holders of Common Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of Securities in the Trust or pursuant to written consent. The Regular Trustees will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of Common Securities are entitled to vote, or of any matter upon which action by written consent of such Holders is to be taken, to be mailed to each Holder of record of Common Securities. Each such notice will include a statement setting forth (i) the date of such meeting or the date by which such action is to be taken, (ii) a description of any resolution proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote or of such matter upon which written consent is sought and (iii) instructions for the delivery of proxies or consents.
 
No vote or consent of the Holders of the Common Securities will be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel Common Securities or to distribute the Debentures in accordance with the Declaration and the terms of the Securities.

E.
  
The Corporation acknowledges that reliance by each Covered Debtholder upon the covenants in this Covenant is reasonable and foreseeable by the Corporation and that, were the Corporation to disregard its covenants in this Covenant, each Covered Debtholder would have sustained an injury as a result of its reliance on such covenants.

The modifications in this Article One shall have no effect upon any series of Securities Outstanding on the date hereof but shall be applicable only to Securities issued after the date hereof.
Section 1.01
 
Section 13.5 shall be amended by deleting paragraph (c) in its entirety and substituting therefor the following:
 
"
(c)
 
The Company is not permitted to sell shares of common stock in excess of a number of shares of common stock to be specified pursuant to a Board Resolution, and set forth in an Officers Certificate for each series of Securities (in each case, the "Share Cap Amount"), for the purpose of satisfying Section 13.5(a) or otherwise paying Deferred Interest on the Securities of the relevant series then outstanding. If the issued and outstanding shares of common stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, then each affected Share Cap Amount shall be correspondingly adjusted. The Company shall increase a Share Cap Amount (including through the increase of its authorized share capital, if necessary) to an amount that would allow the Company to raise sufficient proceeds to satisfy its obligations to pay Deferred Interest in full at the end of the first year of an Extended Interest Payment Period (and on each subsequent anniversary of the end of the first year of an Extended Interest Payment Period to the extent that an Extended Interest Payment Period would last more than one year), if a then-current Share Cap Amount would not allow the Company to raise sufficient proceeds to satisfy its obligations to pay Deferred Interest (including Compounded Interest to that date) assuming a price per share equal to the average trading price of the Companys common shares over the ten-trading-day period preceding such date;
provided
that the Company will not be obligated to increase a Share Cap Amount above the maximum number of shares specified in the relevant Officers Certificate. Until the Tenth Deferral Anniversary, a Default will occur if the Company does not increase the relevant Share Cap Amount to an amount that is greater than the minimum number of shares specified in the relevant Officers Certificate when required to do so as described above; provided that no Default will occur if the Company has increased the relevant Share Cap Amount to the maximum number of shares specified in the relevant Officers Certificate."

Section 2.02
 
Except as hereby expressly modified, the Indenture is in all respects ratified and confirmed and all the terms, conditions and provisions thereof shall remain in full force and effect. This First Supplemental Indenture shall take effect on the date hereof.
 
Section 2.03

Re:
 
Registration Statement on Form S-3
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel to Citigroup Capital XVI, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"), and Citigroup Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the public offering by the Trust of 64,000,000 of its 6.45% enhanced trust preferred securities (liquidation amount $25 per capital security) (the "Capital Securities") and related issuance by the Company of $1,600,500,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.45% junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due December 31, 2066 (the "Junior Subordinated Debt Securities ").
 
This opinion is being furnished to you in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(8) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
In connection with our opinion, we have examined and relied on originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the Registration Statement, the final prospectus dated November 15, 2006 (the "Prospectus") and such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein. We have also relied upon statements and representations made to us by representatives of the Company and the Trust and have assumed that such statements and the facts set forth in such representations are true, correct and complete without regard to any qualification as to knowledge or belief. For purposes of this opinion, we have assumed the validity and the initial and continuing accuracy of the documents, certificates, records, statements and representations referred to above. We have also assumed that the transactions related to the offering of the Capital Securities will be consummated in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus.

In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic, electronic or facsimile copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. In making our examination of documents executed, or to be executed, by the parties indicated therein, we have assumed that each party has, or will have, the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder, and we have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by each party indicated in the documents and that such documents constitute, or will constitute, valid and binding obligations of each party.
 
In rendering our opinion, we have considered the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury Department regulations promulgated thereunder, pertinent judicial authorities, interpretive rulings of the Internal Revenue Service and such other authorities as we have considered relevant. It should be noted that statutes, regulations, judicial decisions and administrative interpretations are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. There can be no assurance, moreover, that the opinion expressed herein will be accepted by the Internal Revenue Service or, if challenged, by a court of law. A change in the authorities or the accuracy or completeness of any of the information, documents, certificates, records, statements, representations or assumptions on which our opinion is based could affect our conclusions.
 
Based upon the foregoing and in reliance thereon, and subject to the qualifications, exceptions, assumptions and limitations contained herein or in the Prospectus, we are of the opinion that, under current United States federal income tax law:

Except as set forth above, we express no opinion to any party as to any tax consequences, whether federal, state, local or foreign, of the Capital Securities or of any transaction related thereto. This opinion is expressed as of the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to such date or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue. We hereby consent to the use of our name under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus and the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit 8.1 to the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
 
Very truly yours,
 
/s/ Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP
