the Company may de-list the Securities from the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain an alternative admission to listing, trading and/or quotation of the Securities by another listing authority, exchange or system within or outside the European Union as it may decide.

This Note is a Global Security within the meaning of the Indenture hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of the Depository named below or a nominee of the Depository. This Note is not exchangeable for Notes registered in the name of a Person other than the Depository or its nominee except in the limited circumstances described herein and in the Indenture, and no transfer of this Note (other than a transfer of this Note as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository) may be registered except in the limited circumstances described herein.
Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. ("CDS") to Citigroup Inc. or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any certificate issued in respect thereof is registered in the name of CDS & CO., or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of CDS (and any payment is made to CDS & CO. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of CDS), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL since the registered holder hereof, CDS & CO., has an interest herein. This certificate is issued pursuant to a Master Letter of Representations of Citigroup Inc. to CDS, as such letter may be replaced or amended from time to time.
CITIGROUP INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CDS & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of C$_____________ on January 17, 2017, and until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment to pay interest thereon from and including January 17, 2007 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined herein) to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, to but excluding January 17, 2017, semi-annually in equal installments on the seventeenth day of January and July of each year, commencing July 17, 2007, at a fixed rate of 4.625% per annum (each such semi-annual payment date, an Interest Payment Date). The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid pursuant to the instructions of the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such interest, which shall be the January 1 and July 1 (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding each Interest Payment Date.
 
 
 
 
Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holder on such Record Date and may either be paid pursuant to the instructions of the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a subsequent Record Date, such subsequent Record Date to be not less than five days prior to the date of payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to holders of Notes of this series not less than 15 days prior to such subsequent Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
Interest will be payable semi-annually in equal installments and, in the case of any period other than a full semi-annual period, interest hereon will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year of 365 days or (in the case of a leap year) 366 days. All Canadian dollar amounts resulting from the calculations described in the preceding sentence will be rounded to the nearest cent.
If either an Interest Payment Date or a redemption date falls on a day that is not both a Toronto Business Day and a New York Business Day, the payment due on such date will be postponed to the next succeeding day that is both a Toronto Business Day and a New York Business Day, and no further interest will accrue in respect of such postponement. "Toronto Business Day" means any day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and are open for general business (including dealings in foreign currency deposits and foreign exchange) in Toronto. New York Business Day means any day on which commercial banks settle payments and are open for general business in The City of New York.
If a date for payment of interest or principal on the Note falls on a day that is not a business day in the place of payment, such payment will be made on the next succeeding business day in such place of payment as if made on the date such payment was due. No interest will accrue on any amounts payable for the period from and after the due date for payment of such interest or principal.
The Notes will be represented by beneficial interests in fully registered permanent global notes (the "Global Notes") without interest coupons attached, which will be registered in the name of CDS & Co. and deposited with CDS.
Beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be represented through book-entry accounts of financial institutions acting on behalf of beneficial owners as direct and indirect participants in CDS. Clearstream International (Clearstream) and the Euroclear System (Euroclear) will hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers' securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective Canadian subcustodians, each of which is a Canadian Schedule I chartered bank ("Canadian subcustodians"), which in turn will hold such interests in customers' securities accounts in the names of the Canadian subcustodians on the books of CDS.
 
 
 
 
All payments of principal and interest on the Notes will be made in Canadian dollars. Payments on the Global Notes will be made on behalf of the Company by the fiscal agent pursuant to the instructions of the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the relevant Record Date. All payments made by the fiscal agent on the Companys behalf shall discharge the liability of the Company under the Notes to the extent of the sums so paid.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or by the Fiscal Agent on behalf of the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
 
 
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

ATTEST:
By:___________________________________
Title: Assistant Secretary
 
 
 
This is one of the Notes of the series issued under the within-mentioned Indenture.
Dated: January 17, 2007
 
 
 
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company (the "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under the Indenture, dated as of March 15, 1987 (as amended and supplemented, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of C$400,000,000.
If an event of default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to Notes of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Note upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in Sections 11.03 and 11.04 thereof, which provisions apply to this Note.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, without the consent of the holders of the Securities, to establish, among other things, the form and terms of any series of Securities issuable thereunder by one or more supplemental indentures, and, with the consent of the holders of not less than 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of Securities at the time Outstanding which are affected thereby, to modify the Indenture or any supplemental indenture or the rights of the holders of Securities of such series to be affected, provided that no such modification will (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Securities, reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, reduce the principal amount thereof or the premium , if any, thereon, reduce the amount of the principal of Original Issue Discount Securities payable on any date, change the currency in which Securities are payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the maturity thereof without the consent of the holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities of any series, the consent of the holders of which is required for any such modification without the consent of the holders of all Securities of such series then outstanding, or (iii) modify, without the written consent of the Trustee, the rights, duties or immunities of the Trustee.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
This Note is a Global Security registered in the name of a nominee of the Depository. This Note is exchangeable for Notes registered in the name of a person other than the Depository or its nominee only in the limited circumstances hereinafter described. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for definitive Notes in certificated form, this Note may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository.
 
 
 
 
If CDS notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary in connection with the Global Notes or ceases to be a recognized clearing agency under the Securities Act (Ontario) or other applicable Canadian securities legislation, and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after receiving such notice or becoming aware that CDS is no longer so recognized, or if both Clearstream and Euroclear notify the Company that they are unwilling or unable to continue as a clearing system in connection with the Notes, or if the Company in its sole discretion decides to allow some or all of the Notes to be exchangeable for definitive securities in registered form, then the beneficial owners of Notes affected by such events will be notified through the relevant chain of intermediaries that definitive notes are available. Beneficial owners of affected book-entry notes will then be entitled (1) to receive physical delivery in certificated form of definitive notes equal in principal amount to their beneficial interest and (2) to have the definitive notes registered in their names. The definitive notes will be issued in denominations of C$100,000 and integral multiples of C$1,000 in excess thereof. Definitive notes will be registered in the name or names of the person or persons CDS, Euroclear and Clearstream specify in a written instruction to the registrar. CDS or Euroclear and Clearstream may base their written instruction upon directions they receive from their participants. Thereafter, the holders of the definitive notes will be recognized as the "holders" of the notes under the Indenture.
In the event definitive notes are issued, the holders of definitive notes will be able to receive payments of principal and interest on their notes at the office of the Company's paying agents maintained in Toronto and in London. Payment of principal of a definitive note may be made only against surrender of the note to one of the Company's paying agents. The Company also has the option of mailing checks to the registered holders of the notes.
In the event definitive notes are issued, the holders of definitive notes will be able to transfer their notes, in whole or in part, by surrendering the notes for registration of transfer at the office of Citibank Canada, Toronto office, or Citibank, N.A., London office, duly endorsed by or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the registrar. Upon surrender, the Company will execute, and the authenticating agent will authenticate and deliver, new notes to the designated transferee in the amount being transferred, and a new note for any amount not being transferred will be issued to the transferor. Such new notes will be delivered free of charge at the offices of Citibank, N.A. in London or Citibank Canada in Toronto, as requested by the owner of such new notes. The Company will not charge any fee for the registration of transfer or exchange, except that it may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any applicable tax or other governmental charge payable in connection with the transfer.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Fiscal Agent and any agent of the Company or the Fiscal Agent may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Fiscal Agent nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
 
 
 
The Company will pay additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") to the beneficial owner of any Note that is a non-United States person in order to ensure that every net payment on such Note will not be less, due to payment of U.S. withholding tax, than the amount then due and payable. For this purpose, a "net payment" on a Note means a payment by the Company or a paying agent, including payment of principal and interest, after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge of the United States. These Additional Amounts will constitute additional interest on the Note.
The Company will not be required to pay Additional Amounts, however, in any of the circumstances described in items (1) through (13) below.
 
 
 
 
For purposes of items (1) through (4) above, "beneficial owner" means a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the holder if the holder is an estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, corporation or other entity, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder.
 
 
 
 
Except as specifically provided herein, the Company will not be required to make any payment of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of such government.
As used in this Note, "United States person" means:
 
 
 
 
 
Additionally, "non-United States person" means a person who is not a United States person, and "United States" means the states of the United States of America and the District of Columbia, but excluding its territories and its possessions.
Except as provided below, the Notes may not be redeemed prior to maturity.
Any redemption of the Notes as set forth in clauses (1) or (2) above shall be in whole, and not in part, and will be made at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes Outstanding plus accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption. Holders shall be given not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior notice by the Trustee of the date fixed for such redemption.
 
 
 
 
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture. The Notes are governed by the laws of the State of New York.

The Issuer will pay to the Agents a remuneration for all services rendered hereunder by the Agents in connection with the Notes together with any expenses incurred as separately agreed upon by the Agents and the Issuer.
10.2 The Issuer will indemnify and hold harmless each of the Agents against any loss, liability or expense which it may incur or any claim, action or demand which may be made against it resulting from the negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of the Issuer (or its officers, employees or agents (other than the Agents and their officers, employees, and agents)) and arising out of or in connection with such Agents appointment or the exercise of its powers and duties hereunder without negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of such Agent.
10.3 Each Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Issuer or any claim, action or demand which may be made against the Issuer resulting from the negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of such Agent (or such Agents officers, employees or agents) and arising out of or in connection with such Agents duties hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances will any Agent be liable to the Issuer or any other person for any consequential loss (being loss of business, goodwill, opportunity or profit) even if advised to the possibility of such loss or damages.
10.4 The indemnities above shall survive the termination or expiry of this Agreement.
10.5 Each of the Agents shall be protected and shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, omitted or suffered in reliance upon any instruction or communication from the Issuer or any document reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been delivered, signed or sent by the proper party or parties in accordance with the provisions hereof, except such as may result from its own negligence or wilful misconduct or that of its officers, employees or agents.
10.6
 
In acting hereunder and in connection with the Notes, the Agents do not assume any relationship of agency and trust for the Noteholders, and shall not have any obligation towards them except that all funds held by the Fiscal Agent for payment of principal of or interest on the Notes shall be held exclusively for the benefit of and for payment to the Noteholders and shall be applied as set forth herein and in the Conditions. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, no Agent will be required to segregate any funds held by it hereunder from any of its other funds.
10.7
 
Nothing herein shall be deemed to require any Agent to advance its own funds in the performance of its duties hereunder.
10.8
 
The Agents may consult with legal and other professional advisers selected in good faith and satisfactory to them and the opinion of such advisers shall be full and complete protection in respect of any action taken, omitted or suffered hereunder in good faith and without negligence and in accordance with the opinion of such advisers.
10.9 The Agents shall be obliged to perform such duties and only such duties as are herein
specifically set forth, and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Agents. No Agent shall be under any obligation to take any action hereunder which it expects will result in any expense or liability of such Agent, the payment of which within a reasonable time is not, in its opinion, assured to it. The obligations of the Agents hereunder are several and not joint.

Each of the Fiscal Agent, Registrar and Principal Paying Agent in its capacity as such may be removed at any time by the giving to it of at least 30 days written notice to that effect signed on behalf of the Issuer specifying the date on which such removal shall become effective. Each of the Fiscal Agent, Registrar and Principal Paying Agent may at any time resign by giving at least 30 days written notice (unless the Issuer agrees to accept less notice) to that effect to the Issuer specifying the date on which such resignation shall become effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such resignation or removal shall take effect within 30 days before or after any due date for payment of any Notes or before a new Fiscal Agent, Registrar and Principal Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall have been appointed by the Issuer as hereinafter provided, and such new Agent shall have accepted such appointment. Any change in any Agent shall be notified by the Issuer to the other Agent(s).

12.2
 
The Issuer agrees with the Fiscal Agent that if, by the day falling 10 days before the expiry of any notice under Clause 12.1 above, the Issuer has not appointed a replacement Fiscal Agent, then the Fiscal Agent shall be entitled, on behalf of the Issuer, to appoint in its place any reputable financial institution of good standing and the Issuer shall not unreasonably object to such appointment.
12.3
 
Upon the effectiveness of the appointment of any successor Fiscal Agent, Registrar and Principal Paying Agent, as the case may be, pursuant to Clause 12.1, the Fiscal Agent, Registrar and Principal Paying Agent so removed shall cease to be a Fiscal Agent, Registrar and Principal Paying Agent, as the case may be, hereunder. Prior to the effectiveness of such appointment, the Fiscal Agent, Registrar and Principal Paying Agent shall hold all moneys deposited with it or held by it hereunder in respect of the Notes to the order of the respective successor Fiscal Agent, Registrar and Principal Paying Agent.
