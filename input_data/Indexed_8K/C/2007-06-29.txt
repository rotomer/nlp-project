The Securities shall be issuable as Registered Securities only. The Securities will be initially represented by one or more global Securities registered in the name of Citivic Nominees Limited, as nominee for, and in respect of interests held through, Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. and Clearstream International, for the notes of a series offered and sold outside the United States, and by one or more global Securities registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for The Depository Trust Company (DTC), for the notes of a series offered and sold inside the United States, as described in the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Securities. Beneficial interests in the Securities will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC, Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. and Clearstream International and their respective participants. Owners of beneficial interests in the Securities will be entitled to physical delivery of Securities in certificated form only under the limited circumstances described in the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement. Principal and interest on the Securities shall be payable in Japanese Yen; however, when interests in the notes are held through DTC, all payments in respect of such DTC notes will be made in U.S. dollars, unless the holder of a beneficial interest in the DTC notes elects to receive payment in Yen. The relevant provisions of Article Eleven of the Indenture relating to defeasance shall apply to the Securities.
 
All the provisions contained in the document entitled Citigroup Inc. Debt Securities  Underwriting Agreement  Basic Provisions and dated March 2, 2006 (the Basic Provisions), a copy of which you have previously received, are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety and shall be deemed to be a part of this Terms Agreement to the same extent as if the Basic Provisions had been set forth in full herein. Terms defined in the Basic Provisions are used herein as therein defined.
 
The Company agrees to use its best efforts to have the Securities approved for listing on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to maintain such listing so long as any of the Securities are outstanding, provided, however that:
 
(a)
if it is impracticable or unduly burdensome, in the good faith determination of the Company, to maintain such listing due to changes in listing requirements occurring after the date of the Prospectus Supplement, or
 
(b)
 
if the Transparency Directive (as defined in the Prospectus) is implemented in Luxembourg in a manner that would require the Company to publish financial information according to accounting principles or standards that are materially different from United States generally accepted accounting principles,
the Company may de-list the Securities from the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain an alternative admission to listing, trading and/or quotation of the Securities by another listing authority, exchange or system within or outside the European Union as it may decide. If such an alternative admission is not available or is, in the Companys opinion, unduly burdensome, such an alternative admission will not be obtained, and the Company shall have no further obligation in respect of any listing, trading or quotation for the Securities.

This Note is a Global Security within the meaning of the Indenture hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of the Depository named below or a nominee of the Depository. This Note is not exchangeable for Notes registered in the name of a Person other than the Depository or its nominee except in the limited circumstances described herein and in the Indenture, and no transfer of this Note (other than a transfer of this Note as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository) may be registered except in the limited circumstances described herein.
Unless this certificate is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation (the "Depository"), to the Company or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any certificate issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of the Depository (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of the Depository), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
CITIGROUP INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of 0 (or such other principal sum as has been most lately endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests hereto) on June ____, _____ and to pay interest thereon from and including June 26, 2007 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, in equal amounts semi-annually on June 26 and December 26 of each year, commencing December 26, 2007, at the rate of ____% per annum, in the amount of Yen _____ per each Yen 100,000 principal amount of this Note, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such interest, which shall be the June 15 or December 15 (whether or not a Business Day) next preceding such Interest Payment Date.
 
Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holder on such Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a subsequent Record Date, such subsequent Record Date to be not less than five days prior to the date of payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to holders of Notes of this series not less than 15 days prior to such subsequent Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
In the case of any period of less than six months and any date other than an Interest Payment Date, interest hereon will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the relevant period and a year of 365 days.
If either a date for payment of principal or interest on the Notes or the Maturity of the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the related payment of principal or interest will be made on the next succeeding Business Day as if made on the date the payment was due. No interest will accrue on any amounts payable for the period from and after the date for payment of principal or interest on the Notes or the Maturity of the Notes. For these purposes, "Business Day" means any day which is a day on which commercial banks and foreign exchange markets settle payments and are open for general business (including dealings in foreign exchange and foreign currency deposits) in (a) the relevant place of payment and (b) each of The City of New York, Tokyo and London.
Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in London or The City of New York in Japanese Yen, provided that holders of interests in this Note through The Depository Trust Company will receive payment in United States dollars unless they make an election to receive payment in Japanese Yen in accordance with the procedures of The Depository Trust Company and the Fiscal Agency Agreement dated as of June 26, 2007 (the "Fiscal Agency Agreement"), in which case the exchange agent under the Fiscal Agency Agreement will convert the Japanese Yen paid by the Company into U.S. dollars in accordance with the Fiscal Agency Agreement.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee or by an authenticating agent on behalf of the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.
This is one of the Notes of the series issued under the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company (the "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under the Indenture, dated as of March 15, 1987 (as amended and supplemented to date, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of __________.
So long as the Notes of this series are in the form of Global Securities only, all Notes of this series will collectively be evidenced (a) by this Global Note (the "DTC Global Note") and (b) by the Global Security of this series registered in the name of Citivic Nominees Limited (the "International Global Note"). The DTC Global Note and the International Global Note will at all times collectively represent the aggregate principal amount of this series outstanding from time to time. If at any time a portion of the International Global Note is exchanged for an interest in the DTC Global Note, the principal amount of the DTC Global Note shall be increased by the amount of such portion, and the DTC Global Note shall be endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests thereto to reflect such principal increase, subject to the limitation that in no event may the principal amount of the DTC Global Note be greater than the equivalent in U.S. dollars of $500,000,000. If at any time a portion of the DTC Global Note is exchanged for an interest in the International Global Note, the principal amount of the DTC Global Note shall be decreased by the amount of such portion, and the DTC Global Note shall be endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests thereto to reflect such principal decrease. To ascertain the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests attached to the DTC Global Note, inquiry shall be made of the exchange agent under the Fiscal Agency Agreement, and the U.S. dollar equivalent quoted by such exchange agent (and the date of such quote) shall be noted on such Schedule of Exchanges of Interests next to the corresponding Yen amount.
If an event of default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to Notes of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Note upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in Sections 11.03 and 11.04 thereof, which provisions apply to this Note.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, without the consent of the holders of Securities, to establish, among other things, the form and terms of any series of Securities issuable thereunder by one or more supplemental indentures, and, with the consent of the holders of not less than 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of Securities at the time Outstanding which are affected thereby, to modify the Indenture or any supplemental indenture or the rights of the holders of Securities of such series to be affected, provided that no such modification will (x) extend the fixed maturity of any Securities, reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, reduce the principal amount thereof or the premium, if any, thereon, reduce the amount of the principal of Original Issue Discount Securities payable on any date, change the currency in which Securities are payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the maturity thereof, without the consent of the holder of each Security so affected, or (y) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities of any series the consent of the holders of which is required for any such modification without the consent of the holders of all Securities of such series then Outstanding, or (z) modify, without the written consent of the Trustee, the rights, duties or immunities of the Trustee.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
This Note is a Global Security registered in the name of a nominee of the Depository. This Note is exchangeable for Notes registered in the name of a person other than the Depository or its nominee only in the limited circumstances hereinafter described. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for definitive Notes in certificated form, this Note may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository.
The Notes represented by this Global Security are exchangeable for definitive Notes in certificated form of like tenor as such Notes in denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples thereof only if (i) the Depository notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for the DTC Global Note or (ii) the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or (iii) both the Euroclear System and Clearstream Banking, socit anonyme, notify the Company that they are unwilling or unable to continue as a clearing system for the International Global Note or (iv) the Company in its sole discretion decides to allow the Notes to be exchanged for definitive Notes in registered form. Any Notes that are exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence are exchangeable for certificated Notes issuable in authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Depository shall direct. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of definitive Notes in certificated form is registrable in the register maintained by the Company for such purpose, upon surrender of the definitive Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and interest on the definitive Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the registrar duly executed by, the holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. Subject to the foregoing, this Note is not exchangeable, except for a Global Security or Global Securities of this issue of the same principal amount to be registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Company will pay additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") to the beneficial owner of any Note that is a non-United States person in order to ensure that every net payment on such Note will not be less, due to payment of U.S. withholding tax, than the amount then due and payable. For this purpose, a "net payment" on a Note means a payment by the Company or a paying agent, including payment of principal and interest, after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge of the United States. These Additional Amounts will constitute additional interest on the Note.
The Company will not be required to pay Additional Amounts, however, in any of the circumstances described in items (1) through (13) below.
 
 
For purposes of items (1) through (4) above, "beneficial owner" means a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the holder if the holder is an estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, corporation or other entity, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder.
 
 
 
Except as specifically provided herein, the Company will not be required to make any payment of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of such government.
 
As used in this Note, "United States person" means:
 
Additionally, "non-United States person" means a person who is not a United States person, and "United States" means the states of the United States of America and the District of Columbia, but excluding its territories and its possessions.
Except as provided below, the Notes may not be redeemed prior to maturity.

The Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes if:
 
 
 
Any redemption of the Notes as set forth in clauses (1) or (2) above shall be in whole, and not in part, and will be made at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes Outstanding plus accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption. Holders shall be given not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior notice by the Trustee of the date fixed for such redemption.

Assistant Secretary
This is one of the Notes of the series issued under the within-mentioned Indenture.
Dated: June 26, 2007
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company (the Notes), issued and to be issued in one or more series under the Indenture, dated as of March 15, 1987 (as amended and supplemented to date, the Indenture), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the Trustee, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of __________.
So long as the Notes of this series are in the form of Global Securities only, all Notes of this series will collectively be evidenced (a) by the Global Securities for this series registered in the name of Cede & Co. and bearing registration number R-_____-DTC-A (the DTC Global Note) and (b) by this Global Note (the International Global Note). The DTC Global Note and the International Global Note will at all times collectively represent the aggregate principal amount of this series outstanding from time to time. If at any time a portion of the International Global Note is exchanged for an interest in the DTC Global Note, the principal amount of the DTC Global Note shall be increased by the amount of such portion, and the DTC Global Note shall be endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests thereto to reflect such principal increase, subject to the limitation that in no event may the principal amount of the DTC Global Note be greater than the equivalent in U.S. dollars of $500,000,000. If at any time a portion of the DTC Global Note is exchanged for an interest in the International Global Note, the principal amount of the DTC Global Note shall be decreased by the amount of such portion, and the DTC Global Note shall be endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests thereto to reflect such principal decrease. To ascertain the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount endorsed on the Schedule of Exchanges of Interests attached to the DTC Global Note, inquiry shall be made of the exchange agent under the Fiscal Agency Agreement, and the U.S. dollar equivalent quoted by such exchange agent (and the date of such quote) shall be noted on such Schedule of Exchanges of Interests next to the corresponding Yen amount.
If an event of default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to Notes of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Note upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in Sections 11.03 and 11.04 thereof, which provisions apply to this Note.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, without the consent of the holders of Securities, to establish, among other things, the form and terms of any series of Securities issuable thereunder by one or more supplemental indentures, and, with the consent of the holders of not less than 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of Securities at the time Outstanding which are affected thereby, to modify the Indenture or any supplemental indenture or the rights of the holders of Securities of such series to be affected, provided that no such modification will (x) extend the fixed maturity of any Securities, reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, reduce the principal amount thereof or the premium, if any, thereon, reduce the amount of the principal of Original Issue Discount Securities payable on any date, change the currency in which Securities are payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the maturity thereof, without the consent of the holder of each Security so affected, or (y) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities of any series the consent of the holders of which is required for any such modification without the consent of the holders of all Securities of such series then Outstanding, or (z) modify, without the written consent of the Trustee, the rights, duties or immunities of the Trustee.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
This Note is a Global Security registered in the name of a nominee of the Depository. This Note is exchangeable for Notes registered in the name of a person other than the Depository or its nominee only in the limited circumstances hereinafter described. Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for definitive Notes in certificated form, this Note may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository.
The Notes represented by this Global Security are exchangeable for definitive Notes in certificated form of like tenor as such Notes in denominations of 100,000 and integral multiples thereof only if (i) the Depository notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for the DTC Global Note or (ii) the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or (iii) both the Euroclear System and Clearstream Banking, socit anonyme, notify the Company that they are unwilling or unable to continue as a clearing system for the International Global Note or (iv) the Company in its sole discretion decides to allow the Notes to be exchanged for definitive Notes in registered form. Any Notes that are exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence are exchangeable for certificated Notes issuable in authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Depository shall direct. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of definitive Notes in certificated form is registrable in the register maintained by the Company for such purpose, upon surrender of the definitive Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and interest on the definitive Note are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the registrar duly executed by, the holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. Subject to the foregoing, this Note is not exchangeable, except for a Global Security or Global Securities of this issue of the same principal amount to be registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Company will pay additional amounts (Additional Amounts) to the beneficial owner of any Note that is a non-United States person in order to ensure that every net payment on such Note will not be less, due to payment of U.S. withholding tax, than the amount then due and payable. For this purpose, a net payment on a Note means a payment by the Company or a paying agent, including payment of principal and interest, after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge of the United States. These Additional Amounts will constitute additional interest on the Note.
The Company will not be required to pay Additional Amounts, however, in any of the circumstances described in items (1) through (13) below.
 
 
For purposes of items (1) through (4) above, beneficial owner means a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the holder if the holder is an estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, corporation or other entity, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder.

As used in this Note, United States person means:
 
Additionally, non-United States person means a person who is not a United States person, and United States means the states of the United States of America and the District of Columbia, but excluding its territories and its possessions.
Except as provided below, the Notes may not be redeemed prior to maturity.

Holders shall be given not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior notice by the Trustee of the date fixed for such redemption.
