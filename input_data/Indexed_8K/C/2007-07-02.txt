The Capital Securities and the Common Securities (as defined herein) are to be issued pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated declaration of trust, dated as of June 28, 2007 (the Declaration), among Citigroup Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company and, together with the Trust, the Offerors), as sponsor, the trustees named therein (the Citigroup Capital Trustees) and the holders from time to time of undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. The Declaration is qualified as an indenture under the Trust Indenture Act. Pursuant to the Declaration, the number of Citigroup Capital Trustees will initially be five. Three of the Citigroup Capital Trustees (the Regular Trustees) will be persons who are employees or officers of the Company. The fourth Citigroup Capital Trustee will be a financial institution unaffiliated with the Company that will serve as property trustee under the Declaration and as indenture trustee with respect to the Capital Securities for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act (the Institutional Trustee). The fifth Citigroup Capital Trustee will be a financial institution or an affiliate thereof which maintains a principal place of business in the State of Delaware, meeting the requirements of the Delaware Act (the Delaware Trustee). Initially, The Bank of New York, a New York banking association (BoNY), will act as the Institutional Trustee and The Bank of New York (Delaware), a banking association with its principal place of business in the State of Delaware, will act as the Delaware Trustee until removed or replaced by the holder of the Common Securities. The Capital Securities will be guaranteed by the Company on a subordinated basis with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption or otherwise (the Guarantee) pursuant to the Capital Securities Guarantee Agreement dated as of June 28, 2007 (the Guarantee Agreement) between the Company and BoNY, as Trustee (the Guarantee Trustee).
 
The assets of the Trust will consist of 6.829% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due June 28, 2067 (the Subordinated Debentures) of the Company which will be issued under an indenture, dated as of June 28, 2007 (as supplemented, the Indenture), between the Company and BoNY, as Trustee (the Indenture Trustee). Under certain circumstances, the Subordinated Debentures will be distributable to the holders of undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust. The Capital Securities, the Guarantee and the Subordinated Debentures are referred to herein as the Securities.
 
The Offerors wish to confirm as follows their agreement with you and the other several Underwriters listed on Schedule I on whose behalf you are acting, in connection with the several purchases of the Capital Securities by the Underwriters. To the extent there are no additional Underwriters listed on Schedule I other than you, the term Representatives as used herein shall mean you, as Underwriters, and the terms Representatives and Underwriters shall mean either the singular or plural as the context requires. Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Exchange Act on or before the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms amend, amendment or supplement with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.

Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying partys choice at the indemnifying partys expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below);
provided, however
, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying partys election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
 
(d)
 
In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the Trust and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively 
Losses
) to which the Company, the Trust and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Trust on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Capital Securities;
provided, however
, that in no case shall (i) any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Capital Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Capital Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the Trust and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Trust on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and the Trust shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Trust, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company and the Trust on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Trust and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company, as applicable, within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company and the Regular Trustees who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Trust, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

(a)
(
i)
 
The Debenture Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Trust) by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of
nolo contendere
or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Company Indemnified Person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
 
(ii)
 
The Debenture Issuer shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any Company Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Trust to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Company Indemnified Person against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust and except that no such indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such Company Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
 
37
 
(iii)
 
To the extent that a Company Indemnified Person shall be successful on the merits or otherwise (including dismissal of an action without prejudice or the settlement of an action without admission of liability) in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified, to the full extent permitted by law, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith.
 
(iv)
 
Any indemnification under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Debenture Issuer only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Company Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (i) and (ii). Such determination shall be made (1) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of such Regular Trustees who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the Common Security Holder of the Trust.
 
(v)
 
Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Company Indemnified Person in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 10.4(a) shall be paid by the Debenture Issuer in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Company Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Debenture Issuer as authorized in this Section 10.4(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Debenture Issuer if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Regular Trustees by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees, (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested Regular Trustees so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iii) the Common Security Holder of the Trust, that, based upon the facts known to the Regular Trustees, counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time such determination is made, such Company Indemnified Person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Company Indemnified Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. In no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Regular Trustees, independent legal counsel or Common Security Holder reasonably determine that such person deliberately breached his duty to the Trust or its Common or Capital Security Holders.
 
38
 
(vi)
 
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 10.4(a) shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors of the Debenture Issuer or Capital Security Holders of the Trust or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. All rights to indemnification under this Section 10.4(a) shall be deemed to be provided by a contract between the Debenture Issuer and each Company Indemnified Person who serves in such capacity at any time while this Section 10.4(a) is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Section 10.4(a) shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing.
 
(vii)
 
The Debenture Issuer may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Company Indemnified Person against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Debenture Issuer would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a).
 
(viii)
 
For purposes of this Section 10.4(a), references to "the Trust" shall include, in addition to the resulting or surviving entity, any constituent entity (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger, so that any person who is or was a director, trustee, officer or employee of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another entity, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 10.4(a) with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as he would have with respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued.
 
(ix)
 
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 10.4(a) shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Company Indemnified Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
 
(b)
 
The Debenture Issuer agrees to indemnify the (i) Institutional Trustee, (ii) the Delaware Trustee, (iii) any Affiliate of the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, and (iv) any officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, employees, representatives, custodians, nominees or agents of the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee (each of the Persons in (i) through (iv) being referred to as a "Fiduciary Indemnified Person") for, and to hold each Fiduciary Indemnified Person harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration or the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of defending itself against or investigating any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The obligation to indemnify as set forth in this Section 10.4(b) shall survive the resignation or removal of the Institutional Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, as the case may be, and the satisfaction and discharge of this Declaration.

No Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee, or the Institutional Trustee shall be obligated to present any particular investment or other opportunity to the Trust even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Trust, could be taken by the Trust, and any Covered Person, the Sponsor, the Delaware Trustee and the Institutional Trustee shall have the right to take for its own account (individually or as a partner or fiduciary) or to recommend to others any such particular investment or other opportunity. Any Covered Person, the Delaware Trustee and the Institutional Trustee may engage or be interested in any financial or other transaction with the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor, or may act as depositary for, trustee or agent for, or act on any committee or body of holders of, securities or other obligations of the Sponsor or its Affiliates.

The Trust shall request, and the Holders shall provide to the Trust, such forms or certificates as are necessary to establish an exemption from withholding with respect to each Holder, and any representations and forms as shall reasonably be requested by the Trust to assist it in determining the extent of, and in fulfilling, its withholding obligations. The Regular Trustees shall file required forms with applicable jurisdictions and, unless an exemption from withholding is properly established by a Holder, shall remit amounts withheld with respect to the Holder to applicable jurisdictions. To the extent that the Trust is required to withhold and pay over any amounts to any authority with respect to distributions or allocations to any Holder, the amount withheld shall be deemed to be a distribution in the amount of the withholding to the Holder. In the event of any claimed overwithholding, Holders shall be limited to an action against the applicable jurisdiction. If the amount required to be withheld was not withheld from actual Distributions made, the Trust may reduce subsequent Distributions by the amount of such withholding.

The Regular Trustees shall call a meeting of the Holders of such class if directed to do so by the Holders of Securities representing at least 10% in liquidation amount of such class of Securities. Such direction shall be given by delivering to the Regular Trustees one or more calls in a writing stating that the signing Holders of Securities wish to call a meeting and indicating the general or specific purpose for which the meeting is to be called. Any Holders of Securities calling a meeting shall specify in writing the Security Certificates held by the Holders of Securities exercising the right to call a meeting and only those Securities specified shall be counted for purposes of determining whether the required percentage set forth in the second sentence of this paragraph has been met.
 
(b)
 
Except to the extent otherwise provided in the terms of the Securities, the following provisions shall apply to meetings of Holders of Securities:
 
(i)
 
notice of any such meeting shall be given to all the Holders of Securities having a right to vote thereat at least 7 days and not more than 60 days before the date of such meeting.

(iv)
 
unless the Statutory Trust Act, this Declaration, the terms of the Securities, the Trust Indenture Act or the listing rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are then listed or trading, otherwise provides, the Regular Trustees, in their sole discretion, shall establish all other provisions relating to meetings of Holders of Securities, including notice of the time, place or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be voted on by any Holders of Securities, waiver of any such notice, action by consent without a meeting, the establishment of a record date, quorum requirements, voting in person or by proxy or any other matter with respect to the exercise of any such right to vote.

Pursuant to Section 7.1 of the Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, dated as of June 28, 2007 (as amended from time to time, the "Declaration"), the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions, preferences and other terms and provisions of the Capital Securities and the Common Securities are set out below (each capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning set forth in the Declaration or, if not defined in such Declaration, as defined in the Prospectus referred to below):
 
1.
 
Designation and Number
.
 
(a)
 
Capital Securities
. 500,000 Capital Securities of the Trust with an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of FIVE HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS STERLING (500,000,000), and a liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of 1,000 per capital security, are hereby designated for the purposes of identification only as "6.829% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Capital Securities" (the "Capital Securities"). The Capital Security Certificates evidencing the Capital Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 and Exhibit A-2 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice or to conform to the rules of any stock exchange on which the Capital Securities are listed.
 
(b)
 
Common Securities
. 50 Common Securities of the Trust with an aggregate liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING (50,000), and a liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of 1,000 per common security, are hereby designated for the purposes of identification only as "6.829% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Common Securities" (the "Common Securities"). The Common Security Certificates evidencing the Common Securities shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-3 to the Declaration, with such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice.
 
2.
 
Distributions
.
 
(a)
 
Distributions on the Securities will be cumulative, and will be payable until redemption on the stated liquidation amount of 1,000 per Security (i) from the date hereof to but excluding June 28, 2017 at an annual rate of 6.829% payable semi-annually in arrears in equal installments on June 28 and December 28 of each year, beginning on December 28, 2007 (the "First Coupon Rate"), (ii) from and including June 28, 2017 to but excluding June 28, 2037, at an annual rate equal to Three-Month Sterling LIBOR plus 0.8875%, payable quarterly in arrears on March 28, June 28, September 28 and December 28 of each year, beginning on September 28, 2017 (the "Second Coupon Rate") and (iii) from and including June 28, 2037, at an annual rate equal to Three-Month Sterling LIBOR plus 1.8875%, payable quarterly in arrears on March 28, June 28, September 28 and December 28 of each year beginning on September 28, 2037 (the "Third Coupon Rate", and together with the First Coupon Rate and the Second Coupon Rate, the "Coupon Rate"), such rates being the rates of interest payable on the Debentures to be held by the Institutional Trustee. Distributions in arrears beyond the first date such Distributions are payable (or would be payable, if not for any Extension Period (as defined below) or default by the Debenture Issuer on the Debentures) will bear interest thereon compounded quarterly or semi-annually, as applicable, at the then applicable Coupon Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law). A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee and to the extent the Institutional Trustee has funds available therefor. The amount of Distributions payable for any period ending on or prior to June 28, 2017 that is not a full semi-annual interest period will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days from and including the date on which the interest begins to accrue during the relevant period to but excluding the scheduled date on which the interest is payable, divided by the product of (a) the actual number of days in the relevant interest period and (b) two. The amount of interest payable for any interest period commencing on or after June 28, 2017 will be computed on the basis of a 365-day year, or, in the case of a leap-year, a 366-day year, and the actual number of days elapsed.
 
 
I-1
 
(b)
 
When, as and if available for payment, Distributions will be made by the Institutional Trustee, except as otherwise described below. The Debenture Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Debentures by extending the interest payment period from time to time on the Debentures for a period not exceeding 10 consecutive years (each an "Extension Period"), during which Extension Period no interest shall be due and payable on the Debentures, provided, that no Extension Period may extend beyond the date of maturity of the Debentures. As a consequence of the Debenture Issuer's extension of the interest payment period, Distributions will also be deferred. Despite such deferral, Distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon (to the extent permitted by applicable law) at the then applicable Coupon Rate compounded quarterly or semi-annually, as applicable, during any such Extension Period. In the event that the Debenture Issuer exercises its right to extend the interest payment period, then (a) the Debenture Issuer and any subsidiary of the Debenture Issuer shall not declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto (other than (i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Debenture Issuer in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, (ii) purchases of shares of common stock of the Debenture Issuer pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the extension period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan (iii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Debenture Issuer's capital stock for any other class or series of the Debenture Issuer's capital stock, (iv) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Debenture Issuer's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged), or (v) the purchase of Debenture Issuer's capital stock in connection with the distribution thereof; and (b) the Debenture Issuer and any subsidiary of the Debenture Issuer will not make any payment of interest, principal or premium on, or repay, repurchase or redeem, any debt securities or guarantees issued by the Debenture Issuer that rank pari passu with or junior to the Debentures (other than (i) any payment of current or deferred interest on securities that rank pari passu with the Debentures that is made pro rata to the amounts due on such securities (including the Debentures), provided that any such payments of deferred interest are made in accordance with the Alternative Payment Mechanism (as defined below), (ii) any payments of deferred interest on securities that rank pari passu with the Debentures that, if not made, would give rise to an event of default permitting acceleration of such securities or (iii) any repayment or redemption of a security necessary to avoid a breach of the instrument governing the same). The foregoing, however, will not apply to any stock dividends paid by the Debenture Issuer where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid. In addition, the Debenture Issuer may pay current interest at any time with cash from any source. Prior to the termination of any such Extension Period, the Debenture Issuer may further extend such Extension Period; provided, that such Extension Period, together with all such previous and further extensions thereof, may not exceed 10 consecutive years; provided further, that no Extension Period may extend beyond the maturity of the Debentures. Payments of deferred Distributions and accrued interest thereon will be payable to Holders as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the first record date before the end of the Extension Period. Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of all amounts then due, the Debenture Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements. The Regular Trustees will give notice to each Holder of any Extension Period upon their receipt of notice thereof from the Debenture Issuer.
 
I-2
 
(c)
 
If the Debenture Issuer does not pay all accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures for a period of five consecutive years or if the Debenture Issuer pays current interest on the Debentures during an Extension Period, it will be subject to the "Alternative Payment Mechanism," whereby the Debenture Issuer will be obliged to continuously use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell shares of its common stock (including treasury shares). The Debenture Issuer will notify the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or its successor as the Debenture Issuers primary federal banking regulator (collectively, the Federal Reserve) (1) of the commencement of any Extension Period, (2) of the fifth anniversary of the commencement of an Extension period or earlier payment of current interest on the Debentures during an Extension Period and (3) of its intention to sell shares of its common stock and/or Qualified Warrants (as defined below) and to apply the net proceeds from such sale to pay deferred interest on the Debentures at least 25 Business Days in advance of the relevant payment date (or such longer period as may be required by the Federal Reserve or by other supervisory action). The Debenture Issuer may pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures on or prior to the next interest payment date using only the net proceeds (after underwriters or placement agents fees, commissions or discounts and other expenses relating to the issuances) of such sales received by the Debenture Issuer during the 180-day period prior to that interest payment date, except that the Debenture Issuer may pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures with cash from any source (i) upon the maturity of the Debentures, (ii) during the occurrence and continuation of a Supervisory Event (as defined in the Indenture) or (iii) if an Event of Default and Acceleration under the Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing. Corresponding Distributions will be made on the Securities. If (1) a Supervisory Event or (2) a Market Disruption Event (as defined in the Indenture) shall have occurred and be continuing; then the Debenture Issuer will be excused from its obligation to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell its common stock and apply the net proceeds of such sale to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures. During the occurrence of a Supervisory Event, the Debenture Issuer will, no later than 30 Business Days prior to each interest payment date, notify the Federal Reserve of its intention to both (1) issue or sell shares of common stock and (2) to apply the net proceeds from such sale to pay deferred interest on the Debentures, and shall only take any such actions if the Federal Reserve does not disapprove of any such actions within ten (10) Business Days after the Debenture Issuer gives such notice to the Federal Reserve. The obligation of the Debenture Issuer to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell its common stock and apply the net proceeds of such sale to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures shall resume at such time as no Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event exists or is continuing. The Debenture Issuer is not permitted to sell shares of common stock in excess of a number of shares of common stock which at June 28, 2007 is equal to 55,000,000 (the "Share Cap Amount"), for the purpose of satisfying the Alternative Payment Mechanism or otherwise paying deferred interest on the Debentures then outstanding. If the issued and outstanding shares of common stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, then the Share Cap Amount shall be correspondingly adjusted. The Debenture Issuer shall increase the Share Cap Amount (including through the increase of its authorized share capital, if necessary) to an amount that would allow the Debenture Issuer to raise sufficient proceeds to satisfy its obligations to pay deferred interest in full at the end of the first year of an Extension Period (and on each subsequent anniversary of the end of the first year of an Extension Period to the extent that an Extension Period would last more than one year), if the then-current Share Cap Amount would not allow the Debenture Issuer to raise sufficient proceeds to satisfy its obligations to pay deferred interest (including compounded interest to that date) assuming a price per share equal to the average trading price of the Debenture Issuer's common shares over the ten-trading-day period preceding such date; provided that the Debenture Issuer will not be obligated to increase the Share Cap Amount above 180,000,000 shares. Until the tenth anniversary of the commencement of an Extension Period, a Default will occur if the Debenture Issuer does not increase the Share Cap Amount to an amount that is greater than 55,000,000 shares when required to do so as described above; provided that no Default will occur if the Debenture Issuer has increased the share cap amount to 180,000,000 shares. The Debenture Issuer will not be obligated to issue common stock prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of an Extension Period if the gross proceeds of any issuance of common stock and Qualified Warrants applied to pay deferred interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism, together with the gross proceeds of all prior issuances of common stock and Qualified Warrants applied since the commencement of the Extension Period, would exceed an amount equal to 2% of the product of (1) the average of the Current Stock Market Prices (as defined in the Indenture) of the Debenture Issuer's common stock on the 10 consecutive trading days ending on the fourth trading day immediately preceding the date of issuance by the Debenture Issuer of common stock applied to pay deferred interest on the Debentures pursuant to the Alternative Payment Mechanism and (2) the total number of issued and outstanding shares of the Debenture Issuer's common stock as of the date of the Debenture Issuer's publicly available consolidated financial statements (the APM Maximum Obligation). Once the Debenture Issuer reaches the APM Maximum Obligation for an Extension Period, the Debenture Issuer will not be obligated to issue more common stock or Qualified Warrants in satisfaction of the Alternative Payment Mechanism prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of an Extension Period even if the Current Stock Market Price of the Debenture Issuer's common stock or the number of outstanding shares of its common stock subsequently increase. The APM Maximum Obligation will cease to apply following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of an Extension Period, at which point the Debenture Issuer must repay any deferred interest, regardless of the time at which it was deferred, using proceeds from sales of the Debenture Issuer's common stock, including treasury shares, subject to any Market Disruption Event, Supervisory Event, and the Share Cap Amount. If the APM Maximum Obligation has been reached during an Extension Period and the Debenture Issuer subsequently repays all deferred interest, the APM Maximum Obligation will cease to apply at the termination of such Extension Period and will not apply again unless and until the Debenture Issuer starts a new Extension Period. "Qualified Warrants" means warrants for the Debenture Issuer's common stock on their date of issuance that (1) have an exercise price greater than the Current Stock Market Price of the Debenture Issuer's common stock, and (2) the Debenture Issuer is not entitled to redeem for cash and the holders are not entitled to require the Debenture Issuer to repurchase for cash in any circumstances.
 
I-3
 
(d)
 
Distributions on the Securities will be payable to the Holders thereof as they appear on the books and records of the Trust at the close of business on the relevant record dates. While the Capital Securities remain in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates shall be one Business Day prior to the relevant payment dates which payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Debentures. Subject to any applicable laws and regulations and the provisions of the Declaration, each such payment in respect of the Capital Securities will be made as described under the heading "Description of the Capital Securities -- Book-Entry Only Issuance" in the Prospectus dated June 22, 2007 (the "Prospectus"), of the Trust included in the Registration Statement on Form S-3 of the Sponsor, the Trust and certain other statutory trusts. The relevant record dates for the Common Securities shall be the same record date as for the Capital Securities. If the Capital Securities shall not continue to remain in book-entry only form, the relevant record dates for the Capital Securities shall conform to the rules of any securities exchange on which the securities are listed and, if none, shall be selected by the Regular Trustees, which payment dates shall correspond to the interest payment dates on the Debentures. Distributions payable on any Securities that are not punctually paid on any Distribution payment date, as a result of the Debenture Issuer having failed to make a payment under the Debentures, will cease to be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the special record date or other specified date determined in accordance with the Indenture. If any date on or prior to June 28, 2017 on which Distributions are payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay). In the event that any date on or after June 28, 2017 on which Distributions are payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.
 
 
(e)
 
The currency for payment for the Securities is Sterling and so long as interests in the Capital Securities are held through Euroclear or Clearstream, all payments in respect of such Capital Securities will be made in Sterling. However, when interests in the Capital Securities are held through DTC, all payments in respect of such DTC Capital Securities will be made in U.S. dollars, unless the holder of a beneficial interest in the DTC Capital Securities elects to receive payment in Sterling. As determined by the exchange agent under the terms of the Agency Agreement, in accordance with reasonable market practice, the amount of U.S. dollars payable in respect of any particular payment under the DTC Capital Securities will be equal to the amount of the Sterling/U.S.$ rate of exchange prevailing as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the day which is two Business Days prior to the relevant payment date, less any costs incurred by the exchange agent for such conversion (to be shared pro rata among the holders of DTC Capital Securities accepting U.S. dollar payments in the proportion of their respective holdings), all in accordance with the Agency Agreement. If an exchange rate bid quotation is not available, the exchange agent shall obtain a bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank in London selected by the exchange agent for such purpose after consultation with Citigroup. If no bid quotation from a leading foreign exchange bank is available, payment will be in Sterling to the account or accounts specified by DTC to the exchange agent. Notwithstanding the above, a holder of a beneficial interest in the DTC Capital Securities may elect to receive payments under such DTC Capital Securities in Sterling by notifying the DTC participant through which its DTC Capital Securities are held on or prior to the applicable record date of (1) such investors election to receive all or a portion of such payment in Sterling and (2) wire instructions to a relevant foreign currency account outside the United States. For purposes of this Section 2(e) only, the DTC record date for election to receive payments under the DTC Capital Securities in Sterling will be the eighth New York Business Day prior to the relevant date for payment of distributions. DTC must be notified of such election and wire transfer instructions on or prior to the third New York Business Day after such DTC record date for any payment of distributions and on or prior to the twelfth day prior to the payment of principal on the Capital Securities. DTC will notify the Paying Agent of such election and wire transfer instructions on or prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the fifth New York Business Day after such DTC record date for any payment of distributions and on or prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the tenth day prior to the payment of principal on the Capital Securities. No election to receive payments under the DTC Capital Securities in Sterling may be made except according to the procedures outlined above and once such election has been properly made it is irrevocable. For purposes of this paragraph, New York Business Day means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in New York City are authorized or required by law or executive order to close.

(6) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Capital Security is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the failure of the beneficial owner or any other person to comply with applicable certification, identification, documentation or other information reporting requirements; provided, however that this exception to the obligation to pay Additional Amounts will only apply if compliance with such reporting requirements is required by statute or regulation of the United States or by an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge.
 
I-6
 
(7) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Capital Security is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is collected or imposed by any method other than by withholding from a payment on a Capital Security by Citigroup or a Paying Agent.
 
(8) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Capital Security is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of a change in law, regulation, or administrative or judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later.
 
(9) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Capital Security is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the presentation by the beneficial owner of a Capital Security for payment more than 30 days after the date on which such payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later.

(11) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Capital Security is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any Paying Agent from a payment of principal or interest on a Capital Security if such payment can be made without such withholding by any other Paying Agent.
 
(12) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Capital Security is reduced as a result of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is required to be made pursuant to any European Union directive on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced to conform to, any such directive.
 
(13) Additional Amounts will not be payable if a payment on a Capital Security is reduced as a result of any combination of items (1) through (12) above.
 
Except as specifically provided in this Section 2(g), the Trust will not be required to make or procure any payment of any tax, assessment or other governmental or a political subdivision or taxing authority of such government.

Prior to any such Liquidation Distribution, the Debenture Issuer will obtain any required regulatory approval.
 
I-7
 
(b)

Redemption and Distribution
.
 
(a)
 
Upon the repayment of the Debentures, whether at maturity or upon redemption (either at the option of the Debenture Issuer or pursuant to a Special Event as described below), the proceeds from such repayment or payment shall be simultaneously applied to redeem Securities having an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures so repaid or redeemed. Holders shall be given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice of such redemption. Prior to any such redemption, the Debenture Issuer will obtain any required regulatory approval.
 
(b)
 
Subject to obtaining any required regulatory approval, Citigroup shall have the right, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, to redeem the Debentures, in whole but not in part, for cash (i) at any time prior to June 28, 2017 and (ii) on any quarterly distribution date on or after June 28, 2017. Subject to obtaining any required regulatory approval, if, at any time, a Tax Event, an Investment Company Event, a Rating Agency Event, a Regulatory Capital Event or an Additional Amounts Event (each as defined below, and each a "Special Event") shall occur and be continuing, Citigroup shall have the right, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, to redeem the Debentures, in whole but not in part, for cash within 90 days following the occurrence of such Special Event. Following a redemption pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above, and following a redemption pursuant to an Investment Company Event, a Regulatory Capital Event or an Additional Amounts Event, Securities with an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures so redeemed shall be redeemed by the Trust at a redemption price of 1,000 per Security plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon at the date of the redemption, payable in cash (the "Base Redemption Price"). Following a redemption pursuant to a Tax Event or Rating Agency Event, Securities with an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures so redeemed shall be redeemed by the Trust at the Make-Whole Amount (the "Make-Whole Amount Redemption Price" and, together with the Base Redemption Price, the "Redemption Price"); provided, however, that if at the time there is available to Citigroup or the Trust the opportunity to eliminate, within such 90-day period, a Special Event by taking some ministerial action, such as filing a form or making an election or pursuing some other similar reasonable measure that will have no adverse effect on the Trust, Citigroup or the holders of the Securities, then Citigroup or the Trust will pursue such measure in lieu of redemption.

"Investment Company Event" means that the Regular Trustees shall have received an opinion of a nationally recognized independent counsel experienced in practice under the Investment Company Act (an "Investment Company Event Opinion") to the effect that, as a result of the occurrence of a change in law or regulation or a written change in interpretation or application of law or regulation by any legislative body, court, governmental agency or regulatory authority (a "Change in 1940 Act Law"), there is a more than an insubstantial risk that the Trust is or will be considered an Investment Company which is required to be registered under the Investment Company Act, which Change in 1940 Act Law becomes effective on or after the date of the Prospectus.
 
Rating Agency Event means that any nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act that then publishes a rating for Citigroup (a Rating Agency) amends, clarifies or changes the criteria it uses to assign equity credit to securities such as the Debentures, which amendment, clarification or change results in: (i) the shortening of the length of time the Debentures are assigned a particular level of equity credit by that Rating Agency as compared to the length of time they would have been assigned that level of equity credit by that Rating Agency or its predecessor on the issue date of the Securities; or (ii) the lowering of the equity credit (including by assigning equity credit up to a lesser amount) assigned to the Debentures by that Rating Agency as compared to the equity credit assigned by that Rating Agency or its predecessor on the issue date of the Securities.
 
"Regulatory Capital Event" means a determination by Citigroup, based on an opinion of counsel experienced in such matters (who may be an employee of Citigroup or any of its affiliates), that, as a result of (a) any amendment to, clarification of or change (including any announced prospective change) in applicable laws or regulations or official interpretations thereof or policies with respect thereto or (b) any official administrative pronouncement or judicial decision interpreting or applying such laws or regulations, which amendment, clarification, change, pronouncement or decision is announced or is effective after the date of the Prospectus, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Capital Securities will no longer constitute Tier I Capital of Citigroup or any bank holding company of which Citigroup is a subsidiary (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines or policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or its successor as Citigroup's primary federal banking regulator, provided, however that the distribution of the Debentures in connection with the liquidation of the Trust shall not in and of itself constitute a Regulatory Capital Event unless such liquidation shall have occurred in connection with a Tax Event or an Investment Company Event.

(iii)
 
Citigroup receives an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that an act taken by a taxing authority of the United States results in a substantial probability that Citigroup or the Trust will or may be required to pay or procure the payment of the additional amounts.

(e)
 
Redemption or Distribution procedures will be as follows:
 
(i)
 
Notice of any redemption of, or notice of distribution of Debentures in exchange for the Securities (a "Redemption/Distribution Notice") will be given by the Trust by mail to the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee and to each Holder of the Securities to be redeemed or exchanged not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption or exchange thereof which, in the case of a redemption, will be the date fixed for redemption of the Debentures. For purposes of the calculation of the date of redemption or exchange and the dates on which notices are given pursuant to this Section 4(f)(i), a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be deemed to be given on the day such notice is first mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of the Securities. Each Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be addressed to the Holders of the Securities at the address of each such Holder appearing in the books and records of the Trust. No defect in the Redemption/Distribution Notice or in the mailing of either thereof with respect to any Holder shall affect the validity of the redemption or exchange proceedings with respect to any other Holder.
 
(ii)
 
If Securities are to be redeemed and the Trust gives a Redemption/Distribution Notice, which notice may only be issued if the Debentures are redeemed as set out in this Section 4 (which notice will be irrevocable), then (A) while the Capital Securities are in book-entry only form, with respect to the Capital Securities, by 12:00 noon, London time for Capital Securities held through Euroclear or Clearstream, and by 12:00 noon, New York City time for Capital Securities held through DTC, on the redemption date, provided, that the Debenture Issuer has paid to the Paying Agent a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption or maturity of the Debentures, the Paying Agent will deposit irrevocably with DTC, Clearstream or Euroclear or their nominees (or successor Clearing Agency or its nominee) funds sufficient to pay the applicable Redemption Price with respect to the Capital Securities and will give DTC, Clearstream or Euroclear (or any successor Clearing Agency) irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the Redemption Price to the Holders of the Capital Securities, and (B) with respect to Capital Securities issued in definitive form and Common Securities, provided, that the Debenture Issuer has paid the Paying Agent a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption or maturity of the Debentures, the Paying Agent will pay the relevant Redemption Price to the Holders of such Securities by check mailed to the address of the relevant Holder appearing on the books and records of the Trust on the redemption date. If a Redemption/Distribution Notice shall have been given and funds deposited as required, if applicable, then immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such deposit, or on the redemption date, as applicable, distributions will cease to accrue on the Securities so called for redemption and all rights of the Holders of such Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of the Holders of such Securities to receive the Redemption Price, but without interest on such Redemption Price. Neither the Regular Trustees nor the Trust shall be required to register or cause to be registered the transfer of any Securities that have been so called for redemption. If any date fixed for redemption of Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If payment of the Redemption Price in respect of any Securities is improperly withheld or refused and not paid either by the Paying Agent or by the Sponsor as guarantor pursuant to the relevant Securities Guarantee, Distributions on such Securities will continue to accrue from the original redemption date to the actual date of payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.

Voting Rights - Capital Securities
.
 
(a)
 
Except as provided under Sections 5(b) and 7 and as otherwise required by law and the Declaration, the Holders of the Capital Securities will have no voting rights.
 
(b)
 
Subject to the requirements set forth in this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Securities, voting separately as a class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional Trustee, or direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Institutional Trustee under the Declaration, including the right to direct the Institutional Trustee, as holder of the Debentures, to (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee, or exercise any trust or power conferred on the Debenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures, (ii) waive any past Default (as defined in the Indenture) that is waivable under Section 5.6 of the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due and payable or (iv) consent to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the Debentures where such consent shall be required; provided, however, that, where a consent or action under the Indenture would require the consent or act of each holder of each Debenture affected thereby, such consent or action under the Indenture shall not be effective until each Holder of Capital Securities shall have consented to such action or provided such consent. The Institutional Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities. Except with respect to directing the time, method and place of conducting a proceeding for a remedy available to the Institutional Trustee, the Institutional Trustee, as holder of the Debentures, shall not take any of the actions described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above unless the Institutional Trustee has obtained an opinion of a nationally recognized independent tax counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that as a result of such action, the Trust will not fail to be classified as a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes. If the Institutional Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Debentures, any Holder of Capital Securities may directly institute a legal proceeding against the Debenture Issuer to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Debentures without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Institutional Trustee or any other Person or entity. If a Default under the Declaration has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Debenture Issuer to pay interest or principal on the Debentures on the date such interest or principal is otherwise payable (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), then a holder of Capital Securities may also directly institute a proceeding for enforcement of payment to such holder (a "Direct Action") of the principal of or interest on the Debentures having a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital Securities of such holder on or after the respective due date specified in the Debentures without first (i) directing the Institutional Trustee to enforce the terms of the Debentures or (ii) instituting a legal proceeding directly against the Debenture Issuer to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Debentures. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Holders of Capital Securities will not be able to exercise directly any other remedy available to the holders of the Debentures. In connection with such Direct Action, Citigroup will be subrogated to the rights of such Holder of Capital Securities under the Declaration to the extent of any payment made by Citigroup to such holder of Capital Securities in such Direct Action.
 
I-12
 
Any required approval or direction of Holders of Capital Securities may be given at a separate meeting of Holders of Capital Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of Securities in the Trust or pursuant to written consent. The Regular Trustees will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of Capital Securities are entitled to vote, or of any matter upon which action by written consent of such Holders is to be taken, to be mailed to each Holder of record of Capital Securities. Each such notice will include a statement setting forth (i) the date of such meeting or the date by which such action is to be taken, (ii) a description of any resolution proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote or of such matter upon which written consent is sought and (iii) instructions for the delivery of proxies or consents.
 
I-13
 
No vote or consent of the Holders of the Capital Securities will be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel Capital Securities or to distribute the Debentures in accordance with this Declaration and the terms of the Securities.
 
Notwithstanding that Holders of Capital Securities are entitled to vote or consent under any of the circumstances described above, any of the Capital Securities that are owned by the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor shall not be entitled to vote or consent and shall, for purposes of such vote or consent, be treated as if they were not outstanding.

(c)
 
Subject to Section 2.6 of the Declaration and only after the Default with respect to the Capital Securities has been cured, waived, or otherwise eliminated and subject to the requirements of the second to last sentence of this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Common Securities, voting separately as a class, may direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional Trustee, or direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Institutional Trustee under the Declaration, including (i) directing the time, method, place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Debenture Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Debenture Trustee with respect to the Debentures, (ii) waiving any past Default (as defined in the Indenture) that is waivable under Section 5.6 of the Indenture, or (iii) exercising any right to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be due and payable, provided that, where a consent or action under the Indenture would require the consent or act of the Holders of greater than a majority in principal amount of Debentures affected thereby (a "Super Majority"), the Institutional Trustee may only give such consent or take such action at the written direction of the Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the Common Securities which the relevant Super Majority represents of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures outstanding. Pursuant to this Section 6(c), the Institutional Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of the Capital Securities. Other than with respect to directing the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional Trustee or the Debenture Trustee as set forth above, the Institutional Trustee shall not take any action in accordance with the directions of the Holders of the Common Securities under this paragraph unless the Institutional Trustee has obtained an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that for the purposes of United States federal income tax the Trust will not be classified as other than a grantor trust on account of such action. If the Institutional Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Declaration, any Holder of Common Securities may institute a legal proceeding directly against any Person to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Declaration, without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Institutional Trustee or any other Person.
 
I-14
 
Any approval or direction of Holders of Common Securities may be given at a separate meeting of Holders of Common Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of Securities in the Trust or pursuant to written consent. The Regular Trustees will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of Common Securities are entitled to vote, or of any matter upon which action by written consent of such Holders is to be taken, to be mailed to each Holder of record of Common Securities. Each such notice will include a statement setting forth (i) the date of such meeting or the date by which such action is to be taken, (ii) a description of any resolution proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote or of such matter upon which written consent is sought and (iii) instructions for the delivery of proxies or consents.
 
No vote or consent of the Holders of the Common Securities will be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel Common Securities or to distribute the Debentures in accordance with the Declaration and the terms of the Securities.

3
 
 
(c)
 
within 30 days after a series of the Corporations long-term indebtedness for money borrowed (1) becomes Covered Debt or (2) ceases to be Covered Debt, the Corporation will give notice of such occurrence to the holders of such long-term indebtedness for money borrowed in the manner provided for in the indenture, fiscal agency agreement or other contract or instrument under which such long-term indebtedness for money borrowed was issued and, thereafter, publicly announce such occurrence (a) in a Current Report on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act which either describes this Covenant and incorporates this Covenant by reference to a previously filed exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K or includes a copy of this Covenant, and (b) in the Corporations quarterly report on Form 10-Q or the Corporations annual report on Form 10-K, as applicable (or any successor to such forms), that immediately follows the public announcement;

This series of Securities is limited in aggregate principal amount to $ _________(, plus up to an additional $ __________ aggregate principal amount which may be issued upon exercise of the over-allotment option contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement).

Any redemption pursuant to this paragraph will be made upon not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days notice, or with respect to a redemption upon a Special Event, within 90 days following the occurrence of such Special Event, at the Optional Redemption Price. If the Securities are only partially redeemed by the Company pursuant to an Optional Redemption, the Securities will be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by any other method utilized by the Trustee; provided that if, at the time of redemption, the Securities are registered as a Global Security, the Depositary (as defined herein) shall determine the principal amount of such Securities held by each Security Beneficial Owner to be redeemed in accordance with its procedures.
 
19
 
Any redemption of the Securities of this series, in whole or in part, prior to the stated maturity date is subject to the prior concurrence or approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or a successor to either of them, as the Company's primary federal banking regulator (the "Federal Reserve"), or the staff thereof, (i) if such approval is then required in order for securities such as the Securities to qualify as tier 1 capital of a bank holding company under applicable capital adequacy guidelines, regulations, policies, or published interpretations of the Federal Reserve, or (ii) if the Federal Reserve or its staff has informed the Company that it must obtain such approval before redeeming the Securities.
 
In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
 
In case an Event of Default and Acceleration, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of all of the Securities may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series affected at the time outstanding, as defined in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities;
provided, however,
that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Securities of any series, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holders of each Security then outstanding and affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of all of the Holders of the Securities of such series, to waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the registered Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and of any Security issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof (whether by registration of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
20
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Security at the time and place and at the rate and in the money herein prescribed.
 
The Company shall have the right at any time during the term of the Securities and from time to time to extend the interest payment period of such Securities for up to 40 consecutive quarters (an "Extended Interest Payment Period"), at the end of which period the Company shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid (together with interest thereon at the rate specified for the Securities to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law);
provided
, that no such Extended Interest Payment Period shall extend beyond the maturity of the Securities; and
provided further
that during any such Extended Interest Payment Period (a) the Company and any subsidiary of the Company shall not declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto (other than (i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, (ii) purchases of shares of common stock of the Company pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the Extended Interest Payment Period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan, (iii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Company's capital stock for any other class or series of the Company's capital stock, (iv) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged) or (v) the purchase of capital stock of the Company in connection with the distribution thereof), and (b) the Company and any subsidiary of the Company will not make any payment of interest, principal or premium on, or repay, purchase or redeem, any debt securities or guarantees issued by the Company that rank pari passu with or junior to the Securities (other than (i) any payment of current or Deferred Interest on securities that rank pari passu with the Securities that is made pro rata to the amounts due on such securities (including the Securities), provided that any such payments of Deferred Interest are made in accordance with Section 13.5(d) of the Indenture, (ii) any payments of Deferred Interest on securities that rank pari passu with the Securities that, if not made, would give rise to an event of default permitting acceleration of such securities or (iii) any repayment or redemption of a security necessary to avoid a breach of the instrument governing the same). The foregoing, however, will not apply to any stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid. Before the termination of any such Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company may further extend such Extended Interest Payment Period,
provided
that such Extended Interest Payment Period together with all such previous and further extensions thereof shall not exceed 40 consecutive quarters. At the termination of any such Extended Interest Payment Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and any additional amounts then due, the Company may commence a new Extended Interest Payment Period. The Company may pay current interest at any time with cash from any source.
 
21
 
Commencing on the earlier of (i) the Fifth Deferral Anniversary and (ii) the date of any payment of current interest on the Securities during an Extended Interest Payment Period, if any Deferred Interest is outstanding, the Company shall be subject to the Alternative Payment Mechanism, pursuant to which it will continuously use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect sales of shares of its common stock, including treasury shares, in an amount that will generate sufficient net proceeds to enable the Company to pay in full all Deferred Interest on the Securities then outstanding (subject to the APM Maximum Obligation, if applicable, and the Share Cap Amount); provided that the Company shall not be obligated to make offers for or effect sales of its common stock during the occurrence and continuation of a Market Disruption Event or a Supervisory Event. The Company's obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell shares of its common stock to pay all Deferred Interest on the Securities shall resume at such time as no Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event exists or is continuing. The Company may pay Deferred Interest with cash from any source (i) upon and following the Tenth Deferral Anniversary, (ii) upon the Maturity of the Securities, (iii) during the occurrence and continuation of a Supervisory Event, (iv) if the Company has previously sold shares of its common stock up to the Share Cap Amount and the Company has not increased the Share Cap Amount or (v) if an Event of Default and Acceleration shall have occurred and be continuing.
 
The Holder of this Security, by such holders acceptance thereof, agrees that upon any payment or distribution of assets to creditors of the Company upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, reorganization, or in connection with any insolvency, receivership or proceeding under any bankruptcy law with respect to the Company, such Holder shall not have a claim for Deferred Interest, to the extent that the aggregate amount thereof (including Compounded Interest, and Additional Interest thereon) exceeds 25% of the original principal amount of such Security.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, this Security is transferable by the registered Holder hereof on the Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Trustee in the City and State of New York accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Trustee duly executed by the registered Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount and series will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge will be made for any such transfer, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in relation thereto.
 
Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and the Security Registrar may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing hereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and premium, if any, and interest due hereon and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, as such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.
 
[The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $25 and any integral multiple thereof.] [This Global Security is exchangeable for Securities in definitive form only under certain limited circumstances set forth in the Indenture. Securities of this series so issued are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $25 and any integral multiple thereof.] As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations [herein and] therein set forth. Securities of this series [so issued] are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
 
 
This is one of the Securities of the series of Securities described in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
THE BANK OF NEW YORK,
as Trustee
 
By:
Authorized Officer

The aggregate principal amount of Securities which may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited.
 
The Securities may be issued in one or more series. There shall be established in or pursuant to a Board Resolution, and set forth in an Officers' Certificate, or established in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, prior to the issuance of Securities of any series:
 
(1)
 
the title of the Securities of the series (which shall distinguish the Securities of the series from all Securities of any other series);
 
(2)
 
the date or dates on which the principal of the Securities of the series is payable;
 
(3)
 
the rate or rates at which the Securities of the series shall bear interest or the Floating or Adjustable Rate Provision pursuant to which such rates shall be determined, the date or dates from which any such interest shall accrue, the Interest Payment Dates on which any such interest shall be payable and the Regular Record Date for the interest payable on any Interest Payment Date (if such Interest Payment Dates or Regular Record Dates differ from those provided herein);
 
(4)
 
the place or places where the principal of (and any premium, if any) and interest on Securities of the series shall be payable;
 
(5)
 
in addition to the redemption rights provided herein, the period or periods within which (including the Redemption Option Date for the series) and the price or prices at which any Securities of the series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company;
 
(6)
 
if other than denominations of $25 and any integral multiple thereof, the denominations in which Securities of the series shall be issuable;
 
(7)
 
any other defaults applicable with respect to the Securities of the series in addition to those provided in Section 5.7(a) through (f);
 
(8)
 
any other covenant or warranty included for the benefit of Securities of the series in addition to (and not inconsistent with) those included in this Indenture for the benefit of Securities of all series, or any other covenant or warranty included for the benefit of Securities of the series in lieu of any covenant or warranty included in this Indenture for the benefit of Securities of all series, or any provision that any covenant or warranty included in this Indenture for the benefit of Securities of all series shall not be for the benefit of Securities of the series, or any combination of such covenants, warranties or provisions;
 
24
 
(9)
 
the subordination terms of the Securities of the series;
 
(10)
 
the provisions of this Indenture, if any, that shall not apply to the series; and
 
(11)
 
any other terms of the series (which additional terms shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture).
 
All Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or pursuant to such Board Resolution and set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in the Officers' Certificate referred to above or in any such indenture supplemental hereto.
 
If any of the terms of the Securities of a series are established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of the Securities of such series.
 
 
The Securities of each series shall be issuable in registered form without coupons and in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 3.1. In the absence of any such provisions with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $25 and any integral multiple thereof.
 
 
The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman or a Vice Chairman of the Board, its President, a Vice President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Accounting Officer, the Treasurer, any Deputy Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.
 
Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
 
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established in or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 3.1, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive at the time of the initial delivery by the Company of Securities of such series to the Trustee for authentication, and (subject to Section 6.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,
 
25
 
(1)
 
if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 2.1, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
 
(2)
 
if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 3.1, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and
 
(3)
 
that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by or on behalf of the Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement or creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
 
If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
 
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
 
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
 
 
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon receipt of a Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the directors or officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
 
26
 
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for Securities of that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
 
 
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities, or of Securities of a particular series, and of transfers of Securities or of Securities of such series. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
 
Subject to Section 3.11, upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for Securities of that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of like tenor of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount.
 
Subject to Section 3.11, at the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of like tenor of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
 
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
 
27
 
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3.4, 9.6 or 11.7 not involving any transfer.
 
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Security of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of such series selected for redemption under Section 11.3 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
 
 
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
 
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
 
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
 
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
 
28
 
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
 
 
Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
 
Interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
 
(1)
 
The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
 
(2)
 
The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after written notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee in its sole discretion.
 
29
 
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
 
For the purposes of determining the Holders who are entitled to participate in any distribution on the Securities in respect of which a Regular Record Date or a Special Record Date is not otherwise provided for in this Indenture, or for the purpose of any other action (unless provided for pursuant to Section 3.1), the Company may from time to time fix a date, not more than 90 days prior to the date of the payment of distribution or other action, as the case may be, as a record date for the determination of the identity of the Holders of record for such purposes.
 
 
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 3.7) interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
 
All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. Unless otherwise directed by a Company Order, delivery of which must be delivered in a timely manner to prevent such destruction, all cancelled Securities held by the Trustee shall be destroyed by it, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a written request of the Company, shall deliver a certificate of such destruction to the Company.
 
 
(a)
 
Each Security will bear interest at the rate established for the series of Securities of which such Security is a part pursuant to Section 3.1 (the "Coupon Rate
") from and including the original date of issuance of such Security until the principal thereof becomes due and payable, and on any overdue principal and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at the Coupon Rate, compounded quarterly, payable (subject to the provisions of Article Four) quarterly in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year (or in such other periodic installments on such other dates established as payment dates for the series of Securities of which such Security is a part pursuant to Section 3.1) (each, an "Interest Payment Date") commencing on the date established for the series of Securities of which such Security is a part pursuant to Section 3.1, to the Person in whose name such Security or any Predecessor Security is registered, at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest installment, which, in respect of any Securities of which the Institutional Trustee of any Citigroup Trust is the Holder or a Global Security, shall be the close of business on the Business Day next preceding that Interest Payment Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Preferred Securities of a Citigroup Trust are no longer in book-entry only form or, except if the Securities originally issued to such Citigroup Trust are held by the Institutional Trustee of such Citigroup Trust, the Securities of any series are not represented by a Global Security, the Company may select a Regular Record Date for such interest installment on such series of Securities which shall be any date more than 14 days but less than 60 days before an Interest Payment Date.
 
30
 
(b)
 
The amount of interest payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months and will include the first day but exclude the last day of such period. Except as provided in the following sentence, the amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full quarterly period for which interest is computed, will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in each 30-day month. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Securities of any series is not a Business Day, then payment of interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date.
 
(c)
 
If, at any time while the Institutional Trustee of a Citigroup Trust is the Holder of Securities of any series, such Citigroup Trust or such Institutional Trustee is required to pay any taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature (other than withholding taxes) imposed by the United States, or any other taxing authority, then, in any case, the Company will pay as additional interest ("Additional Interest") on the Securities of such series, such additional amounts as shall be required so that the net amounts received and retained by such Citigroup Trust and/or such Institutional Trustee, as the case may be, after paying such taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges will be equal to the amounts Citigroup Trust and/or such Institutional Trustee, as the case may be, would have received had no such taxes, duties, assessments or other government charges been imposed.
 
31
 
 
Except as provided in Section 3.12, the Securities of each series shall be issued in fully registered certificated form without interest coupons. Principal and interest on the Securities issued in certificated form will be payable, the transfer of such Securities will be registrable, and such Securities will be exchangeable, for Securities of the same series bearing identical terms and provisions at the office or agency of the Trustee;
provided
,
however
, that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the Holders of such Securities at such address as shall appear in the Security Register. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Holder of all Securities of any series is the Institutional Trustee of any Citigroup Trust, the payment of the principal of and interest (including Compounded Interest and Additional Interest, if any) on Securities of such series will be made at such place and to such account as may be designated by the Institutional Trustee.
 
 
(a)
 
In connection with Dissolution Event with respect to any Citigroup Trust,
 
(i)
 
the Securities in non book-entry certificated form held by such Citigroup Trust, or its Institutional Trustee, will be presented to the Trustee by the Institutional Trustee of such Citigroup Trust in exchange for a Global Security in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Securities of the series issued to such Citigroup Trust, to be registered in the name of the Depositary, or its nominee, and delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary for crediting to the accounts of its participants pursuant to the instructions of the Regular Trustees of the relevant Citigroup Trust. The Company upon any such presentation shall execute a Global Security in such aggregate principal amount and deliver the same to the Trustee for authentication and delivery in accordance with this Indenture. Payments on any Securities issued as a Global Security will be made to the Depositary; and
 
(ii)
 
if any Preferred Securities of a Citigroup Trust are held in non book-entry certificated form, the Securities in non book-entry certificated form held by such Citigroup Trust, or its Institutional Trustee, may be presented to the Trustee by the Institutional Trustee of such Citigroup Trust and any Preferred Security Certificate which represents Preferred Securities of such Citigroup Trust other than Preferred Securities held by the Depositary or its nominee ("Non Book-Entry Preferred Securities") will be deemed to represent Securities presented to the Trustee by such Institutional Trustee having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Non Book-Entry Preferred Securities until such Preferred Security Certificates are presented to the Security Registrar for transfer or reissuance at which time such Preferred Security Certificates will be cancelled and a Security, registered in the name of the holder of the Preferred Security Certificate or the transferee of the holder of such Preferred Security Certificate, as the case may be, with an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Preferred Security Certificate cancelled, will be executed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee for authentication and delivery in accordance with this Indenture. On issue of such Securities, Securities with an equivalent aggregate principal amount that were presented by the Institutional Trustee to the Trustee will be deemed to have been cancelled.
 
32
 
(b)
 
A Global Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part, only to another nominee of the Depositary, or to a successor Depositary selected or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.
 
(c)
 
If at any time the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for any series of Securities or if at any time the Depositary for such series shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act, or other applicable statute or regulation, and a successor Depositary for such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, the Company will execute, and, subject to this Article III, the Trustee, upon written notice from the Company, will authenticate and deliver the Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security in exchange for such Global Security. In addition, the Company may at any time determine that the Securities of any series shall no longer be represented by a Global Security. In such event the Company will execute, and subject to Section 3.5, the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers Certificate evidencing such determination by the Company, will authenticate and deliver the Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security for such series in exchange for such Global Security. Upon the exchange of the Global Security for such Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, the Global Security shall be cancelled by the Trustee. Such Securities in definitive registered form issued in exchange for the Global Security shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Depositary, for delivery to the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
 
 
 
 
This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when
 
33
 
(1)
 
either
 
(A)
 
all Securities theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 3.6 and (ii) Securities for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 10.3) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
 
(B)
 
all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
 
(i)
 
have become due and payable, or
 
(ii)
 
will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or
 
(iii)
 
are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company,
 
and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;
 
(2)
 
the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and
 
(3)
 
the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with.
 
Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 6.7, the Company's obligation to pay the expenses of any Citigroup Trust under Section 10.6 (except upon the application of subclauses 1(A) or 1(B)(i) above), the obligations of the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 6.14, and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 4.2 and the last paragraph of Section 10.3 shall survive.
 
34
 
 
The following provisions shall apply to the Securities of each series unless specifically otherwise provided in a Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or indenture supplemental hereto provided pursuant to Section 3.1. In addition to discharge of this Indenture pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 4.3, in the case of any series of Securities with respect to which an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, as certified pursuant to subparagraph (a) of Section 4.4 can be determined at the time of making the deposit referred to in such subparagraph (a), the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness on all the Securities of such a series as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 4.4 are satisfied, and the provisions of this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series shall no longer be in effect (except as to (i) rights of registration of transfer and exchange of Securities of such series, (ii) substitution of mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities of such series, (iii) rights of Holders of Securities of such series to receive, solely from the trust fund described in subparagraph (a) of Section 4.4, payments of principal thereof and interest, if any, thereon upon the original stated due dates therefor (but not upon acceleration), (iv) the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder, (v) this Section 4.2, (vi) the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series as beneficiaries hereof with respect to the property so deposited with the Trustee payable to all or any of them and (vii) the Company's obligation to pay the expenses of any Citigroup Trust under Section 10.6) (hereinafter called "Defeasance"), and the Trustee at the cost and expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same.
 
 
In the case of any series of Securities with respect to which an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest, as certified pursuant to subparagraph (a) of Section 4.4 can be determined at the time of making the deposit referred to in such subparagraph (a), (i) the Company shall be released from its obligations under any covenants specified in or pursuant to this Indenture (except as to (A) rights of registration of transfer and exchange of Securities of such series, (B) substitution of mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities of such series, (C) rights of Holders of Securities of such series to receive, from the Company pursuant to Section 10.1, payments of principal thereof and interest, if any, thereon upon the original stated due dates therefor (but not upon acceleration), (D) the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder, (E) the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series as beneficiaries hereof with respect to the property so deposited with the Trustee payable to all or any of them and (F) the Company's obligation to pay the expenses of any Citigroup Trust under Section 10.6), and (ii) the occurrence of any event specified in Sections 5.7(d) (with respect to any of the covenants specified in or pursuant to this Indenture) and 5.7(e) shall be deemed not to be or result in a Default, in each case with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 4.4 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance"), and the Trustee, at the cost and expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same. For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 5.7(d)), whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and the Securities of such series shall be unaffected thereby.
 
35
 
 
The following shall be the conditions to application of either Section 4.2 or 4.3 to the Outstanding Securities:
 
(a)
 
with reference to Section 4.2 or 4.3, the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the Trustee as funds in trust, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of Securities of such series (i) cash in an amount, or (ii) direct obligations of the United States of America, backed by its full faith and credit ("U.S. Government Obligations
"), maturing as to principal and interest, if any, at such times and in such amounts as will insure the availability of cash, or (iii) a combination thereof, in each case sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, the principal of and interest, if any, on all Securities of such series on each date that such principal or interest, if any, is due and payable;
 
(b)
 
in the case of Defeasance under Section 4.2, the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel based on the fact that (x) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (y), since the date hereof, there has been a change in the applicable United States federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of the Securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit, Defeasance and discharge and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times, as would have been the case if such deposit, Defeasance and discharge had not occurred;
 
(c)
 
in the case of Covenant Defeasance under Section 4.3, the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, and such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of the Securities of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times, as would have been the case if such deposit and Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;
 
36
 
(d)
 
such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound; and
 
(e)
 
the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent contemplated by this provision have been complied with.
 
 
Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 10.3, all money and U.S. Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.4 shall be held in trust, and such money and all money from such U.S. Government Obligations shall be applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium, if any) and interest for whose payment such money and U.S. Government Obligations has been deposited with the Trustee.
 
 
The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 4.4 or the principal or interest received in respect of such obligations other than any such tax, fee or other charge that by law is for the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities.
 
 
If the Trustee is unable to apply any money or Government Obligations in accordance with Section 4.4 by reason of any legal preceding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 4.4, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or Government Obligations in accordance with Section 4.4; provided that, if the Company has made any payment of principal or interest on the Securities of any series because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money or Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.
 
37
 
 
 
 
The term "Event of Default and Acceleration" as used in this Indenture with respect to Securities of any series shall mean one of the following described events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and Acceleration and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
 
(a)
 
failure to pay in full interest accrued upon any Security of that series upon the conclusion of a period consisting of 40 consecutive quarters, commencing with the earliest quarter for which interest (including Deferred Interest) has not been paid in full, and continuance of such failure to pay for a period of 30 days;
 
(b)
 
the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case under the Federal bankruptcy code, as now or hereafter constituted, or any other applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee or sequestrator (or similar official) of the Company or for substantially all of its property, or ordering the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or
 
(c)
 
the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case under the Federal bankruptcy code, as now or hereafter constituted, or any other applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or the consent by the Company to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, or the consent by the Company to the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, custodian or sequestrator (or similar official) of the Company or for substantially all of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors.
 
 
If any one or more Event of Default and Acceleration shall occur with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, then, and in each and every such case, during the continuance of any such Event of Default and Acceleration, the Trustee or the Holders of 25% or more in principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of such series then Outstanding, if not then due and payable, to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by such Holders), and upon any such declaration the same shall become and be immediately due and payable, anything in this Indenture or in the Securities of such series contained to the contrary notwithstanding. This provision, however, is subject to the condition that, if at any time after the principal of all the Securities of such series shall have been so declared to be due and payable, all arrears of interest, if any, upon all the Securities of such series (with interest, to the extent that interest thereon shall be legally enforceable, on any overdue installment of interest at the rate borne by the Securities of such series) and all amounts owing the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder under Section 6.7 and all other sums payable under this Indenture (except the principal of the Securities of such series which would not be due and payable were it not for such declaration) shall be paid by the Company, and every other Default under this Indenture, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, shall have been made good to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee or of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding, or provision deemed by the Trustee or by such Holders to be adequate therefor shall have been made, then and in every such case the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series, waive the Event of Default and Acceleration by reason of which the principal of the Securities of such series shall have been so declared to be due and payable and may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences; but no such waiver, rescission or annulment shall extend to or affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Any declaration by the Trustee pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be by written notice to the Company, and any declaration or waiver by the Holders of Securities of any series pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be by written notice to the Company and the Trustee.
 
38
 
 
If the Company shall fail for a period of 30 days to pay any installment of interest on the Securities of any series or shall fail to pay the principal of and premium, if any, on any of the Securities of such series when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity, or by call for redemption by declaration as authorized by this Indenture or otherwise, then, upon demand of the Trustee, the Company will pay to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of Securities of such series then Outstanding the whole amount which then shall have become due and payable on any such Security, with interest on the overdue principal and premium, if any, and (so far as the same may be legally enforceable) on the overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Securities of such series, and all amounts owing the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder under Section 6.7.
 
In case the Company shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceeding at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of such series, and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of such series, wherever situated, in the manner provided by law. Every recovery of judgment in any such action or other proceeding, subject to the payment to the Trustee of all amounts owing the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder under Section 6.7, shall be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of such series of Securities which shall be the subject of such action or proceeding. All rights of action upon or under any of the Securities or this Indenture may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities and without the production of any thereof at any trial or any proceeding relative thereto.
 
39
 
If a Default, of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge, with respect to any series of Securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture, or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
 
 
The Trustee is hereby appointed, and each and every Holder of the Securities, by receiving and holding the same, shall be conclusively deemed to have appointed the Trustee, the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of such Holder, with authority to make or file (whether or not the Company shall be in default in respect of the payment of the principal of, or interest on, any of the Securities), in its own name and as trustee of an express trust or otherwise as it shall deem advisable, in any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or to their respective creditors or property, any and all claims, proofs of claim, proofs of debt, petitions, consents, other papers and documents and amendments of any thereof, as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder and of the Holders of the Securities allowed in any such proceeding and to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim, and to execute and deliver any and all other papers and documents and to do and perform any and all other acts and things, as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to enforce in any such proceeding any of the claims of the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder and of any of such Holders in respect of any of the Securities; and any receiver, assignee, trustee, custodian or debtor in any such proceeding is hereby authorized, and each and every taker or Holder of the Securities, by receiving and holding the same, shall be conclusively deemed to have authorized any such receiver, assignee, trustee, custodian or debtor, to make any such payment or delivery only to or on the order of the Trustee, and to pay to the Trustee any amount due it and any predecessor trustee hereunder under Section 6.7; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize or empower the Trustee to consent to or accept or adopt, on behalf of any Holder of Securities, any plan of reorganization or readjustment of the Company affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize or empower the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of any Securities in any such proceeding.
 
40
 
 
Any moneys collected by the Trustee with respect to a series of Securities under this Article Five shall be applied in the order following, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee for the distribution of such moneys, upon presentation of the several Securities, and stamping thereon the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof, if fully paid:
 
First: To the payment of all amounts due to the Trustee and any predecessor trustee hereunder under Section 6.7.
Second: Subject to Article Fourteen, in case the principal of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall not have become due and be unpaid, to the payment of interest on the Securities of such series, in the order of the maturity of the installments of such interest, with interest (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon the overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by such Securities, such payments to be made ratably to the Persons entitled thereto.
Third: Subject to Article Fourteen, in case the principal of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, to the payment of the whole amount then owing and unpaid upon the Securities of such series for principal and premium, if any, and interest, with interest on the overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Securities of such series, and in case such moneys shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amounts so due and unpaid upon the Securities of such series, then to the payment of such principal and premium, if any, and interest without preference or priority of principal and premium, if any, over interest, or of interest over principal and premium, if any, or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Security of such series over any other Security of such series, ratably to the aggregate of such principal and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest.
 
 
The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee hereunder, or of exercising any trust or power hereby conferred upon the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series; provided, however, that the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee being advised by counsel determines that the action so directed may not lawfully be taken or would be unduly prejudicial to Holders not joining in such direction or would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of the Securities of any series, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such series of Outstanding Securities may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder and its consequences except a default not theretofore cured in the payment of interest or any premium on or the principal of the Securities of such series or in respect of any covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of each series affected thereby;
provided, however
, that if the Securities of such series are held by a Citigroup Trust or a trustee of such trust, such waiver or modification to such waiver shall not be effective until the holders of Trust Securities representing a majority in liquidation preference of Trust Securities of the applicable Citigroup Trust shall have consented to such waiver or modification to such waiver;
provided further
, that if the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security is required, such waiver shall not be effective until each holder of the Trust Securities of the applicable Citigroup Trust shall have consented to such waiver. Upon any such waiver the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any default hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by this Section 5.6, said default shall for all purposes of the Securities of such series and this Indenture cease to exist, and any Default or Event of Default and Acceleration arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing.
 
41
 
 
No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity for the execution of any trust hereunder or for the appointment of a receiver or for any other remedy hereunder, in each case with respect to a Default with respect to such series of Securities, unless such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of the happening of one or more of the Defaults herein specified with respect to such series of Securities, and unless also the Holders of 25% or more in principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding shall have requested the Trustee in writing to take action in respect of the matter complained of, and unless also there shall have been offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee, for 60 days after receipt of such notification, request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding; and such notification, request and offer of indemnity are hereby declared in every such case to be conditions precedent to any such action, suit or proceeding by any Holder of any Security of such series; it being understood and intended that no one or more of the Holders of Securities of such series shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by his or their action to enforce any right hereunder, except in the manner herein provided, and that every action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Indenture or in the Securities of such series shall affect or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of such series to the respective Holders of such Securities at the respective due dates in such Securities stated, or affect or impair the right, which is also absolute and unconditional, of such Holders to institute suit to enforce the payment thereof.
 
42
 
The following events shall be "Defaults" with respect to any series of Securities under this Indenture:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
43
 
 
All parties to this Indenture and the Holders of the Securities agree that the court may in its discretion require, in any action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any action, suit or proceeding against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such action, suit or proceeding of an undertaking to pay the costs of such action, suit or proceeding, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such action, suit or proceeding, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 5.8 shall not apply to any action, suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee, to any action, suit or proceeding instituted by any one or more Holders of Securities holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, or to any action, suit or proceeding instituted by any Holder of Securities for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or the interest on, any of the Securities, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Securities.
 
 
Except as provided in the last sentence of Section 3.6, no remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities of any series is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies, and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of the Securities of any series to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Default shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Default or an acquiescence therein; and every power and remedy given by this Article Five to the Trustee and to the Holders, respectively, may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be. In case the Trustee or any Holder of Securities shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and the proceedings for the enforcement thereof shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of waiver or for any other reason or shall have been adjudicated adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall severally and respectively be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder and thereafter all rights, remedies and powers of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceedings had been instituted, except as to any matters so waived or adjudicated.
 
 
The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no law had been enacted.
 
44
 
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, each Holder of a Security, by such holders acceptance thereof, agrees that upon any payment or distribution of assets to creditors of the Company upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, reorganization, or in connection with any insolvency, receivership or proceeding under any bankruptcy law with respect to the Company, such Holder shall not have a claim for Deferred Interest, to the extent that the aggregate amount thereof (including Compounded Interest and Additional Interest thereon) exceeds 25% of the original principal amount of such Security.
 
 
 
 
(a)
 
Except during the continuance of a Default;
 
(1)
 
the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
 
(2)
 
in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.
 
(b)
 
In case a Default with respect to any series of Securities, of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge, has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.
 
(c)
 
No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct,
except
that
 
(1)
 
this subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of subsection (a) of this Section;
 
45
 
(2)
 
the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
 
(3)
 
the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series determined as provided in Section 5.6, relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series; and
 
(4)
 
no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or indemnity, reasonably satisfactory to it, against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
(d)
 
Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conductor affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
 
 
Within 90 days after the occurrence of any Default hereunder with respect to Securities of any series, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders of Securities of such series, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register, notice of such Default hereunder actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, unless such Default shall have been cured or waived;
provided
that, except in the case of a Default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a Responsible Officer of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders of Securities of such series; and
provided, further
, that in the case of any Default of the character specified in Section 5.7(e) with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof.
 
 
Subject to the provisions of Section 6.1
 
(a)
 
the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;
 
46
 
(b)
 
any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or Company Order, and any resolution of the Board of Directors may be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution;
 
(c)
 
whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, conclusively rely upon an Officers' Certificate;
 
(d)
 
the Trustee may consult with counsel and the written advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;
 
(e)
 
the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity, reasonably satisfactory to it, against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction;
 
(f)
 
the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney; and
 
(g)
 
the Trustee may execute any of the trust or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder.
 
(h)
 
the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any Default or Event of Default and Acceleration with respect to the Securities, unless either (1) a Responsible Officer shall have actual knowledge of such Default or Event of Default and Acceleration or (2) written notice of such Default or Event of Default and Acceleration shall have been given to the Trustee by the Company or by any Holder of the Securities; and
 
(i)
 
the permissive rights of the Trustee enumerated herein shall not be construed as duties.
 
(j)
 
the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder.
 
47
 
(k)
 
the Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers Certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign an Officers Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded.
 
 
The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee or any Authenticating Agent assumes no responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. The Trustee or any Authenticating Agent shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof.
 
 
The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 6.8 and 6.13, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent.

to pay to the Trustee from time to time such reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);
 
(2)
 
except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents, nominees, custodians and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and
 
48
 
(3)
 
to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the trust or trust hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.
 
As security for the performance of the obligations of the Company under this Section, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the benefit of Holders of particular Securities. The obligations of the Company under this Section shall survive the removal or resignation of the Trustee and the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
 
When the Trustee incurs any expenses or renders any services after the occurrence of an Event of Default and Acceleration specified in Section 5.1(b) or Section 5.1(c), such expenses and the compensation for such services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the United States Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the United States Code) or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors.
 
 
The Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 during the period of time provided for therein. In determining whether the Trustee has a conflicting interest as defined in Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 with respect to the Securities of any series, there shall be excluded for purposes of the conflicting interest provisions of such Section 310(b) the Securities of every other series issued under this Indenture. Nothing herein shall prevent the Trustee from filing with the Commission the application referred to in the second to last paragraph of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
 
 
There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervision or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.
 
49
 
 
(a)
 
No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11.
 
(b)
 
The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 6.11 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
 
(c)
 
The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.
 
(d)
 
If at any time:
 
(1)
 
the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 6.8(a) after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or
 
(2)
 
the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 6.9 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or
 
(3)
 
the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then, in any such case, (i) the Company, by a Board Resolution, may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (ii) subject to Section 5.8, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.
 
(e)
 
If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 6.11, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 6.11, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
 
50
 
(f)
 
The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series by mailing written notice of such event by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Securities of such series as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.
 
 
(a)
 
In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.
 
(b)
 
In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to the Securities of all series for which it is the Trustee hereunder, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any mist or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
 
51
 
(c)
 
Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.
 
(d)
 
No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
 
(e)
 
The Trustee shall not be liable for the acts or omissions to act of any successor Trustee.
 
 
Any corporation or association into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or association resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation or association to which all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee may be sold or otherwise transferred, shall be the successor trustee hereunder without any further act. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.
 
 
The Trustee shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act Section 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in the Trust Indenture Act Section 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to the Trust Indenture Act Section 311(a) to the extent indicated therein.
 
52
 
 
At any time when any of the Securities remain Outstanding the Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to Section 3.6, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
 
Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
 
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give notice of such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
 
53
 
The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.
 
If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:
 
"This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
54
 
 
 
 
The Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee

(b)
 
at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, within 30 days after the receipt by the Company of any such request, a list of similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such list is furnished;
 
provided

(c)
 
A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to such Holders, be filed by the Trustee with each securities exchange upon which any such Securities are listed, with the Commission and with the Company. The Company will notify the Trustee when any such Securities are listed on any securities exchange.
 
 
The Company shall:

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such reports shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).
 
 
 
 
The Company shall not consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, unless:

If the Company is involved in a business combination where, immediately after the consummation of such business combination, more than 50% of the surviving entitys voting stock is owned by the shareholders of the other party to the business combination, then:

provided, further
, that if the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security is required, such supplemental indenture shall not be effective until each holder of the Trust Securities of the applicable Citigroup Trust shall have consented to such supplemental indenture.
 
60
 
A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.
 
It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.
 
 
In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the documents required by Section 1.2, and (subject to Section 6.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.

Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series.
 
61
 
 
 
The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of the Securities of such series and this Indenture, and will duly comply with all other terms, agreements and conditions contained in, or made in the Indenture for the benefit of, the Securities of such series.
 
 
The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
 
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations;
provided
that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
 
 
If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
 
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
 
62
 
The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
 
(1)
 
hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on Securities of that series in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
 
(2)
 
give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities of that series; and
 
(3)
 
at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent.
 
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
 
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for three years after such principal (and premium, if any) or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease;
provided
that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.
 
63
 
 
The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, an Officers' Certificate stating whether or not to the best knowledge of the signers thereof the Company is in default in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of Sections 10.1 to 10.3, inclusive, and if the Company shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which they may have knowledge.
 
 
For so long as any Trust Securities of a Citigroup Trust remain outstanding, the Company will (i) maintain 100% direct or indirect ownership of the Common Securities of such Citigroup Trust;
provided, however
, that any permitted successor of the Company hereunder may succeed to the Company's ownership of such Common Securities, (ii) not voluntarily dissolve, wind up or terminate such Citigroup Trust, except in connection with a distribution of Securities upon a Special Event, and in connection with certain mergers, consolidations or amalgamations permitted by the Declaration of the applicable Citigroup Trust, (iii) timely perform its duties as Sponsor of the applicable Citigroup Trust, (iv) use its reasonable efforts to cause such Citigroup Trust to (a) remain a business trust, except in connection with a distribution of Securities to the holders of Trust Securities as provided in the Declaration of such Citigroup Trust, the redemption of all of the Trust Securities and in connection with certain mergers, consolidations or amalgamations permitted by the Declaration of such Citigroup Trust, and (b) otherwise continue to be classified as a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes and (v) not knowingly take any action that would cause such Citigroup Trust to not be classified as a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes.
 
 
(a)
 
In connection with the offering, sale and issuance of each series of Securities to the Institutional Trustee of a Citigroup Trust and in connection with the sale of Trust Securities by such Citigroup Trust, the Company, in its capacity as borrower with respect to such Securities, shall:
 
(i)
 
pay all costs and expenses relating to the offering, sale and issuance of such Securities, including commissions to the underwriters payable pursuant to the applicable Underwriting Agreement and compensation of the Trustee under this Indenture in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.7;

be primarily liable for any indemnification obligations arising with respect to the Declaration of such Citigroup Trust;
 
(iv)
 
pay any and all taxes (other than United States withholding taxes in respect of amounts paid on the Securities held by such Citigroup Trust) and all liabilities, costs and expenses with respect to such taxes of such Citigroup Trust.
 
(b)
 
Upon termination of this Indenture or any series of Securities or the removal or resignation of the Trustee pursuant to Section 6.10, the Company shall pay to the Trustee all amounts accrued and owing to the Trustee to the date of such termination, removal or resignation. Upon termination of the Declaration of any Citigroup Trust or the removal or resignation of the Delaware Trustee or the Institutional Trustee, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 5.6 of the Declaration of such Citigroup Trust, the Company shall pay to such Delaware Trustee or such Institutional Trustee, as the case may be, all amounts accrued and owing to such Delaware Trustee or such Institutional Trustee, as the case may be, to the date of such termination, removal or resignation.
 
 
If Securities of any series are to be issued as a Global Security in connection with the distribution of such Securities to the holders of the Preferred Securities of a Citigroup Trust upon a Dissolution Event with respect to such Citigroup Trust, the Company will use its best efforts to list such series of Securities on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or on such other securities exchange as the Preferred Securities of such Citigroup Trust are then listed. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any Securities that will be listed on any securities exchange.
 
 
Any Securities issued under this Indenture shall (x) be issued with the concurrence or approval of the Federal Reserve or its staff or (y) qualify at the time of issuance for tier 1 capital treatment (irrespective of any limits on the amount of the Companys tier 1 capital) under applicable capital adequacy guidelines, regulations, policies or published interpretations of the Federal Reserve.
 
65
 
 
 
Securities of each series are redeemable before their respective Stated Maturities in accordance with their respective terms and (except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article. Any redemption of any series of Securities, in whole or in part, prior to their respective Stated Maturities shall be subject to receipt by the Company of the prior concurrence or approval of the Federal Reserve or its staff, (i) if such concurrence or approval is then required in order for securities such as the Securities to qualify as tier 1 capital under applicable capital adequacy guidelines, regulations, policies, published interpretations, or concurrence or approval of the Federal Reserve or its staff, or (ii) if the Federal Reserve or its staff has informed the Company that it must obtain such approval before redeeming the Securities.
 
 
(a)
 
Subject to the provisions of Section 11.2(b) and to the other provisions of this Article XI, except as otherwise may be specified in this Indenture or, with respect to any series of Securities, as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 3.1 for the Securities of such series, the Company shall have the right to redeem any series of Securities, in whole or in part, from time to time, on or after the Redemption Option Date for such series at the Redemption Price. The election of the Company to redeem any Securities redeemable at the election of the Company shall be evidenced by a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of less than all the Securities of any series, the Company shall, at least 40 days (unless a shorter period is acceptable to the Trustee), but not more than 60 days, prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Company, notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such restriction.
 
(b)
 
If a partial redemption of any series of Securities would result in the delisting of the Preferred Securities of the Citigroup Trust that purchased such Securities from any national securities exchange or other organization on which the Preferred Securities of such Citigroup Trust are then listed, the Company shall not be permitted to effect such partial redemption and may only redeem such series of Securities in whole.
 
 
If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series;
provided
, that, if at the time of redemption such Securities are registered as a Global Security, the Depositary shall determine, in accordance with its procedures, the principal amount of such Securities held by each Security Beneficial Owner to be redeemed.
 
66
 
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in case of any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
 
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.
 
 
Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security Register.
 
All notices of redemption shall state:
 
(1)
 
the Redemption Date,
 
(2)
 
the Redemption Price,
 
(3)
 
if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities of such series to be redeemed,
 
(4)
 
that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date, and
 
(5)
 
the place or places where such Securities are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price.
 
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company.
 
67
 
 
Prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 10.3) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date.
 
 
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date;
provided
that installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 3.7.
 
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal (and premium, if any) shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.
 
The Redemption Price shall be paid prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of such redemption or such earlier time as the Company determines,
provided
that the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay the Redemption Price by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date such Redemption Price is to be paid.
 
 
Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment for Securities of that series (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of like tenor and of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.
 
68
 
 
If a Tax Event with respect to any Citigroup Trust has occurred and is continuing and:
 
(a)
 
the Company has received a Redemption Tax Opinion with respect to such Citigroup Trust; or
 
(b)
 
after receiving a Tax Event Opinion, the Regular Trustees of such Citigroup Trust shall have been informed by tax counsel rendering the Tax Event Opinion that a No Recognition Opinion cannot be delivered to such Citigroup Trust,
 
then, notwithstanding Section 11.2(a) but subject to Section 11.2(b) and Section 11.1, the Company shall have the right upon not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days notice to the Holders of Securities of the series issued to such Citigroup Trust, or to its Institutional Trustee, to redeem such Securities, in whole or in part, for cash within 90 days following the occurrence of such Tax Event at the Redemption Price,
provided
that if at the time there is available to the Company or such Citigroup Trust the opportunity to eliminate, within such 90-day period, the Tax Event by taking some ministerial action ("Ministerial Action"), such as filing a form or making an election, or pursuing some other similar reasonable measure which has no adverse effect on the Company, the Trust or the holders of the Trust Securities of such Citigroup Trust, the Company or such Citigroup Trust shall pursue such Ministerial Action in lieu of redemption, and,
provided further
that the Company shall have no right to redeem such Securities while the Company or such Citigroup Trust is pursuing any Ministerial Action pursuant to its obligations under the Declaration of such Citigroup Trust.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time during the term of the Securities of any series, to defer payments of interest by extending the interest payment period of all Securities of such series for a period not exceeding 40 consecutive quarters (the "Extended Interest Payment Period"), during which Extended Interest Payment Period no interest shall be due and payable on Securities of such series;
provided
that no Extended Interest Payment Period may extend beyond the Maturity of such Securities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, interest, the payment of which has been deferred because of the extension of the interest payment period pursuant to this Section 13.1, will bear interest thereon at the Coupon Rate compounded quarterly for each quarter of the Extended Interest Payment Period ("Compounded Interest"). At the end of any Extended Interest Payment Period with respect to any series of Securities, the Company shall pay all interest accrued and unpaid on such Securities, including any Additional Interest and Compounded Interest (together, "Deferred Interest") that shall be payable to the Holders of Securities of such Series in whose names such Securities are registered in the Security Register on the first record date after the end of such Extended Interest Payment Period. Before the termination of any Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company may further extend such period;
provided
that such period, together with all such further extensions thereof, shall not exceed 40 consecutive quarters; and
provided further
that no prepayment of interest during an Extended Interest Payment Period shall allow the Company to extend such Extended Interest Payment Period beyond 40 consecutive quarters. Upon the termination of any Extended Interest Payment Period with respect to any series of Securities and upon the payment of all Deferred Interest then due, the Company may commence a new Extended Interest Payment Period with respect to such series of Securities, subject to the foregoing requirements. No interest on a series of Securities shall be due and payable during an Extended Interest Payment Period with respect thereto, except at the end thereof,
provided
the Company may prepay at any time all or any portion of the interest accrued during any Extended Interest Payment Period.
 
69
 
 
(a)
 
If the Institutional Trustee of a Citigroup Trust is the only Holder of Securities of a series at the time the Company selects an Extended Interest Payment Period with respect thereto, the Company shall give written notice to the Regular Trustees and the Institutional Trustee of such Citigroup Trust and to the Trustee of its selection of such Extended Interest Payment Period at least one Business Day before the earlier of (i) the next succeeding date on which Distributions on the Trust Securities issued by such Citigroup Trust are payable, or (ii) the date such Citigroup Trust is required to give notice of the record date, or the date such Distributions would be payable if not for such Extended Interest Payment Period, to the New York Stock Exchange or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to holders of the Preferred Securities issued by such Citigroup Trust, but in any event at least one Business Day before such record date.
 
(b)
 
If the Institutional Trustee of a Citigroup Trust is not the only Holder of Securities of a series at the time the Company selects an Extended Interest Payment Period with respect thereto, the Company shall give written notice to the Holders of Securities of such series and the Trustee of its selection of such Extended Interest Payment Period at least 10 Business Days before the earlier of (i) the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, or (ii) the date the Company is required to give notice of the record or payment date of such interest payment to the New York Stock Exchange or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to Holders of Securities of such series.
 
(c)
 
The quarter in which any notice is given pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section 13.2 shall be counted as one of the 40 quarters permitted in the maximum Extended Interest Payment Period with respect to any series of Securities permitted under Section 1.3.
 
70
 
(d)
 
Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Indenture, the Company shall be required to give notice to any person of its selection of an Extended Interest Payment Period no more than 15 Business Days and no less than 5 Business Days before the next succeeding Interest Payment Date of the affected Securities.
 
 
If with respect to any series of Securities (i) the Company shall exercise its right to defer payments of interest thereon as provided in Section 13.1 or (ii) there shall have occurred any Default, then (a) the Company and any subsidiary of the Company shall not declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto (other than (i) purchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of employees, officers, directors or consultants, (ii) purchases of shares of common stock of the Company pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy stock existing prior to the commencement of the extension period, including under a contractually binding stock repurchase plan, (iii) as a result of an exchange or conversion of any class or series of the Company's capital stock for any other class or series of the Company's capital stock, (iv) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged, or (v) purchase of the Company's capital stock in connection with the distribution thereof); and (b) the Company and any subsidiary of the Company will not make any payment of interest, principal or premium on, or repay, purchase or redeem, any debt securities or guarantees issued by the Company that rank pari passu with or junior to the Securities (other than (i) any payment of current or Deferred Interest on securities that rank pari passu with the Securities that is made pro rata to the amounts due on such securities (including the Securities), provided that any such payments of Deferred Interest are made in accordance with Section 13.5(d), (ii) any payments of Deferred Interest on securities that rank pari passu with the Securities that, if not made, would give rise to an event of default permitting acceleration of such securities or (iii) any repayment or redemption of a security necessary to avoid a breach of the instrument governing the same),
provided, however
, that the Company may declare and pay a stock dividend where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid. If any Extended Interest Payment Period lasts longer than one year, unless required to do so by the Federal Reserve and subject to the exceptions listed in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 13.3, the Company will not, and will not permit any subsidiary to purchase any of its common stock for a one-year period following the payment of all Deferred Interest with the New Equity Amount.
 
71
 
 
During an Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company may not pay Deferred Interest on the Securities on any date in an amount that exceeds the New Equity Amount for such date;
provided
,
however
, that (i) upon the Maturity of the Securities, (ii) during the occurrence and continuation of a Supervisory Event or (iii) if an Event of Default and Acceleration shall have occurred and be continuing, the provisions of this Section 13.4 shall not apply and the Company may pay Deferred Interest with cash from any source. Nothing in this Indenture will prevent the Company from paying current interest on the Securities at any time using cash from any source.
 
 
(a)
 
Commencing on the earlier of (i) the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, if on such date the related Extended Interest Payment Period has not ended, and (ii) the date of any payment of current interest on the Securities during an Extended Interest Payment Period, if any Deferred Interest is outstanding, the Company shall be subject to the "Alternative Payment Mechanism," pursuant to which it will continuously use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect sales of shares of its common stock, including treasury shares, in an amount that will generate sufficient net proceeds to enable the Company to pay in full all Deferred Interest on the Securities then outstanding; provided that the Company shall not be obligated to make offers for or effect sales of its common stock during the occurrence and continuation of a Market Disruption Event or a Supervisory Event and will be permitted to pay Deferred Interest using cash from any source upon the occurrence of a Supervisory Event. The Company's obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell shares of its common stock to pay all Deferred Interest on the Securities shall resume at such time as no Market Disruption Event or Supervisory Event exists or is continuing.
 
(b)
 
As used in this Section 13.5, the term commercially reasonable efforts means commercially reasonable efforts on the part of the Company to complete the sale of shares of its common stock, including treasury shares, to third parties that are not subsidiaries of the Company. The Company will not be considered to have used its commercially reasonable efforts to effect a sale of stock if it determines not to pursue or complete such sale solely due to pricing or dilution considerations.
 
(c)
 
The Company is not permitted to sell shares of common stock in excess of a number of shares of common stock to be specified pursuant to a Board Resolution, and set forth in an Officers Certificate for each series of Securities (in each case, the "Share Cap Amount"), for the purpose of satisfying Section 13.5(a) or otherwise paying Deferred Interest on the Securities of the relevant series then outstanding. If the issued and outstanding shares of common stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction, then each affected Share Cap Amount shall be correspondingly adjusted. The Company shall increase a Share Cap Amount (including through the increase of its authorized share capital, if necessary) to an amount that would allow the Company to raise sufficient proceeds to satisfy its obligations to pay Deferred Interest in full at the end of the first year of an Extended Interest Payment Period (and on each subsequent anniversary of the end of the first year of an Extended Interest Payment Period to the extent that an Extended Interest Payment Period would last more than one year), if a then-current Share Cap Amount would not allow the Company to raise sufficient proceeds to satisfy its obligations to pay Deferred Interest (including Compounded Interest to that date) assuming a price per share equal to the average trading price of the Companys common shares over the ten-trading-day period preceding such date;
provided
that the Company will not be obligated to increase a Share Cap Amount above the maximum number of shares specified in the relevant Officers Certificate. Until the Tenth Deferral Anniversary, a Default will occur if the Company does not increase the relevant Share Cap Amount to an amount that is greater than the minimum number of shares specified in the relevant Officers Certificate when required to do so as described above; provided that no Default will occur if the Company has increased the relevant Share Cap Amount to the maximum number of shares specified in the relevant Officers Certificate.
 
72
 
(d)
 
Following the earlier of (i) the Fifth Deferral Anniversary and (ii) the date of any payment of current interest during an Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company shall apply the net proceeds received by it from sales of shares of its common stock, including sales of treasury shares, to the payment of all amounts owing in respect of Deferred Interest, with net proceeds to be paid promptly after receipt until all amounts owing in respect of Deferred Interest have been paid in full. In the event that net proceeds received by the Company from one or more sales of shares of its common stock following such Fifth Deferral Anniversary are not sufficient to satisfy the full amount of Deferred Interest, such net proceeds will be paid to the holders of the Securities in chronological order; provided, that if the Company has outstanding at such time any debt securities ranking pari passu with the Securities under the terms of which the Company is obligated to sell shares of its common stock and apply the net proceeds to payment of deferred interest on such pari passu securities and the Company at such time is required to apply such proceeds to pay deferred interest on such pari passu securities, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Company from such sales and available for payment of such deferred interest shall be applied on a pro rata basis to the amounts due on each series of such securities (including the Securities) up to any APM Maximum Obligation, Share Cap Amount or other similar limit then applicable to such series. Notwithstanding the above, the Company shall not be obligated to sell common stock or to apply such net proceeds or any portion thereof to the payment of Deferred Interest during the occurrence and continuation of Market Disruption Event or a Supervisory Event.
 
(e)
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, under no circumstances will the Company be obligated to sell shares of Qualified Warrants or to apply the proceeds of any such sale to pay Deferred Interest on the Securities.
 
(f)
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, the Company will not be obligated to issue common stock prior to the Fifth Deferral Anniversary if the gross proceeds of any issuance of common stock and Qualified Warrants applied to pay Deferred Interest on the Securities pursuant to this Section 13.5, together with the gross proceeds of all prior issuances of common stock and Qualified Warrants applied since the commencement of the Extended Interest Payment Period, would exceed an amount equal to 2% of the product of (1) the average of the Current Stock Market Prices of the Companys common stock on the 10 consecutive trading days ending on the fourth trading day immediately preceding the date of issuance by the Company of common stock applied to pay Deferred Interest on the Securities pursuant to Section 13.5 and (2) the total number of issued and outstanding shares of the Companys common stock as of the date of the Companys publicly available consolidated financial statements (the APM Maximum Obligation). Once the Company reaches the APM Maximum Obligation for an Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company will not be obligated to issue more common stock or Qualified Warrants pursuant to this Section 13.5 prior to the Fifth Deferral Anniversary even if the Current Stock Market Price of the Company's common stock or the number of outstanding shares of its common stock subsequently increase. The APM Maximum Obligation will cease to apply following the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, at which point the Company must repay any Deferred Interest, regardless of the time at which it was deferred, using proceeds from sales of the Company's common stock, including treasury shares, subject to any Market Disruption Event, Supervisory Event, and the Share Cap Amount. If the APM Maximum Obligation has been reached during an Extended Interest Payment Period and the Company subsequently repays all Deferred Interest, the APM Maximum Obligation will cease to apply at the termination of such Extended Interest Payment Period and will not apply again unless and until the Company starts a new Extended Interest Payment Period.
 
73
 
 
Upon and after the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, if a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall give, as promptly as possible after the Company becomes aware of such occurrence, a written notice (a "Market Disruption Event Notice") to the Trustee, stating the date on which such Market Disruption Event has occurred, the nature thereof and what action it will take in connection therewith.
 
 
Upon and after the Fifth Deferral Anniversary, if a Supervisory Event has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall give, as promptly as possible after the Company becomes aware of such occurrence, a written notice (a "Supervisory Event Notice") to the Trustee stating that a Supervisory Event has commenced and the actions it will take in connection therewith. No later than five (5) Business Days following termination of a Supervisory Event, the Company shall give a written notice to the Trustee stating the date on which such Supervisory Event terminated.
 
 
The Company shall give written notice to the Federal Reserve:
 
(a)
 
No later than five (5) Business Days following commencement of an Extended Interest Payment Period; and
 
74
 
(b)
 
Upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Fifth Deferral Anniversary of such Extended Interest Payment Period or (ii) the payment of current interest during an Extended Interest Payment Period.
 
 
(a)
 
At least 25 Business Days in advance of the relevant payment date (or such longer period as may be required by the Federal Reserve or by other supervisory action) the Company shall give written notice to the Federal Reserve of its intent both (1) to sell shares of common stock or, at the Company's sole discretion, Qualified Warrants and (2) to apply the net proceeds from such sale to pay Deferred Interest, and shall only take any such actions if the Federal Reserve does not disapprove of any such actions within ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period as may be required by Federal Reserve order or by other supervisory action) after the Company gives such notice to the Federal Reserve or has withdrawn any prior disapproval.
 
 
 
 
The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of Securities issued hereunder by such Holder's acceptance thereof likewise covenants and agrees, that all Securities shall be issued subject to the provisions of this Article Fourteen; and each Holder of a Security, whether upon original issue or upon transfer or assignment thereof, accepts and agrees to be bound by such provisions.
 
The payment by the Company of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all Securities issued hereunder shall, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth, be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, whether outstanding at the date of this Indenture or thereafter incurred.
 
No provision of this Article Fourteen shall prevent the occurrence of any Default hereunder.
 
 
In the event and during the continuation of any default by the Company in the payment of principal, premium, interest or any other payment due on any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be, or in the event that the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be, has been accelerated because of a default, then, in either case, no payment shall be made by the Company with respect to the principal (including redemption payments) of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Securities or to acquire any of the Securities.
 
75
 
In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment shall be received by the Trustee, by any Holder or by any Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, money for any such payment is segregated and held in trust) when such payment is prohibited by the preceding paragraph of this Section 14.2, before all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full, or provision is made for such payment in money in accordance with its terms, such payment shall be held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or their respective representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, ratably according to the aggregate amount remaining unpaid on account of the principal, premium, interest or any other payment due on the Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be, remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Senior Indebtedness in full in money in accordance with its terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the benefit of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, but only to the extent that the holders of the Senior Indebtedness (or their representative or representatives or a trustee) notify the Trustee in writing within 90 days of such payment of the amounts then due and owing on the Senior Indebtedness and only the amounts specified in such notice to the Trustee shall be paid to the holders of Senior Indebtedness.
 
 
Upon any payment by the Company or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors upon any dissolution or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings, all amounts due upon all Senior Indebtedness of the Company shall first be paid in full, or payment thereof provided for in money in accordance with its terms, before any payment is made by the Company on account of the principal (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities; and upon any such dissolution or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization, any payment by the Company, or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled to receive, except for the provisions of this Article Fourteen, shall be paid by the Company or by any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, or by the Holders of the Securities or by the Trustee under this Indenture if received by them or it, directly to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company (
pro
 
rata
to such holders on the basis of the respective amounts of Senior Indebtedness held by such holders, as calculated by the Company) or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, to the extent necessary to pay such Senior Indebtedness in full, in money or money's worth, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, before any payment or distribution is made to the Holders of Securities or to the Trustee.
 
76
 
In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, prohibited by the foregoing, shall be received by the Trustee, by any Holder or by any Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, money for any such payment is segregated and held in trust) before all Senior Indebtedness of the Company is paid in full, or provision is made for such payment in money in accordance with its terms, such payment or distribution shall be held in trust for the benefit of and shall be paid over or delivered to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, ratably according to the aggregate amount remaining unpaid on account of the principal, premium, interest or any other payment due on the Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, as calculated by the Company, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be, remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such Senior Indebtedness in full in money in accordance with its terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the benefit of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.
 
For purposes of this Article Fourteen, the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in this Article Fourteen with respect to the Securities to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be, that may at the time be outstanding, provided that (i) such Senior Indebtedness is assumed by the new corporation, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness are not, without the consent of such holders, altered by such reorganization or readjustment. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company into, another corporation or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the conveyance or transfer of its property as an entirety, or substantially as an entirety, to another corporation upon the terms and conditions provided for in Article VIII shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section 14.3 if such other corporation shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions stated in Article VIII. Nothing in Section 14.2 or in this Section 14.3 shall apply to-claims of, or payments to the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 6.7.
 
 
Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, the rights of the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of such indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company, as the case may be, applicable to such Senior Indebtedness until the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities shall be paid in full; and, for the purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article Fourteen, and no payment over pursuant to the provisions of this Article Fourteen to or for the benefit of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness by Holders of the Securities or the Trustee, shall, as between the Company, its creditors other than Holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and the holders of the Securities, be deemed to be a payment by the Company to or on account of such Senior Indebtedness. It is understood that the provisions of this Article Fourteen are and are intended solely for the purposes of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities, on the one hand, and the holders of such Senior Indebtedness on the other hand.
 
77
 
Nothing contained in this Article Fourteen or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities is intended to or shall impair, as between the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, and the Holders of the Securities, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders of the Securities the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities and creditors of the Company, as the case may be, other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Security from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under the Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article Fourteen of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company, as the case may be, received upon the exercise of any such remedy.
 
Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article Fourteen, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, and the Holders of the Securities shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending, or a certificate of the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidation trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of the Securities, for the purposes of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article Fourteen.
 
 
Each Holder of Securities by such Holder's acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on such Holder's behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in this Article Fourteen and appoints the Trustee such Holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
 
78
 
 
The Company shall give prompt written notice to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities pursuant to the provisions of this Article Fourteen. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article Fourteen or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities pursuant to the provisions of this Article Fourteen, unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or a holder or holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or from any trustee therefor; and before the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1 shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts exist;
provided, however
, that if the Trustee shall not have received the notice provided for in this Section 14.6 at least three Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any money may become payable for any purpose (including, without limitation, the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security), then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive such money and to apply the same to the purposes for which they were received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it within three Business Days prior to such date.
 
The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as the case may be (or a trustee on behalf of such holder), to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of such Senior Indebtedness or a trustee on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of such Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article Fourteen, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article Fourteen, and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.
 
 
The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article Fourteen in respect of any Senior Indebtedness at any time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.
 
With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article Fourteen, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness and, subject to the provisions of Section 6.1, the Trustee shall not be liable to any holder of such Senior Indebtedness if it shall pay over or deliver to Holders of Securities, the Company or any other Person money or assets to which any holder of such Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Fourteen or otherwise.
 
79
 
 
No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness of the Company to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company, as the case may be, or by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company, as the case may be, with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof that any such holder may have or otherwise be charged with.
 
Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the holders of Senior Indebtedness of the Company may, at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities, without incurring responsibility to the Holders of the Securities and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article Fourteen or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Securities to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, such Senior Indebtedness, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner such Senior Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which such Senior Indebtedness is outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing such Senior Indebtedness; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection of such Senior Indebtedness; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company, as the case may be, and any other Person.
 
 
Nothing in this Article Fourteen shall apply to amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to Section 6.7 of this Indenture.
 
 
Except as specifically provided for in this Article 14, no holder of Senior Indebtedness shall have any right to enforce any of the covenants in this Indenture, including but not limited to those contained in Sections 5.11, 13.4, 13.5, 13.6, 13.7 and 13.8
 
80
 
 
The Company acknowledges that, with respect to any Securities held by a Citigroup Trust or a trustee of such Trust, if the Institutional Trustee of such Citigroup Trust fails to enforce its rights under this Indenture as the Holder of the series of Securities held as the assets of such Citigroup Trust, any holder of Preferred Securities of such Citigroup Trust may institute legal proceedings directly against the Company to enforce such Institutional Trustee's rights under this Indenture without first instituting any legal proceedings against such Institutional Trustee or any other person or entity.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Default has occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the Company to pay interest or principal on the applicable series of Securities on the date such interest or principal is otherwise payable (or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), the Company acknowledges that a holder of Trust Securities issued by the Citigroup Trust which is, or the Institutional Trustee of which is, the Holder of such Securities may directly institute a proceeding for enforcement of payment to such holder of the principal of or interest on the applicable series of Securities having a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Trust Securities of such holder (a "Direct Action") on or after the respective due date specified of such holder on or after the respective due date specified in the applicable series of Securities. Notwithstanding any payments made to such holder of Trust Securities by the Company in connection with a Direct Action, the Company shall remain obligated to pay the principal of or interest on the series of Securities held by a Citigroup Trust or the Institutional Trustee of a Citigroup Trust, and the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the holder of such Trust Securities to the extent of any payments made by the Company to such holder in any Direct Action.
 
 
In case any provision in this Indenture or in any series of Securities shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
 
 
This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.

Re:
 
Registration Statement on Form S-3
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special counsel to Citigroup Capital XVIII, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"), and Citigroup Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the public offering by the Trust of up to 500,000 of its 6.829% fixed rate/floating rate enhanced trust preferred securities (liquidation amount 1,000 per capital security) (the "Capital Securities") and related issuance by the Company of up to 500,050,000 aggregate principal amount of 6.829% fixed rate/floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures due June 28, 2067 (the "Junior Subordinated Debt Securities ").
 
This opinion is being furnished to you in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(8) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
In connection with our opinion, we have examined and relied on originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the Registration Statement, the final prospectus dated June 22, 2007 (the "Prospectus") and such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein. We have also relied upon statements and representations made to us by representatives of the Company and the Trust and have assumed that such statements and the facts set forth in such representations are true, correct and complete without regard to any qualification as to knowledge or belief. For purposes of this opinion, we have assumed the validity and the initial and continuing accuracy of the documents, certificates, records, statements and representations referred to above. We have also assumed that the transactions related to the offering of the Capital Securities will be consummated in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus.

In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic, electronic or facsimile copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. In making our examination of documents executed, or to be executed, by the parties indicated therein, we have assumed that each party has, or will have, the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder, and we have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by each party indicated in the documents and that such documents constitute, or will constitute, valid and binding obligations of each party.
 
In rendering our opinion, we have considered the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury Department regulations promulgated thereunder, pertinent judicial authorities, interpretive rulings of the Internal Revenue Service and such other authorities as we have considered relevant. It should be noted that statutes, regulations, judicial decisions and administrative interpretations are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. There can be no assurance, moreover, that the opinion expressed herein will be accepted by the Internal Revenue Service or, if challenged, by a court of law. A change in the authorities or the accuracy or completeness of any of the information, documents, certificates, records, statements, representations or assumptions on which our opinion is based could affect our conclusions.
 
Based upon the foregoing and in reliance thereon, and subject to the qualifications, exceptions, assumptions and limitations contained herein or in the Prospectus, we are of the opinion that, under current United States federal income tax law:

Except as set forth above, we express no opinion to any party as to any tax consequences, whether federal, state, local or foreign, of the Capital Securities or of any transaction related thereto. This opinion is expressed as of the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to such date or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue. We hereby consent to the use of our name under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus and the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit 8.1 to the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
