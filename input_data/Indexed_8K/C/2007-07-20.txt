Exhibit 99.1
        
        New York, NY, July 20, 2007Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) today reported net income for the 2007 second quarter of $6.23 billion, or $1.24 per share, both up 18%. International revenues and net income were a record, up 34% and 35% respectively. Return on equity was 20.1%.
Management Comment
        "We have very clear priorities to drive growth and we are executing on all of them. We generated record revenues, up 20%, and record earnings from continuing operations, up 18%, both driven by our record international results," said Charles Prince, Citi Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
        "We continued to generate revenue and volume growth in our U.S. consumer franchise, while making excellent progress in re-weighting Citi towards our other businesses, especially our international franchises, where revenues and net income increased over 30%. Our capital markets-driven businesses performed extremely well and international consumer revenues and volumes grew at a double-digit pace," said Prince.
        "We also began to implement the structural expense initiatives announced in April, which are generating improved efficiencies. These initiatives, coupled with strong revenue growth, drove positive operating leverage this quarter and helped offset increased credit costs."
        "We made excellent progress in expanding our business through targeted acquisitions, completing three international transactions, including an increase in our ownership of Nikko Cordial Corporation in Japan to 68%," said Prince.
Citi Segment Results
(1)
International results are fully reflected in the Total Citi results above, and exclude Alternative Investments and Corporate/Other.
 - 
Revenues
were a record, up 20%, led by 34% growth in international revenues. International markets & banking revenues grew 50%, international consumer revenues increased 16%, and wealth management revenues more than doubled.
 - 
Revenue growth reflected double-digit customer volume growth. Deposits and loans grew 20% and 17%, respectively. Securities and banking ranked #1 in global debt underwriting, #2 in announced M&A, and #3 in global equity underwriting, and achieved record revenues in equity markets and transaction services. In global wealth management, client assets under fee-based management grew 40%, and client capital in alternative investments increased 55%.
 - 
Strong volume growth drove a 16% increase in net interest revenues.
 - 
Excluding the impact of acquisitions, organic revenue growth was 16%.
 - 
The net interest margin declined 6 basis points versus the first quarter 2007, as the benefit from lower cost of funds was offset by growth in lower yielding trading assets.
 - 
Operating expenses
increased 16%, driven by increased business volumes and acquisitions, which were partially offset by savings from structural expense initiatives announced in April 2007, and the release of $300 million of litigation reserves reflecting our continued progress in favorably resolving WorldCom/Research matters(1).
 - 
The company opened or acquired 160 new retail bank or consumer finance branches during the quarter, including 136 internationally and 24 in the U.S. Over the last twelve months, 1,001 retail bank and consumer finance branches have been opened or acquired.
 - 
Excluding the impact of acquisitions, organic expense growth was 12%.
 - 
Credit costs
increased $934 million, primarily driven by an increase in net credit losses of $259 million and a net charge of $465 million to increase loan loss reserves. The $465 million net charge compares to a net reserve release of $210 million in the prior-year period.
 - 
In U.S. consumer, higher credit costs reflected an increase in net credit losses of $183 million and a net charge of $245 million to increase loan loss reserves. The $245 million net charge compares to a net reserve release of $274 million in the prior-year period. The increase in net credit losses and loan loss reserves primarily reflected higher delinquencies in second mortgages in consumer lending, a change in estimate of loan losses inherent in the cards portfolio, and portfolio growth.
 - 
In international consumer, higher credit costs reflected an increase in net credit losses of $155 million and a net charge to increase loan loss reserves of $236 million. The $236 million net charge compares to a net reserve release of $62 million in the prior-year period. The increase in net credit losses and loan loss reserves primarily reflected portfolio growth, an increase in past due accounts and portfolio seasoning in Mexico cards, higher net credit losses in Japan consumer finance, and the impact of recent acquisitions.
 - 
Markets & banking credit costs declined, reflecting a stable global credit environment and the absence of a $118 million increase to loan loss reserves recorded in the prior-year period.
 - 
Taxes.
The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 29.9% versus 30.3% in the prior-year period. The current period tax rate includes the impact of certain APB 23 benefits of $96 million described below.
 - 
Summary of highlighted items.
During the quarter, the following benefits were recorded:
(1)
Reserves were established in May 2004 for Enron, WorldCom, Research and IPO-related matters.
NM Not meaningful.
U.S. Consumer
        Revenues grew 3%, driven by higher average deposits, up 20%, and managed loans, up 8%; and expenses increased 3%. Credit costs were significantly higher due to the absence of loan loss reserve releases in the prior-year period, an increase in estimate of losses inherent in the cards portfolio, higher delinquencies in second mortgages, and portfolio growth. Higher credit costs drove a decline in net income.
 - 
U.S. Cards
 - 
Revenues declined as growth in non-interest revenues was offset by a decline in net interest revenues. Non-interest revenues increased 3%, driven by improved managed yields and higher volumes of securitized loans, offset by lower securitization gains. Net interest revenues declined 11% as improved net interest margins were offset by a decrease in on balance sheet loans. Expenses decreased 7%.
 - 
Average managed loans were flat as a 6% increase in purchase sales, driven by growth in travel, business, and partner portfolios, was offset by lower promotional balances. Lower promotional balances led to a 36 basis point improvement in the average managed yield.
 - 
Credit costs reflected a $240 million pre-tax charge to increase loan loss reserves for a change in estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio. The managed net credit loss ratio increased 44 basis points to 4.55%, primarily reflecting an increase in bankruptcy filings over unusually low filing levels experienced in the prior-year period. The credit environment remained stable.
 - 
Net income declined 17%, reflecting increased credit costs.
 - 
U.S. Retail Distribution
 - 
Revenues grew 2%, driven by higher average loans and deposits, up 16% and 20%, respectively, partially offset by the absence of a $132 million pre-tax gain on the sale of branches recorded in the prior-year period. Excluding the gain on sale, revenues grew 8%. Deposits in Citibank Direct Bank reached $13.8 billion. Volume growth was partially offset by lower net interest margins, reflecting a shift in customer deposits to higher yielding Direct Bank and time deposit balances.
 - 
Expenses increased 12% due to investment in new branches and higher customer activity. During the quarter, 15 new consumer finance branches and 9 new Citibank branches were opened. Total branches increased by 180 versus the prior year.
 - 
Credit costs were up 22%, driven by portfolio growth and an unusually low level of credit losses in the prior- year period. The net credit loss ratio increased 21 basis points to 2.86%. The credit environment remained stable.
 - 
Net income declined 20%, reflecting higher expenses and credit costs, and the absence of a gain on sale of branches in the prior-year period. Excluding the gain on sale, net income declined 8%.
 - 
U.S. Consumer Lending
 - 
Revenues increased 23%, driven by growth in net interest revenues and net servicing revenues, higher gains on sales of loans, and the acquisition of ABN AMRO Mortgage Group in March 2007. Net interest revenues grew 14% as growth in average loans, up 13%, offset a decline in net interest margins.
 - 
Expenses grew 25%, driven by the integration of the ABN AMRO business and increased business volumes.
 - 
Higher credit costs primarily reflected increased delinquencies and higher net credit losses on second mortgages, and portfolio growth. Higher credit costs also reflected the absence of a $75 million release of loan loss reserves in the prior-year period. The net credit loss ratio in real estate lending increased 21 basis points to 0.40%.
 - 
Net income declined 6%, reflecting higher expenses and credit costs.
 - 
U.S. Commercial Business
 - 
Revenues declined as increased loan and deposit balances, up 6% and 20%, respectively, were offset by lower net interest margins and an increase in the mix of tax-advantaged revenues.
 - 
Net income grew 9%, as lower revenues were offset by a decline in expenses and a tax benefit due to increased tax-advantaged revenues.
International Consumer
        Revenues increased 16%, driven by organic growth and the impact of recent acquisitions. Average deposits and loans were up 15% and 25%, respectively, and investment AUMs increased 35%. Expenses increased 21%, due to the integration of acquisitions and higher business volumes. Higher credit costs, and lower APB 23 tax benefits in Mexico, drove a decline in net income. Excluding Japan consumer finance, revenues were up 24% and net income declined 3%.
 - 
International Cards
 - 
Revenue and net income growth was driven by higher purchase sales and average loans, up 31% and 44%, respectively, and improved net interest margins. Loan balances grew at a double-digit pace in Mexico, EMEA, Asia and Latin America. Results include the integration of Credicard in Brazil and recent acquisitions.
 - 
Expenses grew 31%, reflecting investment spending, higher customer activity, and the integration of recent acquisitions.
 - 
Net income increased 7%, reflecting increased credit costs, up 67%. Credit costs increased primarily due to organic portfolio growth, acquisitions, and increased past due accounts and portfolio seasoning in Mexico.
 - 
International Consumer Finance
 - 
In Japan, revenues and net income declined due to lower receivable balances and increased customer refunds and credit costs. Results reflect recent changes in the operating environment and the fourth quarter 2006 passage of new consumer lending laws. The revenue decline also reflects a narrowing of the target market. Lower revenues were partially offset by a decline in expenses, driven by a repositioning of the business that included closing 273 branches and 101 automated loan machines since the third quarter of 2006.
 - 
Outside of Japan, revenues increased 23%, driven by average loan growth of 21% and stable net interest margins. Net income declined as revenue growth was offset by an increase in credit costs due to portfolio growth, target market expansion, and the absence of certain asset sales in the prior-year period that lowered net credit losses. The net credit loss ratio increased 85 basis points to 3.21%. The credit environment outside of Japan remained generally stable.
 - 
International Retail Banking
 - 
Revenues increased 19%, driven by increased deposits and loans, up 15% and 24%, respectively, and 46% growth in investment product sales. Loan growth was partially offset by net interest margin compression. Loan balances grew at a double-digit pace in EMEA, Asia, Latin America and Mexico. Results include the integration of recent acquisitions.
 - 
Expenses grew 24%, reflecting increased business volumes and acquisitions. During the quarter, 128 new branches were acquired or opened.
 - 
Credit costs increased as lower net credit losses, due to portfolio sales, were offset by the absence of a $105 million net release of loan loss reserves recorded in the prior-year period. The credit environment remained stable.
 - 
Net income declined 6%, reflecting higher credit costs, and lower APB 23 tax benefits in Mexico.
(1)
Includes a $300 million pre-tax release of litigation reserves noted above.

 - 
Smith Barney
 - 
Record revenues were driven by a 21% increase in fee-based and net interest revenues, reflecting improved net interest margins and a continued shift toward offering fee-based advisory products and services. Transactional revenues increased 48%, as a higher volume of new securities offerings drove increased customer trading. Revenues also reflect increased ownership of Nikko Cordial Corporation in Japan.
 - 
Assets under fee-based management increased 43% to $448 billion, primarily driven by positive market action, acquisitions, and net client asset flows.
 - 
Expenses increased 27%, primarily driven by increased customer activity and the impact of acquisitions.
 - 
Net income increased 35%, driven by increased business volumes and the impact of acquisitions.
 - 
Private Bank
 - 
Revenue growth was driven by a 32% increase in international revenues, reflecting strong growth in capital markets products in Asia. U.S. revenues declined 4% as increased business volumes were offset by net interest margin compression. Expense growth of 16% primarily reflected increased client activity, which led to higher compensation costs, including the net addition of 103 bankers since the second quarter of 2006.
 - 
Client business volumes increased 26%, including higher client assets under fee-based management, up 22%, and average loans, up 18%.

1)
Citi revenues excluding the impact of acquisitions.

International Consumer revenues excluding Japan Consumer Finance.
4)
U.S. Retail Distribution revenues excluding the gain on sale of upstate New York branches recorded in 2Q'06.

        The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a better understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of those results in prior periods as well as demonstrating the effects of unusual charges in the quarter. The Company believes that a meaningful analysis of its financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance. The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the Company's underlying performance.
        Reconciliation of the GAAP financial measures to the aforementioned non-GAAP measures follows:

 - 
Revenues declined as growth in non-interest revenues was offset by a decline in net interest revenues.

Average managed loans were flat as a 6% increase in purchase sales, driven by growth in travel, business, and partner portfolios, was offset by lower promotional balances. Lower promotional balances led to a 36 basis point improvement in the average managed yield.

Credit costs reflected a $240 million pre-tax charge to increase loan loss reserves for a change in estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio. The managed net credit loss ratio increased 44 basis points to 4.55%, primarily reflecting an increase in bankruptcy filings over unusually low filing levels experienced in the prior-year period.

 - 
Revenues increased 23%, driven by growth in net interest revenues and net servicing revenues, higher gains on sales of loans, and the acquisition of ABN AMRO Mortgage Group in March 2007. Net interest revenues grew 14% as growth in average loans, up 13%, offset a decline in net interest margins.
 - 
Expenses grew 25%, driven by the integration of the ABN AMRO business and increased business volumes.
 - 
Higher credit costs primarily reflected increased delinquencies and higher net credit losses on second mortgages, and portfolio growth. Higher credit costs also reflected the absence of a $75 million release of loan loss reserves in the prior-year period. The net credit loss ratio in real estate lending increased 21 basis points to 0.40%.
 - 
Net income declined 6%, reflecting higher expenses and credit costs.

 - 
In Japan, revenues and net income declined due to lower receivable balances and increased customer refunds and credit costs. Results reflect recent changes in the operating environment and the fourth quarter 2006 passage of new consumer lending laws. The revenue decline also reflects a narrowing of the target market. Lower revenues were partially offset by a decline in expenses, driven by a repositioning of the business that included closing 273 branches and 101 automated loan machines since the third quarter of 2006.
 - 
Outside of Japan, revenues increased 23%, driven by average loan growth of 21% and stable net interest margins. Net income declined as revenue growth was offset by an increase in credit costs due to portfolio growth, target market expansion, and the absence of certain asset sales in the prior-year period that lowered net credit losses. The net credit loss ratio increased 85 basis points to 3.21%. The credit environment outside of Japan remained generally stable.
