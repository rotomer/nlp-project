On November 4, 2007, Citigroup Inc. (the Company) issued a press release announcing that Charles Prince, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, elected to retire from the Company. Mr. Prince resigned from his position as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer effective November 5, 2007 and will retire from the Company effective December 31, 2007. A copy of the press release is being filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
(e)
 
In addition, on November 4, 2007, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the Agreement) with Charles Prince, setting forth the terms of Mr. Princes separation from the Company. Under the Agreement, Mr. Prince resigned from his position as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer on November 5, 2007 (the Resignation Date) and agreed to continue as an employee of the Company, to provide advice to the Chairman of the Board and the Acting Chief Executive Officer, until December 31, 2007 (the Retirement Date). Until the Retirement Date, Mr. Prince will receive salary payments at the same rate as before the Resignation Date and benefits at the level and type he was receiving before such date. The Agreement further provides that upon Mr. Prince providing the Company with a General Release (the General Release) in the form attached to the Agreement, he will receive certain payments and benefits as follows. All unvested outstanding employee stock options previously granted by the Company will vest on the Retirement Date and, provided Mr. Prince complies with the covenants pertaining to not competing with the Company or soliciting its employees or clients as described in the Agreement, his options will remain exercisable for up to 2 years following the Retirement Date (as of November 2, 2007, the intrinsic value of such in-the-money options was estimated to be $1,278,000, assuming a stock price of $37.73 per share). Any sale restrictions on shares distributed in connection with the exercise of options will not apply following the Retirement Date. All deferred stock awards previously granted to Mr. Prince under the Companys Capital Accumulation Plan on dates specified in the Agreement will fully vest on the 8
th
day following execution of the General Release and its delivery to the General Counsel (the Effective Date) provided the General Release has not been revoked prior to such date (as of November 2, 2007, the value of such awards was estimated to be $16,046,703, assuming a stock price of $37.73 per share). The restricted stock award granted to him on July 15, 2003 will vest on the Effective Date on a pro rata basis reflecting the period from July 15, 2003 through December 31, 2007 (as of November 2, 2007, the value of such award was estimated to be $10,716,469, assuming a stock price of $37.73 per share). Mr. Prince will receive a pro-rated incentive award for the 2007 compensation year in the form of a cash payment equal to (a) the pre-tax nominal value of the aggregate award package he received in early 2007 for the 2006 compensation year, increased or decreased by a percentage equal to the total shareholder return percentage (calculated in accordance with the Agreement) for 2007, multiplied by (b) 10/12. This amount will be determined and paid after December 31, 2007. The General Release was executed by Mr. Prince on November 4, 2007 and has not been revoked as of the date hereof.
As long as Mr. Prince complies with the covenants contained in the Agreement, the Company will provide him with an office, an administrative assistant, and a car and driver for the lesser of 5 years or until he commences full-time employment with another employer. The Company will pay certain taxes associated with such post-termination benefits. The Company acknowledges that Mr. Princes account balances under the Companys qualified and non-qualified pension plans, including the Citigroup Pension Plan, the Primerica Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, the Travelers Group Inc. Benefit Equalization Plan and the 401(k) plan were already 100% vested and are unaffected by the Agreement (as of December 31, 2006, the value of such benefits was estimated to be $1,427,648). Mr. Prince will also be paid any other amounts or benefits to which he is otherwise entitled under any plan, program, practice or policy of the Company in accordance with such plan, program, practice or policy; however, in no event will he be entitled to any severance pay under any such plan, program, practice or policy.
 
Under the Agreement, Mr. Prince agreed, for a period of 5 years, not to solicit certain Company employees and clients, or engage in any business that is in material competition with any of the Companys business operations.
The Agreement is being filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Mr. Charles O. Prince
399 Park Avenue
New York, NY 10022
 
Dear Chuck:
 
This Letter Agreement, together with the attachment hereto (collectively, the 
Agreement
), reflects our mutual understanding with respect to your separation from employment as a result of your retirement from Citigroup Inc. (the 
Company
, and together with its subsidiaries and their affiliates, 
Citigroup
) and sets forth the payments and benefits that you will be eligible to receive under this Agreement.
 
1.
  
Resignation
. You have advised us that you will resign from the Board of Directors of the Company, and from your position as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective as of the close of business on November 5, 2007 (the 
Resignation Date
). Effective with such resignation, you will no longer be a member of any board or internal management committee of the Company or Citigroup and you will have no authority to take any action on behalf of or otherwise bind the Company or Citigroup. You agree to make yourself available to the Chairman of the Board and the Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Company, on such basis as you and the Company determine to be reasonable, to provide active advice with respect to the conduct of the Companys business through December 31, 2007 (the 
Retirement Date
).
 
2.
  
Payments Through the Retirement Date
. Until the close of business on the Retirement Date, you will continue to receive
(a)
salary payments at your current annual base salary rate (less applicable withholdings and deductions), paid in accordance with the Companys payroll practices in the ordinary course and
 
(b)
the benefits at the level and of the type you currently receive. Your participation in the Citigroup Senior Officer Security Program will end at, and you will continue to be covered by the Stock Ownership Commitment, the Loan Policy, and the Personal Trading Policy until, the close of business on the Retirement Date.
 
3.
  
Post-Termination Health and Welfare Benefits
. Following the Retirement Date, you will be eligible for applicable medical and other benefits pursuant to the terms of the applicable plans and any changes thereto, and additional information concerning such benefits will be provided to you under separate cover.
 
 
4.
  
Other Payments and Benefits
. If within 22 days after the Resignation Date you sign the General Release in the form attached hereto as Attachment A (
General Release
) and it becomes effective, you will receive the following payments and benefits, subject to the conditions and restrictions and in the manner and time frames described in this paragraph
4
. You acknowledge and agree that certain of the payments and benefits described herein differ from and are in excess of the total payments and benefits you would otherwise be eligible to receive upon retirement, absent this Agreement.
 
(a)
  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the equity compensation plans or programs or award documents governing the outstanding employee stock options granted to you from the Company, all such options that are unvested as of the Retirement Date will vest in full as of the Retirement Date, and
provided
you comply with the provisions of paragraph
8
below, your options will remain exercisable for a period of 2 years following the Retirement Date, but in any event no later than the original expiration date of the option. Any sale restriction on shares distributed to you in connection with your exercise of employee stock options will no longer apply following the Retirement Date.
 
(b)
  
The deferred stock awards granted to you from the Company under the Capital Accumulation Program (
CAP
) on January 20, 2004, January 18, 2005, January 17, 2006 and January 16, 2007 (
i.e.
, all basic, premium and supplemental shares) will fully vest upon the Effective Date (as defined below) of the General Release and will be delivered to you on January 2, 2008.
 
(c)
  
The restricted stock award granted to you from the Company on July 15, 2003 will vest and the restrictions thereon will lapse on the Effective Date of the General Release on a pro rata basis reflecting the period from July 15, 2003 through December 31, 2007.
 
(d)
  
You will receive a pro-rated incentive award for the 2007 compensation year (the 
Incentive Award
) in the form of a cash payment in a gross amount not less than the following. The pre-tax nominal value of the aggregate award package you received in early 2007 for the 2006 compensation year will be multiplied by the Total Shareholder Return Percentage defined below and will be pro-rated by 10/12. The Incentive Award will not be subject to CAP (but will be subject to applicable withholdings and deductions) and will be paid on the date in early 2008 that incentive awards are paid to the other senior executives of the Company. For purposes of this paragraph
4(d)
, the Total Shareholder Return Percentage means (i) 100% plus or minus (ii) total shareholder return for the Company for the 2007 calendar year determined by (A) subtracting the closing price of a share of common stock of the Company (a 
Share
) on the last trading day of 2007 from the closing price of a Share of common stock of the Company stock on the last trading day of 2006 (
Starting Price
); (B) adding the aggregate ordinary dividends paid in respect of a Share during 2007; and (C) dividing the result by the Starting Price.

Taxes
), the Company will make additional payments (
Additional Payment
) to you or on your behalf to the appropriate tax authority, as determined by the Company, such that the Taxes associated with these services and the Taxes associated with the Additional Payment do not give rise to an out-of-pocket tax cost to you.

(b)
  
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph
10
, it shall not be a violation of this paragraph 10: (i) for any person to make truthful statements when required by order of a court or other body having jurisdiction, or as otherwise may be required by law or under an agreement entered into in connection with pending or threatened litigation pursuant to which the party receiving such information agrees to keep such information confidential or (ii) for you to respond to any disparaging or denigrating comment made by any director or executive officer.

Cooperation

(b)
  
You shall be indemnified for acts and omissions occurring on or prior to the Retirement Date to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. The Company agrees that for purposes of this paragraph
12(b)
it shall interpret and/or apply any provision of applicable law and the bylaws (including advancement of expenses and, in this connection, you agree to sign an appropriate undertaking as to the repayment of any such advances) with respect to you in a manner consistent with how such provision is interpreted and applied by the Company to then active executive officers of the Company. You shall be covered under the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policies in effect from time to time on the same basis that other former directors and officers are covered.
 
13.
  
Remedies
.
 
(a)
  
In the event the Board of Directors of the Company determines that you are in intentional and material breach of a covenant in paragraph 8, 10, 11 or 12 above, after written notice to you and your failure to cure the same within 90 days, you shall no longer be entitled to the benefits under paragraph 5 above.
 
(b)
  
Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and without limiting any remedies at law or in equity that may be available to the Company or you as provided herein or otherwise, you and the Company acknowledge and agree that a remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach of any covenant contained in paragraph
8
above would be inadequate and monetary damages would be difficult to calculate and that for any such breach or threatened breach, a court of law may award an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief, restraining you from committing or continuing to commit such breach.
 
6
 
(c)
  
It is expressly understood and agreed that if a final determination is made by a court of law that the time or any other restriction contained in paragraph
8
above is an unenforceable restriction against you, then the provisions of paragraph
8
above shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and to such other maximum extent as such court may determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any such court finds that any restriction contained in paragraph
8
above is unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.
 
(d)
  
Except as provided in subparagraph (b), any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any other agreement or arrangement between you and the Company, your employment with the Company, or the termination thereof (collectively, 
Covered Claims
) shall be resolved by binding arbitration, to be held in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.
 
(e)
  
In no event shall you be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable under this Agreement. There shall be no offset by the Company against your entitlements under this Agreement for any compensation or other amounts that you earn from subsequent employment or engagement of your services nor on account of any claim that Citigroup may have against you. In no event shall the Company have a right to offset against any account that you maintain with Citigroup, including, without limitation, any brokerage account, on account of any claims arising under this Agreement.
 
14.
  
Partial Invalidity
. Except with respect to the attached General Release, the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall have no effect upon, and shall not impair the validity or enforceability of, any other provision of this Agreement.
 
7
 
15.
  
Compliance with the American Jobs Creation Act
. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in this Agreement or in any equity or benefit plan maintained by Citigroup, any payment otherwise required to be made to you on account of your separation from service, within the meaning of the Section 409A Rules (as defined below), to the extent such payment (after taking into account all exclusions applicable to such payment under the Section 409A Rules) is properly treated as deferred compensation subject to the Section 409A Rules, shall not be made until the first business day after
(i)
the expiration of six (6) months from the date of your separation from service, or
(ii)
if earlier, the date of your death (the 
Delayed Payment Date
). On the Delayed Payment Date, there shall be paid to you or, if you died, your estate, in a single cash lump sum, an amount equal to aggregate amount of the payments delayed pursuant to the preceding sentence. In the case of this Agreement and each plan under which you are entitled to receive amounts treated as deferred compensation subject to the Section 409A Rules and which provides for payment of such amounts in the form of a series of installment payments, as defined in Treas. Reg.  1.409A-2(b)(iii), (A) your right to receive such payments shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments under Treas. Reg.  1.409A-2(b)(iii), and (B) to the extent this Agreement or such plan does not already so provide, it is hereby amended to so provide, with respect to amounts payable to you thereunder. For purposes of this paragraph
15
, the 
Section 409A Rules
 shall mean Section 409A of the Code, the regulations issued thereunder, and all notices, rulings and other guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service interpreting same.

For Immediate Release
Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C)
November 4, 2007
ROBERT E. RUBIN TO SERVE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF CITI
SIR WIN BISCHOFF TO SERVE AS ACTING CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
CHARLES PRINCE ELECTS TO RETIRE FROM CITI
NEW YORK - The Board of Directors of Citigroup Inc. today announced that Robert E. Rubin, Chairman of the Executive
 
Committee of Citi and a member of the Board of Directors, will serve as Chairman of the Board.
In addition, Sir Win Bischoff, Chairman of Citi Europe and a member of Citis Business Heads, Operating and Management Committees, will serve as acting Chief Executive Officer. The Board also announced that Charles Prince, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has elected to retire from Citi. The Board has designated a special committee consisting of Mr. Rubin, Alain J.P. Belda, Richard D. Parsons, and Franklin A. Thomas to conduct the search for a new CEO.
Mr. Prince commented, We have made strong progress in our strategy for building for the future, evidenced in the momentum we have achieved in most of our businesses. Nevertheless, it is my judgment that given the size of the recent losses in our mortgage- backed securities business, the only honorable course for me to take as Chief Executive Officer is to step down. This is what I advised the Board.
It has been my privilege to lead this powerful diversified financial services company for the past four years and to be affiliated with the directors, shareholders and employees of Citi and its predecessor companies for the past 29 years. I am proud of the significant progress we have made in rapidly building and expanding the scope of our businesses internationally, strengthening our businesses domestically, and restoring excellent relationships with our regulators throughout the world.
Mr. Belda said, Chuck has been an extraordinarily committed leader who took on many difficult issues that needed to be addressed and strengthened Citis position for the future. He moved the company toward its higher margin businesses, investing in areas where we have key competitive advantages. He augmented our unrivaled international franchise through groundbreaking acquisitions and partnerships, greatly improved our technology, and invested in our people. We thank Chuck for his unwavering commitment to Citi, its employees and its shareholders. Citi has extraordinary people and the Board is committed to working together with them to see that Citi realizes its tremendous potential. We are fortunate that Chuck will continue to serve the Company in an advisory capacity while a search for his replacement is underway.
 
 
 
Mr. Rubin said, The Board and I have tremendous respect for Chucks leadership and his accomplishments over the years in helping to develop the Companys culture and direction and honing its formidable competitive advantages. Citi is a unique global institution with a strong capital base, industry-leading businesses and above all, tremendously talented employees, who are our most important asset. I intend to work closely with the Board, Win, and the operating and executive leadership to maintain the momentum of our business. We will continue to focus on taking the steps necessary to help our employees realize their full potential, serve our customers with distinction, and build superior value for all of our shareholders.
We intend to complete our search for a new CEO as expeditiously as possible, reviewing qualified CEO candidates from outside as well as within our organization. In the interim, we have in Win an acting CEO who has had a distinguished and successful career in the financial industry, serving as Chairman of Schroders plc before joining Citi in 2000 with the acquisition of Schroders investment banking business by a Citi predecessor company. Most recently, he has chaired our growing businesses in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
In addition, a new unit, the sole focus of which will be on managing the assets related to sub-prime mortgage securities and their resultant exposures, has been established. This unit will be separate from the other parts of our capital markets and banking business, Mr. Rubin said.
As Acting CEO, I am pleased to be able to draw on the talents of our distinguished and committed Board and experienced management team. Together, we will see that our current plans are effectively executed and will continue to consider new ways to strengthen and grow our businesses, Sir Win said.
