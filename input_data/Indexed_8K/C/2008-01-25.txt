EXHIBIT 1.01
New York, New York January 17, 2008
Citigroup Global Markets Inc.    as Representative of the several Underwriters c/o Citigroup Global Markets Inc. 388 Greenwich Street New York, New York 10013
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          Citigroup Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware (the "Company"), proposes, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, to issue and sell 58,000,000 depositary shares (the "Depositary Shares"), each representing a 1/1,000 interest in a share of perpetual 6.5% Non-Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series T (the "Convertible Preferred Stock"), of the Company (the "Underwritten Securities") to the several Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you (the "Representative") are acting as representative. The Company also proposes to grant the Underwriters an option to purchase 8,700,000 additional Depositary Shares to cover over-allotments (the "Option Securities" and, together with the Underwritten Securities, the "Securities"). The Convertible Preferred Stock shall have the rights, powers and preferences set forth in the certificate of designation dated January 23, 2008 relating thereto (the "Certificate of Designation") and shall be convertible into shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"), as set forth in the Certificate of Designation. The shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Securities are to be deposited by the Company against delivery of depositary receipts evidencing Depositary Shares (the "Depositary Receipts") that are to be issued by The Bank of New York, as Depositary (the "Depositary"), under a Deposit Agreement, to be dated as of January 23, 2008 (the "Deposit Agreement"), among the Company, the Depositary and the holders from time to time of the Depositary Receipts issued thereunder.
th
          The Company wishes to confirm as follows its agreement with you and the other several Underwriters listed on Schedule I on whose behalf you are acting, in connection with the several purchases of the Securities by the Underwriters. To the extent there are no additional Underwriters listed on Schedule I other than you, the term Representatives as used herein shall mean you, as Underwriters, and the terms Representatives and Underwriters shall mean either the singular or plural as the context requires. Any reference herein to the Registration Statement,
 
the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Exchange Act on or before the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference. Certain terms used herein are defined in Section 21 hereof.
          1. . The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Act and has prepared and filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement, as defined in Rule 405 (File No. 333-132177), including a related Base Prospectus, for registration under the Act of the offering and sale of the Securities. Such Registration Statement, including any amendments thereto filed prior to the date hereof, became effective upon filing. The Company may have filed with the Commission, as part of an amendment to the Registration Statement or pursuant to Rule 424(b), one or more Preliminary Prospectuses relating to the Securities, each of which has previously been furnished to you. The Company will file with the Commission a Final Prospectus relating to the Securities in accordance with Rule 424(b). As filed, such Final Prospectus shall contain all information required by the Act and the rules thereunder, and, except to the extent the Representative shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to you prior to the date hereof or, to the extent not completed by the date hereof, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Base Prospectus and any Preliminary Prospectus) as the Company has advised you, prior to the date hereof, will be included or made therein. The Registration Statement, as of the date hereof, meets the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x). The initial Effective Date of the Registration Statement was not earlier than the date three years before the date hereof.
Registration Statement and Prospectus
          2. . (a) The Company hereby agrees, subject to all the terms and conditions set forth herein, to issue and sell to each Underwriter and, upon the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained and subject to all the terms and conditions set forth herein each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at a purchase price of $48.50 per Security, the number of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto (or such number of Securities increased as set forth in Section 11 hereof).
Agreements to Sell and Purchase
          Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company hereby grants an option to the several Underwriters to purchase, severally and not jointly, up to 8,700,000 Option Securities at the same purchase price per share as the Underwriters shall pay for the Underwritten Securities. Said option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time or from time to time on or before the 30 day after the date of the Final Prospectus, upon written or facsimile notice by the Representative to the Company setting forth the number of Option Securities as to which the several Underwriters are exercising the option and the date on which delivery and payment shall occur, which shall not be
th
 
less than three Business Days after the date of the notice of exercise. The number of Option Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be the same percentage of the total number of Option Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters as such Underwriter is purchasing of the Underwritten Securities, subject to such adjustments as the Representative, in its absolute discretion, shall make to eliminate any fractional shares.
          3. . It is understood that the several Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale to the public as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.
Offering by Underwriters
          4. . Delivery to the Underwriters of, and payment for, the Underwritten Securities shall be made at the office of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York 10006, at 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on January 23, 2008 (the "Closing Date"). Delivery to the Underwriters of, and payment for, the Option Securities (if the option provided for in Section 2(b) hereof is exercised) shall be made on the date and at the time specified in the notice of exercise of the option, which shall not be less than three Business Days after the date of the notice. The place of closing for the Underwritten Securities and the Closing Date may be varied by agreement between you and the Company.
Delivery of the Securities and Payment Therefor
          Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Representative for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters directly or through the Representative of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Company by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to an account specified by the Company. Delivery of the Securities shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company unless the Representative shall otherwise instruct.
          It is understood that the Representative, acting individually and not in a representative capacity, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment to the Company on behalf of any other Underwriter for Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter. Any such payment by the Representative shall not relieve any such Underwriter of any of its obligations hereunder.
          5. . The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
Agreements of the Company
     (a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus unless the Company has furnished the Representative a copy for their review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which they reasonably object. The Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto, to be filed in a form acceptable to the Representative with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representative of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representative (1) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (2) when, prior to
 
termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (3) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (4) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice objecting to its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (5) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the occurrence of any such suspension or objection to the use of the Registration Statement and, upon such issuance, occurrence or notice of objection, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or objection, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.
     (b) The Company will prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of final terms of the Securities and the offering thereof, in a form acceptable to you (the "Final Term Sheet") and to file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time required by such Rule.
     (c) If, at any time prior to the filing of the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, the Company will (i) notify promptly the Representative so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
     (d) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Representative of such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Final Prospectus and
 
(iv) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to the Representative in such quantities as the Representative may reasonably request.
     (e) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representative a consolidated earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158.
     (f) Upon request, the Company will furnish to the Representative and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representative may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering that are required to be prepared, furnished or delivered by the Company.
     (g) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as the Representative reasonably may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (as successor to the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.), in connection with its review of the offering; that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
provided
     (h) (i) The Company agrees that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Representative, and (ii) each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than the Final Term Sheet described above or other free writing prospectuses containing solely a description of the final terms of the Securities and the offering thereof. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representative or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
 
     (i) For a period of 60 days from the date of the Final Prospectus, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company), directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any shares of Common Stock or preferred stock or any other capital stock of the Company, including any other shares of convertible preferred stock or any capital stock convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, shares of Common Stock, except for (i) the offering of the Securities, (ii) the additional convertible preferred stock of the Company being sold in private placements concurrently with the offering of the Securities and the non-convertible preferred stock of the Company being sold in a U.S. public offering concurrently with the offering of the Securities, in each case as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, (iii) the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the definitive share exchange agreement between Citigroup Japan Holdings and Nikko Cordial Corporation, as described in the Company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 31, 2007, (iv) any shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred stock and (v) issuances and sales of Common Stock pursuant to any employee stock option plan, stock ownership plan, dividend reinvestment plan or similar plan of the Company.
     (j) The Company will comply with all applicable securities and other laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and use its best efforts to cause the Company's directors and officers, in their capacities as such, to comply with such laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.
     (k) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities, except that the Company makes no agreement as to the activities of any Underwriter.
     (l) The Company will reserve and keep available at all times, free of preemptive rights, the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock.
     (m) The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to furnish to the Representative a letter addressed to the Representative substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto from each of the persons listed in Exhibit B hereto.
          6. . The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that:

     (f) The shares of Common Stock initially issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock have been duly authorized by the Company and, when issued upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock against payment of the conversion price, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable; the board of directors of the Company or an authorized committee thereof has duly and validly adopted resolutions

     (g) As of the date hereof, the Disclosure Package does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 7 hereof.
     (h) (i) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), (iii) at the time the Company or any person acting on their behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c)) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption in Rule 163 and (iv) on the date hereof (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (iv)), the Company was or is (as the case may be) a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405.

     (i) (i) At the earliest time after the filing of the Registration Statement that the Company or another offering participant made a offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2)) of the Securities and (ii) as of the date hereof (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (ii)), the Company was not and is not an Ineligible Issuer (as defined in Rule 405), without taking account of any determination by the Commission pursuant to Rule 405 that it is not necessary that the Company be considered an Ineligible Issuer.

specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 7 hereof.
          Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company and delivered to the Representative or counsel for the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company, as to matters covered thereby, to each Underwriter.
          7. .
Indemnification and Contribution
     (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided, however
     (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (ii) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (iii) the sentences related to concessions and
 
reallowances and (iv) the paragraphs related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
provided, however
     (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to
 
which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).

Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
          11. .

           13. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

       as Representative of the several Underwriters
c/o Citigroup Global Markets Inc. 388 Greenwich Street New York, New York 10013
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          Citigroup Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware (the "Company"), proposes, upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, to issue and sell 130,000,000 depositary shares (the "Depositary Shares"), each representing a 1/1,000 interest in a share of perpetual 8.125% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series AA (the "Preferred Stock"), of the Company (the "Underwritten Securities") to the several Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you (the "Representative") are acting as representative. The Company also proposes to grant the Underwriters an option to purchase 19,500,000 additional Depositary Shares to cover over-allotments (the "Option Securities" and, together with the Underwritten Securities, the "Securities"). The Preferred Stock shall have the rights, powers and preferences set forth in the certificate of designation dated January 23, 2008 relating thereto (the "Certificate of Designation"). The shares of Preferred Stock represented by the Securities are to be deposited by the Company against delivery of depositary receipts evidencing Depositary Shares (the "Depositary Receipts") that are to be issued by The Bank of New York, as Depositary (the "Depositary"), under a Deposit Agreement, to be dated as of January 23, 2008 (the "Deposit Agreement"), among the Company, the Depositary and the holders from time to time of the Depositary Receipts issued thereunder.
th
          The Company wishes to confirm as follows its agreement with you and the other several Underwriters listed on Schedule I on whose behalf you are acting, in connection with the several purchases of the Securities by the Underwriters. To the extent there are no additional Underwriters listed on Schedule I other than you, the term Representatives as used herein shall mean you, as Underwriters, and the terms Representatives and Underwriters shall mean either the singular or plural as the context requires. Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Exchange Act on or before the Effective Date of the Registration
 
Statement or the issue date of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference. Certain terms used herein are defined in Section 21 hereof.
          1. . The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Act and has prepared and filed with the Commission an automatic shelf registration statement, as defined in Rule 405 (File No. 333-132177), including a related Base Prospectus, for registration under the Act of the offering and sale of the Securities. Such Registration Statement, including any amendments thereto filed prior to the date hereof, became effective upon filing. The Company may have filed with the Commission, as part of an amendment to the Registration Statement or pursuant to Rule 424(b), one or more Preliminary Prospectuses relating to the Securities, each of which has previously been furnished to you. The Company will file with the Commission a Final Prospectus relating to the Securities in accordance with Rule 424(b). As filed, such Final Prospectus shall contain all information required by the Act and the rules thereunder, and, except to the extent the Representative shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to you prior to the date hereof or, to the extent not completed by the date hereof, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Base Prospectus and any Preliminary Prospectus) as the Company has advised you, prior to the date hereof, will be included or made therein. The Registration Statement, as of the date hereof, meets the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x). The initial Effective Date of the Registration Statement was not earlier than the date three years before the date hereof.
Registration Statement and Prospectus
          2. . (a) The Company hereby agrees, subject to all the terms and conditions set forth herein, to issue and sell to each Underwriter and, upon the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained and subject to all the terms and conditions set forth herein each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at a purchase price of $24.2125 per Security, provided, however, that with respect to sales made by the Underwriters to certain certain institutional purchasers, the purchase price instead shall be $24.5000 per Security. The Representative confirms to the Company that for this purpose the number of Underwritten Securities sold to such institutional purchasers is 66,200,000, the number of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto (or such number of Securities increased as set forth in Section 11 hereof).
Agreements to Sell and Purchase
          Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company hereby grants an option to the several Underwriters to purchase, severally and not jointly, up to 19,500,000 Option Securities at the same purchase price per share as the Underwriters shall pay for the Underwritten Securities. Said option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time or from time to time on or before the 30 day after the date of the Final Prospectus, upon written or facsimile notice by the Representative to the Company setting forth the number of Option Securities as to which the several Underwriters are
th
 
exercising the option and the date on which delivery and payment shall occur, which shall not be less than three Business Days after the date of the notice of exercise. The number of Option Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be the same percentage of the total number of Option Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters as such Underwriter is purchasing of the Underwritten Securities, subject to such adjustments as the Representative, in its absolute discretion, shall make to eliminate any fractional shares.
          3. . It is understood that the several Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale to the public as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.
Offering by Underwriters
          4. . Delivery to the Underwriters of, and payment for, the Underwritten Securities shall be made at the office of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York 10006, at 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on January 23, 2008 (the "Closing Date"). Delivery to the Underwriters of, and payment for, the Option Securities (if the option provided for in Section 2(b) hereof is exercised) shall be made on the date and at the time specified in the notice of exercise of the option, which shall not be less than three Business Days after the date of the notice. The place of closing for the Underwritten Securities and the Closing Date may be varied by agreement between you and the Company.
Delivery of the Securities and Payment Therefor
          Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Representative for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters directly or through the Representative of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Company by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to an account specified by the Company. Delivery of the Securities shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company unless the Representative shall otherwise instruct.
          It is understood that the Representative, acting individually and not in a representative capacity, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment to the Company on behalf of any other Underwriter for Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter. Any such payment by the Representative shall not relieve any such Underwriter of any of its obligations hereunder.
          5. . The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
Agreements of the Company
     (a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus unless the Company has furnished the Representative a copy for their review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which they reasonably object. The Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto, to be filed in a form acceptable to the Representative with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representative of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representative (1) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto,
 
shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (2) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (3) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (4) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice objecting to its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (5) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the occurrence of any such suspension or objection to the use of the Registration Statement and, upon such issuance, occurrence or notice of objection, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or objection, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.
     (b) The Company will prepare a final term sheet, containing solely a description of final terms of the Securities and the offering thereof, in a form acceptable to you (the "Final Term Sheet") and to file such term sheet pursuant to Rule 433(d) within the time required by such Rule.
     (c) If, at any time prior to the filing of the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, the Company will (i) notify promptly the Representative so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
     (d) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Representative of such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective
 
as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Final Prospectus and (iv) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to the Representative in such quantities as the Representative may reasonably request.
     (e) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representative a consolidated earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158.
     (f) Upon request, the Company will furnish to the Representative and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representative may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering that are required to be prepared, furnished or delivered by the Company.
     (g) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as the Representative reasonably may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (as successor to the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.), in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
     (h) (i) The Company agrees that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Representative, and (ii) each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees with the Company that, unless it has obtained or will obtain, as the case may be, the prior written consent of the Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or that would otherwise constitute a "free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 405) required to be filed by the Company with the Commission or retained by the Company under Rule 433, other than the Final Term Sheet described above or other free writing prospectuses containing solely a description of the final terms of the Securities and the offering thereof. Any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representative or the Company is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.
 
     (i) During the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing to and including the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company) directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any shares of preferred stock or any other securities of the Company, including any back-up undertaking of such preferred stock or other securities, in each case that are substantially similar to the preferred stock, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for such preferred stock or such substantially similar securities of the Company, except (i) the offering of the Securities, (ii) the convertible preferred stock of the Company being sold in private placements concurrently with the offering of the Securities and the convertible preferred stock of the Company being sold in a U.S. public offering concurrently with the offering of the Securities, in each case as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, (iii) the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the definitive share exchange agreement between Citigroup Japan Holdings and Nikko Cordial Corporation, as described in the Company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 31, 2007, and (iv) issuances and sales of Common Stock pursuant to any employee stock option plan, stock ownership plan, dividend reinvestment plan or similar plan of the Company.
     (j) The Company will comply with all applicable securities and other laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and use its best efforts to cause the Company's directors and officers, in their capacities as such, to comply with such laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.
     (k) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities, except that the Company makes no agreement as to the activities of any Underwriter.
          6. . The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that:
Representations and Warranties of the Company
     (a) On each Effective Date, the Registration Statement did, and when the Final Prospectus is first filed in accordance with Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date, the Final Prospectus (and any supplement thereto) will, comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective rules thereunder; on each Effective Date and on the date hereof, the Registration Statement did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

     (f) The holders of outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are not entitled to preemptive or other rights to subscribe for the Securities or the underlying shares of Preferred Stock; and, except as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, no options, warrants or other rights to purchase, agreements or other obligations to issue, or rights to convert any obligations into or exchange any securities for, shares of capital stock of or ownership interests in the Company are outstanding.
     (g) As of the date hereof, the Disclosure Package does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use
 
therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 7 hereof.
     (h) (i) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), (iii) at the time the Company or any person acting on their behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c)) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption in Rule 163 and (iv) on the date hereof (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (iv)), the Company was or is (as the case may be) a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405.

     (j) Neither any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus nor the Final Term Sheet includes any information that conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement, including any document incorporated therein and any prospectus supplement deemed to be a part thereof that has not been superseded or modified. The foregoing sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus nor the Final Term Sheet based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 7 hereof.

          7. .
Indemnification and Contribution
     (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or
 
any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
     (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (ii) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (iii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iv) the paragraphs related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided
 
in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
     (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total
 
underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 7, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
          8. .

     (c) The Company shall have requested and caused Michael S. Zuckert, General Counsel, Finance and Capital Markets of the Company, to have furnished to the Representative an opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representative, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representative may reasonably require.

     (i) Subsequent to the date hereof, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.

The Company agrees to pay the following costs and expenses and all other costs and expenses incident to the performance by it of its obligations hereunder: (i) the preparation, printing or reproduction, and filing with the Commission of the Registration Statement (including financial statements and exhibits thereto), any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus (including filing fees), each amendment or supplement to any of them, this Agreement; (ii) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery (including postage, air freight charges and charges for counting and packaging) of such copies of the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, the documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, and all amendments or supplements to any of them, as may be reasonably requested for use in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities; (iii) the preparation, printing (or reproduction), authentication, issuance and delivery of the Securities, including any stamp taxes in connection with the original issuance and sale of the Securities; (iv) the printing (or reproduction) and delivery of this Agreement and all other agreements, documents and certificates (including certificates representing the Preferred Stock) printed (or reproduced) and delivered in connection with the offering of the Securities; (v) the registration of the Securities under the Exchange Act and the listing of the Securities on the New York Stock Exchange; (vi) the registration or qualification of the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of the several states as provided in Section 5(g) hereof (including the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters relating to the preparation, printing (or reproduction), and delivery of the preliminary and supplemental Blue Sky Memoranda and such registration and qualification); (vii) the filing fees and the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with any filings required to be made with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (as successor to the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.); (viii) the fees and expenses associated with obtaining ratings for the Securities from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; (ix) the transportation and other expenses incurred by or on behalf of representatives of the Company (other than the Underwriters and their representatives) in connection with presentations to prospective purchasers of the Securities; (x) the fees and expenses of the Company's accountants and the fees and expenses of counsel (including local and special counsel) for the Company; and (xi) the fees and expenses of the Depositary in connection with the deposit of the Preferred Stock and the offering of the Securities.
Expenses
          10. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 8 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 11 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representative on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses
 
disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
          11. .

However, such shares, upon surrender for
Conversion Following A Record Date.
 
conversion, must be accompanied by funds equal to the dividend on such shares; provided that no such payment need be made (i) if the Company has issued a notice of redemption of the Convertible Preferred Stock, (ii) if the Company has issued a notice of conversion at its option of the Convertible Preferred Stock, or (iii) if a conversion is made in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition or Fundamental Change, in each case in accordance with the terms hereof.

CR
1
= CR

where,
               However, if the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (iii) is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of the Company of, or similar equity interests in, a subsidiary or other business unit of ours, (i.e., a spin-off) that are, or, when issued, will be, traded on a U.S. securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, then the Conversion Rate will instead be adjusted based on the following formula:

where,
               The dividend threshold amount is subject to adjustment on an inversely proportional basis whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, provided that no adjustment will be made to the dividend threshold amount for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this clause (iv).
               (v) the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries make purchases of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company for Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the "expiration date"), in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:

No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent; provided, however, that any such minor adjustments that are not required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and provided further that any such adjustment of less than one percent that has not been made will be made upon (x) the end of each fiscal year of the Company, (y) the date of any notice of redemption of the Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof or any notice of a Make-Whole Acquisition and (z) any Conversion Date.

The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 14(b)(iv).  In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the Holders (together with holders of any other class of the Company's authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders.

The terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, and the number of directors constituting the Board of

Senior Issuances; Adverse Changes.
          (i) any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Company's certificate of incorporation (including the certificate of designation creating the Convertible Preferred Stock) or the Company's by-laws that would alter or change the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Convertible Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely;
          (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company's certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of the Company's capital stock ranking prior to the Convertible Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company; or
          (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Convertible Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Convertible Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Convertible Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Convertible Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Convertible Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights,
 
preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Convertible Preferred Stock, taken as a whole;
          , that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Convertible Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and/or junior to the Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of assets upon the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Convertible Preferred Stock and Holders will have no right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance.
provided, however
     If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 14(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock).
     (d) No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 14(b) or (c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above.

Section 18. Unissued or Reacquired Shares.

Adjustments.
 
     (i) the issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock, or a subdivision or combination of Common Stock, in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     
CR
1
= CR
0
x (OS
1
/ OS
0
)
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will be made for the issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock that is made in lieu of a quarterly or annual cash dividend or distribution to such holders, to the extent such dividend or distribution does not exceed the applicable Dividend Threshold Amount. The amount of any such dividend or distribution will equal the number of such shares being issued multiplied by the average of the VWAP of the Common Stock over each of the five consecutive Trading Days prior to the Ex-date for such dividend or distribution.
     (ii) the issuance to all holders of Common Stock of certain rights or warrants entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price as of the Record Date, in which event each Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     
CR
1
= CR
0
x (OS
0
+ X) / (OS
0
+ Y)
 
     However, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the extent that any such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration.
     (iii) the dividend or other distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of capital stock of the Company (other than common stock) or evidences of its indebtedness or its assets (excluding any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by clauses (i) or (ii) above or (iv) or (v) below) in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
       
CR
1
= CR
0
x SP
0
/ (SP
0
- FMV)
     However, if the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (iii) is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of the Company of, or similar equity interests in, a subsidiary or other business unit of ours, (i.e., a spin-off) that are, or, when issued, will be, traded on a U.S. securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, then the Conversion Rate will instead be adjusted based on the following formula:
       
CR
1
= CR
0
x (FMV
0
+ MP
0
) / MP
0
 
     (iv) the Company makes a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of Common Stock, excluding (a) any cash dividend on Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of Common Stock does not exceed (i) $0.32 in any fiscal quarter in the case of a quarterly dividend or (ii) $1.28 in the prior twelve months in the case of an annual dividend (each such number, the ""), (b) any cash that is distributed as part of a distribution referred to in clause (iii) above, and (c) any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any its subsidiaries referred to in clause (v) below, in which event, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
Dividend Threshold Amount
          
CR
1
= CR
0
x SP
0
/ (SP
0
- C)
     The dividend threshold amount is subject to adjustment on an inversely proportional basis whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, provided that no adjustment will be made to the dividend threshold amount for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this clause (iv).
     (v) the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries make purchases of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company for Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the "expiration date"), in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
       
CR
1
= CR
0
x
[
(FMV + (SP
1
x OS
1
)
]
/ (SP

)
     (b) All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated by the Company to the nearest 1/10,000th of one share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent; provided, however, that any such minor adjustments that are not required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and provided further that any such adjustment of less than one percent that has not been made will be made upon (x) the end of each fiscal year of the Company, (y) the date of any notice of redemption of the Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof or any notice of a Make-Whole Acquisition and (z) any Conversion Date.

     (ii) any amendment or alteration of the Company's certificate of incorporation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into shares of, any class or series of the Company's capital stock ranking prior to the Convertible Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company; or
     (iii) the consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Convertible Preferred Stock or a merger or consolidation of the Company with another entity, except that holders of Convertible Preferred Stock will have no right to vote under this provision or otherwise under Delaware law if in each case (i) the Convertible Preferred Stock remains outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Company is not the surviving or resulting entity, is converted into or exchanged for preferred securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, that is an entity organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia and that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or if such entity is not a corporation, the Company having received an opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters to the effect that Holders will be subject to tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to such new preferred securities after such merger or consolidation in the same amount, at the same time and otherwise in the same manner as would have been the case under the Convertible Preferred Stock prior to such merger or consolidation), and (ii) such Convertible Preferred Stock remaining outstanding or such preferred securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights,
 
preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Convertible Preferred Stock, taken as a whole;
     , that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Convertible Preferred Stock or authorized preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of preferred stock or any securities convertible into preferred stock ranking equally with and/or junior to the Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and/or the distribution of assets upon the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding up will not be deemed to adversely affect the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Convertible Preferred Stock and Holders will have no right to vote on such an increase, creation or issuance.
provided, however
     If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 14(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all series of preferred stock of the Company, then only such series of preferred stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a single class (in lieu of all other series of preferred stock).
     (d) No vote or consent of the Holders shall be required pursuant to Section 14(b) or (c) if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, the Company shall have redeemed or shall have called for redemption all outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, with proper notice and sufficient funds having been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above.

Adjustments.
 
     (i) the issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock, or a subdivision or combination of Common Stock, in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     
CR
1
= CR
0
x (OS
1
/ OS
0
)
     where,
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will be made for the issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock that is made in lieu of a quarterly or annual cash dividend or distribution to such holders, to the extent such dividend or distribution does not exceed the applicable Dividend Threshold Amount.

     (ii) the issuance to all holders of Common Stock of certain rights or warrants entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price as of the Record Date, in which event each Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     
CR
1
= CR
0
x (OS
0
+ X) / (OS
0
+ Y)
     where,
 
     However, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the extent that any such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration.
     (iii) the dividend or other distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of capital stock of the Company (other than common stock) or evidences of its indebtedness or its assets (excluding any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by clauses (i) or (ii) above or (iv) or (v) below) in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     
CR
1
= CR
0
x SP
0
/ (SP
0
- FMV)
     where,
     However, if the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (iii) is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of the Company of, or similar equity interests in, a subsidiary or other business unit of ours, (i.e., a spin-off) that are, or, when issued, will be, traded on a U.S. securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, then the Conversion Rate will instead be adjusted based on the following formula:
     
CR
1
= CR
0
x (FMV
0
+ MP
0
) / MP
0
     where,
 
     (iv) the Company makes a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of Common Stock, excluding (a) any cash dividend on Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of Common Stock does not exceed (i) $0.32 in any fiscal quarter in the case of a quarterly dividend or (ii) $1.28 in the prior twelve months in the case of an annual dividend (each such number, the ""), (b) any cash that is distributed as part of a distribution referred to in clause (iii) above, and (c) any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any its subsidiaries referred to in clause (v) below, in which event, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
Dividend Threshold Amount
     
CR
1
= CR
0
x SP
0
/ (SP
0
- C)
     where,
     The dividend threshold amount is subject to adjustment on an inversely proportional basis whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, provided that no adjustment will be made to the dividend threshold amount for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this clause (iv).
     (v) the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries make purchases of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company for Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the "expiration date"), in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     
CR
1
= CR
0
x
[
(FMV + (SP
1
x OS
1
)
]
/ (SP
1
x OS
0
)
     where,
 
     (b) All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated by the Company to the nearest 1/10,000th of one share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent; provided, however, that any such minor adjustments that are not required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and provided further that any such adjustment of less than one percent that has not been made will be made upon (x) the end of each fiscal year of the Company, (y) the date of any notice of redemption of the Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof or any notice of a Make-Whole Acquisition and (z) any Conversion Date.

     (b) If the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof does not declare a dividend on the Convertible Preferred Stock for any Dividend Period prior to the related Dividend Payment Date, that dividend will not accrue, and the Company will have no obligation to pay, and Holders shall have no right to receive, a dividend for that Dividend Period on the related Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other series of preferred stock or common stock are declared for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to Convertible Preferred Stock, Parity Stock, Junior Stock or any other class or series of authorized preferred stock of the Company. References herein to the "accrual" of dividends refer only to the determination of the amount of such dividend and do not imply that any right to a dividend arises prior to the date on which a dividend is declared.
Non-Cumulative Dividends.
     (c) So long as any share of Convertible Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless as to a Dividend Payment Date full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the Dividend Period then ending, the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding Dividend Period that commences on such Dividend Payment Date, declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any of Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than:

     (vi) the purchase of Junior Stock by any investment banking subsidiary of the Company in connection with market-making or other secondary market activities in the ordinary course of the business of such subsidiary.
     The foregoing restriction, however, will not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid.
     Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Convertible Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of Convertible Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of any Parity Stock (including, in the case of any such Parity Stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other.

If the Conversion Date for any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock is after the close of business on a Dividend Record Date for any declared dividend for the then-current Dividend Period, but prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, the Holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive such dividend, notwithstanding the conversion of such shares prior to the Dividend Payment Date. However, such shares, upon surrender for
Conversion Following A Record Date.
 
conversion, must be accompanied by funds equal to the dividend on such shares; provided that no such payment need be made (i) if the Company has issued a notice of redemption of the Convertible Preferred Stock, (ii) if the Company has issued a notice of conversion at its option of the Convertible Preferred Stock, or (iii) if a conversion is made in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition or Fundamental Change, in each case in accordance with the terms hereof.

Holders shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5.
Liquidation.
     (b) If the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference plus any dividends which have been declared but not yet paid to all Holders and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the Holders and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled.
Partial Payment.
     (c) If the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which all Holders and all holders of any Parity Stock are entitled have been paid, the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights and preferences.
Residual Distributions.
     (d) For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company.

provided, however

     (a) The Conversion Rate will be subject to adjustment, without duplication, under the following circumstances:
Adjustments.
 
     (i) the issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock, or a subdivision or combination of Common Stock, in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will be made for the issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock that is made in lieu of a quarterly or annual cash dividend or distribution to such holders, to the extent such dividend or distribution does not exceed the applicable Dividend Threshold Amount. The amount of any such dividend or distribution will equal the number of such shares being issued multiplied by the average of the VWAP of the Common Stock over each of the five consecutive Trading Days prior to the Ex-date for such dividend or distribution.
     (ii) the issuance to all holders of Common Stock of certain rights or warrants entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price as of the Record Date, in which event each Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
     However, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the extent that any such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration.
     (iii) the dividend or other distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of capital stock of the Company (other than common stock) or evidences of its indebtedness or its assets (excluding any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by clauses (i) or (ii) above or (iv) or (v) below) in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     However, if the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (iii) is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of the Company of, or similar equity interests in, a subsidiary or other business unit of ours, (i.e., a spin-off) that are, or, when issued, will be, traded on a U.S. securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, then the Conversion Rate will instead be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
     (iv) the Company makes a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of Common Stock, excluding (a) any cash dividend on Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of Common Stock does not exceed (i) $0.32 in any fiscal quarter in the case of a quarterly dividend or (ii) $1.28 in the prior twelve months in the case of an annual dividend (each such number, the ""), (b) any cash that is distributed as part of a distribution referred to in clause (iii) above, and (c) any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any its subsidiaries referred to in clause (v) below, in which event, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
Dividend Threshold Amount
     The dividend threshold amount is subject to adjustment on an inversely proportional basis whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, provided that no adjustment will be made to the dividend threshold amount for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this clause (iv).
     (v) the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries make purchases of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company for Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the "expiration date"), in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
     (b) All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated by the Company to the nearest 1/10,000th of one share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent; provided, however, that any such minor adjustments that are not required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and provided further that any such adjustment of less than one percent that has not been made will be made upon (x) the end of each fiscal year of the Company, (y) the date of any notice of redemption of the Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof or any notice of a Make-Whole Acquisition and (z) any Conversion Date.

assets as described in Section 12.01(a)(iii), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of the rights.

(C) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Convertible Preferred Stock was first issued.
     (iv) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made for a transaction referred to in Section 12.01(a)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) if Holders may participate in the transaction on a basis and with notice that the Board of Directors determines to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice on which holders of Common Stock participate in the transaction.
     (v) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made for a change in the par value or no par value of the Common Stock.
     (vi) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made to the extent that such adjustment would result in the Conversion Price being less than the par value of the Common Stock.
     (vii) Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event of an adjustment pursuant to Section 12.01(a)(iv) or (v), in no event will the conversion rate following such adjustment exceed 1,897.4084, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 12.01(a)(i), (ii) or (iii).
     (d) For purposes of this Section 12, "" means, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of the Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of holders of the Common Stock entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).

Multiple Adjustments.
     (g) The Company may, but shall not be required to, make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by this Section, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reason.

References herein to the "accrual" of dividends refer only to the determination of the amount of such dividend and do not imply that any right to a dividend arises prior to the date on which a dividend is declared.
Non-Cumulative Dividends.
     (c) So long as any share of Convertible Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless as to a Dividend Payment Date full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the Dividend Period then ending, the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding Dividend Period that commences on such Dividend Payment Date, declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any of Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than:

However, such shares, upon surrender for

CR
1
= CR
0
x (OS
1
/ OS
0
)
where,
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will be made for the issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock that is made in lieu of a quarterly or annual cash dividend or distribution to such holders, to the extent such dividend or distribution does not exceed the applicable Dividend Threshold Amount.

     (ii) the issuance to all holders of Common Stock of certain rights or warrants entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price as of the Record Date, in which event each Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
CR
1
= CR

CR
1
= CR
0
x SP
0
/ (SP
0
 FMV)
where,
     However, if the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (iii) is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of the Company of, or similar equity interests in, a subsidiary or other business unit of ours, (i.e., a spin-off) that are, or, when issued, will be, traded on a U.S. securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, then the Conversion Rate will instead be adjusted based on the following formula:

+ MP
0
) / MP
0

     (iv) the Company makes a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of Common Stock, excluding (a) any cash dividend on Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of Common Stock does not exceed (i) $0.32 in any fiscal quarter in the case of a quarterly dividend or (ii) $1.28 in the prior twelve months in the case of an annual dividend (each such number, the ""), (b) any cash that is distributed as part of a distribution referred to in clause (iii) above, and (c) any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any its subsidiaries referred to in clause (v) below, in which event, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
Dividend Threshold Amount
CR
1
= CR

x SP
0
/ (SP
0
 C)
where,
     The dividend threshold amount is subject to adjustment on an inversely proportional basis whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, provided that no adjustment will be made to the dividend threshold amount for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this clause (iv).
     (v) the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries make purchases of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company for Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the "expiration date"), in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
CR
1
= CR
0
x
[
(FMV + (SP
1
x OS
1
)
]
/ (SP
1
x OS
0
)
where,
 
     (b) All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated by the Company to the nearest 1/10,000th of one share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share).

     The foregoing restriction, however, will not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid.
     Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Convertible Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of Convertible Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of any Parity Stock (including, in the case of any such Parity Stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other.
     Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends payable in cash, stock or otherwise, as may be determined by the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof, may be declared and paid on any Junior Stock and Parity Stock from time to time out of any assets legally available for such payment, and Holders will not be entitled to participate in those dividends.
     (e) If a Conversion Date for any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock is prior to the close of business on a Dividend Record Date for any declared dividend for the then-current Dividend Period, the Holder of such shares will not be entitled to any such dividend. If the Conversion Date for any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock is after the close of business on a Dividend Record Date for any declared dividend for the then-current Dividend Period, but prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, the Holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive such dividend, notwithstanding the conversion of such shares prior to the Dividend Payment Date. However, such shares, upon surrender for
Conversion Following A Record Date.
 
conversion, must be accompanied by funds equal to the dividend on such shares; provided that no such payment need be made (i) if the Company has issued a notice of redemption of the Convertible Preferred Stock, (ii) if the Company has issued a notice of conversion at its option of the Convertible Preferred Stock, or (iii) if a conversion is made in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition or Fundamental Change, in each case in accordance with the terms hereof.
Section 5. Liquidation Rights.
     (a) In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, Holders shall be entitled, out of assets legally available therefor, before any distribution or payment out of the assets of the Company may be made to or set aside for the holders of any Junior Stock and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of securities ranking senior to or on parity with Convertible Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of the Company's depositors and other creditors, to receive in full a liquidating distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of $50,000 per share, plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last dividend payment date to, but excluding, the date of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up if and to the extent declared. Holders shall not be entitled to any further payments in the event of any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company other than what is expressly provided for in this Section 5.
Liquidation.
     (b) If the assets of the Company are not sufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference plus any dividends which have been declared but not yet paid to all Holders and all holders of any Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the Holders and to the holders of all Parity Stock shall be pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be entitled.
Partial Payment.
     (c) If the respective aggregate liquidating distributions to which all Holders and all holders of any Parity Stock are entitled have been paid, the holders of Junior Stock shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Company according to their respective rights and preferences.
Residual Distributions.
     (d) For purposes of this Section 5, the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company shall not be deemed a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, nor shall the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of the Company into or with any other corporation or person or the merger, consolidation or any other business combination transaction of any other corporation or person into or with the Company be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company.

Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Section 6(b) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Convertible Preferred Stock. Each notice shall state:
Notice of Redemption.

     (c) In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata from the Holders in proportion to the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by such Holders, by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof may

determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time.
     (d) If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Company, separate and apart from its other assets, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, or deposited by the Company with a bank or trust company selected by the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof (the "") in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of the shares called for redemption, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date all shares so called for redemption shall cease to be outstanding, all dividends with respect to such shares shall cease to accrue on such redemption date, and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from the Trust at any time after the redemption date from the funds so deposited, without interest. The Company shall be entitled to receive, from time to time, from the Trust any interest accrued on such funds, and the Holders of any shares called for redemption shall have no claim to any such interest. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released or repaid to the Company, and in the event of such repayment to the Company, the Holders of the shares so called for redemption shall be deemed to be unsecured creditors of the Company for an amount equivalent to the amount deposited as stated above for the redemption of such shares and so repaid to the Company, but shall in no event be entitled to any interest.

     (e) If the Convertible Preferred Stock has been called for redemption, a holder will be entitled to convert the Convertible Preferred Stock from the date of notice of the redemption until the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the date of redemption.
Conversion Prior to Redemption.
     (f) If the Company exercises its optional redemption right with respect to some or all of the series of the Concurrent Securities, then the Company will select among the various series with respect to which it will exercise its redemption right on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors of the Company, the Preferred Stock Committee or any duly authorized committee thereof may determine to be fair and equitable.

     (a) The Conversion Rate will be subject to adjustment, without duplication, under the following circumstances:
Adjustments.
 
     (i) the issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock, or a subdivision or combination of Common Stock, in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
     
CR
1
= CR
0
x (OS
1
/ OS
0
)
            where,
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will be made for the issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to all holders of Common Stock that is made in lieu of a quarterly or annual cash dividend or distribution to such holders, to the extent such dividend or distribution does not exceed the applicable Dividend Threshold Amount. The amount of any such dividend or distribution will equal the number of such shares being issued multiplied by the average of the VWAP of the Common Stock over each of the five consecutive Trading Days prior to the Ex-date for such dividend or distribution.
     (ii) the issuance to all holders of Common Stock of certain rights or warrants entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price as of the Record Date, in which event each Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
            
CR
1
= CR
0
x (OS
0
+ X) / (OS
0
+ Y)
            where,
 
     However, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the extent that any such rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration.
     (iii) the dividend or other distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of capital stock of the Company (other than common stock) or evidences of its indebtedness or its assets (excluding any dividend, distribution or issuance covered by clauses (i) or (ii) above or (iv) or (v) below) in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
            
CR
1
= CR
0
x SP
0
/ (SP

 FMV)
            where,
          However, if the transaction that gives rise to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (iii) is one pursuant to which the payment of a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock consists of shares of capital stock of the Company of, or similar equity interests in, a subsidiary or other business unit of ours, (i.e., a spin-off) that are, or, when issued, will be, traded on a U.S. securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, then the Conversion Rate will instead be adjusted based on the following formula:
            
CR

= CR
0
x (FMV

            where,
 
     (iv) the Company makes a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of Common Stock, excluding (a) any cash dividend on Common Stock to the extent that the aggregate cash dividend per share of Common Stock does not exceed (i) $0.32 in any fiscal quarter in the case of a quarterly dividend or (ii) $1.28 in the prior twelve months in the case of an annual dividend (each such number, the ""), (b) any cash that is distributed as part of a distribution referred to in clause (iii) above, and (c) any consideration payable in connection with a tender or exchange offer made by the Company or any its subsidiaries referred to in clause (v) below, in which event, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:

            where,
     The dividend threshold amount is subject to adjustment on an inversely proportional basis whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted, provided that no adjustment will be made to the dividend threshold amount for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this clause (iv).
     (v) the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries make purchases of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by the Company or a subsidiary of the Company for Common Stock to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the VWAP per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (the "expiration date"), in which event the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:

     (b) All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated by the Company to the nearest 1/10,000th of one share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent; provided, however, that any such minor adjustments that are not required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and provided further that any such adjustment of less than one percent that has not been made will be made upon (x) the end of each fiscal year of the Company, (y) the date of any notice of redemption of the Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof or any notice of a Make-Whole Acquisition and (z) any Conversion Date.
Calculation of Adjustments.
     (c) 
When No Adjustment Required.
     (i) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 12, the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted for the issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock or carrying the right to purchase any of the foregoing or for the repurchase of Common Stock.
     (ii) No adjustment of the Conversion Rate need be made as a result of: (A) the issuance of the rights; (B) the distribution of separate certificates representing the rights; (C) the exercise or redemption of the rights in accordance with any rights agreement; or (D) the termination or invalidation of the rights, in each case, pursuant to the Company's stockholder rights plan existing on the date of hereof, as amended, modified, or supplemented from time to time, or any newly adopted stockholder rights plans; provided, however, that to the extent that the Company has a stockholder rights plan in effect on a Conversion Date (including the Company's rights plan, if any, existing on the date hereof), the Holder shall receive, in addition to the shares of Common Stock, the rights under such rights plan, unless, prior to any such Conversion Date, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company made a distribution to all holders of Common Stock of shares of capital stock of the Company or evidences of its indebtedness or its

        (ii) the issuance to all holders of Common Stock of certain rights or warrants entitling them for a period expiring 60 days or less from the date of issuance of such rights or warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) at less than (or having a conversion price per share less than) the Current Market Price as of the Record Date, in which event each Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:

     (b) All adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be calculated by the Company to the nearest 1/10,000th of one share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment to
Calculation of Adjustments.
 
the Conversion Rate will be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent; , , that any such minor adjustments that are not required to be made will be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and provided further that any such adjustment of less than one percent that has not been made will be made upon (x) the end of each fiscal year of the Company, (y) the date of any notice of redemption of the Convertible Preferred Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof or any notice of a Make-Whole Acquisition and (z) any Conversion Date.

     (vi) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made to the extent that such adjustment would result in the Conversion Price being less than the par value of the Common Stock.
     (vii) Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event of an adjustment pursuant to Section 12.01(a)(iv) or (v), in no event will the conversion rate following such adjustment exceed 1,897.4084, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 12.01(a)(i), (ii) or (iii).

Multiple Adjustments.
     (g) The Company may, but shall not be required to, make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by this Section, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reason.

Preferred Stock Director
     (ii) The election of the Preferred Stock Directors will take place at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of the Holders and any other class or series of stock of the Company that ranks on parity with Convertible Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and having equivalent voting rights and for which dividends have not been paid, called as provided herein. At any time after the special voting power has vested pursuant to Section 14(b)(i) above, the secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request of the Holders of at least 20% of the Convertible Preferred Stock or the holders of at least 20% of such other series (addressed to the secretary at the Company's principal office) must (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), call a special meeting of the Holders and any other class or series of preferred stock that ranks on parity with Convertible Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and having equivalent voting rights and for which dividends have not been paid for the election of the two directors to be elected by them as provided in Section 14(b)(iii) below.

days after receipt of any such request, then any Holder may (at the expense of the Company) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section 14(b)(iii), and for that purpose will have access to the stock register of the Company.  The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section 14(b)(iv).  In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by the vote of the Holders (together with holders of any other class of the Company's authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders.

The terms of office of the Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate, and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors will be reduced accordingly. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock (together with holders of any other class of the Company's authorized preferred stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such preferred stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described in this Section 14(b).

     (b) If the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock Committee or any other duly authorized committee thereof does not declare a dividend on the Series AA Preferred Stock for any Dividend Period prior to the related Dividend Payment Date, that dividend will not accrue, and the Company will have no obligation to pay, and Holders shall have no right to receive, a dividend for that Dividend Period on the related Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series AA Preferred Stock or any other series of preferred stock or common stock are declared for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to Series AA Preferred Stock, Parity Stock, Junior Stock or any other class or series of authorized preferred stock of the Company. References herein to the "accrual" of dividends refer only to the determination of the amount of such dividend and do not imply that any right to a dividend arises prior to the date on which a dividend is declared.
Non-Cumulative Dividends.
     (c) So long as any share of Series AA Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless as to a Dividend Payment Date full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series AA Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the Dividend Period then ending, the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding Dividend Period that commences on such Dividend Payment Date, declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than:

     The foregoing restriction, however, will not apply to any Junior Stock dividends paid by the Company where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid.
     Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series AA Preferred Stock remains outstanding, if dividends are not declared and paid in full upon the shares of Series AA Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of Series AA Preferred Stock and any Parity Stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of Series AA Preferred Stock and accrued dividends for the then-current Dividend Period per share of any Parity Stock (including, in the case of any such Parity Stock that bears cumulative dividends, all accrued and unpaid dividends) bear to each other.

Pending the preparation of definitive Receipts, the Depositary, upon, and pursuant to, the written order of the Company delivered in
 
compliance with Section 2.02 shall be authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver temporary Receipts which shall be substantially of the tenor of the definitive Receipts in lieu of which they are issued and in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the persons executing such Receipts may determine (but which do not affect the rights or duties of the Depositary), as evidenced by their execution of such Receipts. If temporary Receipts are issued, the Company and the Depositary will cause definitive Receipts to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Receipts, the temporary Receipts shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts upon surrender of the temporary Receipts at the Depositary Office without charge to the holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Receipts, the Depositary is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver in exchange therefor definitive Receipts representing the same number of Depositary Shares as represented by the surrendered temporary Receipt or Receipts. Such exchange shall be made at the Company's expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Receipts shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Deposit Agreement, and with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited, as definitive Receipts.

No Receipt shall be entitled to any benefits under this Deposit Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless it shall have been executed as provided in the preceding sentence. The Depositary shall record on its books each Receipt executed as provided above and delivered as hereinafter provided. Receipts bearing the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Depositary who was at any time a proper signatory of the Depositary shall bind the Depositary, notwithstanding that such signatory ceased to hold such office prior to the execution and delivery of such Receipts by the Registrar or did not hold such office on the date of issuance of such Receipts.

the contrary, treat the record holder thereof at such time as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of determining the person entitled to distributions of dividends or other distributions or payments with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock, to exercise any redemption, voting, or conversion rights or to receive any notice provided for in this Deposit Agreement and for all other purposes.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request by the Company, the Depositary and the Company will make application to DTC for acceptance of all or a portion of the Receipts for its book-entry settlement system. In connection with any such request, the Company hereby appoints the Depositary acting through any authorized officer thereof as its attorney-in-fact, with full power to delegate, for purposes of executing any agreements, certifications or other instruments or documents necessary or desirable in order to effect the acceptance of such Receipts for DTC eligibility. So long as the Receipts are eligible for book-entry settlement with DTC, unless otherwise required by law, all Depositary Shares to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange with book-entry settlement through DTC shall be represented by a single receipt (the "DTC Receipt"), which shall be deposited with DTC (or its custodian) evidencing all such Depositary Shares and registered in the name of the nominee of DTC (initially expected to be Cede & Co.). The Depositary or such other entity as is agreed to by DTC may hold the DTC Receipt as custodian for DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in the DTC Receipt shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected through, records maintained by (i) DTC or its nominee for such DTC Receipt, or (ii) institutions that have accounts with DTC.
     If issued, the DTC Receipt shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts only if (i) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue to make its book-entry settlement system available for the Receipts and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing, (ii) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under applicable law and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing or (iii) the Company executes and delivers to DTC a notice to the effect that such DTC Receipt shall be so exchangeable. If the beneficial owners of interests in Depositary Shares are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Receipts as the result of an event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such beneficial interests may be so exchanged, the Depositary is hereby directed to and shall provide written instructions to DTC to deliver to the Depositary for cancellation the DTC Receipt, and the Company shall instruct the Depositary in writing to execute and deliver to the beneficial owners of the Depositary Shares previously evidenced by the DTC Receipt definitive Receipts in physical form evidencing such Depositary Shares. The DTC Receipt shall be in such form and shall bear such legend or legends as may be appropriate or required by DTC in order for it to accept the Depositary Shares for its book-entry settlement system. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, if the Receipts are at any time eligible for book-entry settlement through DTC, delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and other property in connection with the withdrawal, redemption or conversion of Depositary Shares will be made through DTC and in accordance with its procedures, unless the holder of the relevant Receipt otherwise requests and such request is reasonably acceptable to the Depositary and the Company.

The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder and The Bank of New York hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, will reflect changes in the number of shares (including any fractional shares) of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock held by it by notation, book-entry or other appropriate method.
     If required by the Depositary, Convertible Preferred Stock presented for deposit by the Company at any time, whether or not the register of stockholders of the Company is closed, shall also be accompanied by an agreement or assignment, or other instrument satisfactory to the Depositary, that will provide for the prompt transfer to the Depositary or its nominee of any dividend or right to subscribe for additional Convertible Preferred Stock or to receive other property that any person in whose name the Convertible Preferred Stock is or has been registered may thereafter receive upon or in respect of such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or in lieu thereof such agreement of indemnity or other agreement as shall be satisfactory to the Depositary.
     Upon receipt by the Depositary of a certificate or certificates for Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder, together with the other documents specified above, and upon registering such Convertible Preferred Stock in the name of the Depositary, the Depositary, subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, shall execute and deliver to, or upon the order of, the person or persons named in the written order delivered to the Depositary referred to in the first paragraph of this Section 2.02, a Receipt or Receipts for the number of whole Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock so deposited and registered in such name or names as may be requested by such person or persons. The Depositary shall execute and deliver such Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of any person requesting such delivery, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such person. Other than in the case of splits, combinations or other reclassifications affecting the Convertible Preferred Stock, or in the case of dividends or other distributions of Convertible Preferred Stock, if any, there shall be deposited hereunder not more than the number of shares constituting the Convertible Preferred Stock as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, as such may be amended. To the extent that the Company issues shares of Convertible Preferred Stock in excess of the amount set forth in the Certificate of Designation as of the date hereof
 
(which shares have been validly authorized by the Company), the Company shall notify the Depositary of such issuance in writing.
     The Company shall deliver to the Depositary from time to time such quantities of Receipts as the Depositary may request to enable the Depositary to perform its obligations under this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 2.03
Optional Redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock for Cash.
     Whenever the Company shall elect to redeem shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock for cash in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, it shall (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Depositary) give the Depositary not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior written notice of the date fixed for redemption of such Convertible Preferred Stock (the "redemption date") and of the number of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by the Depositary to be redeemed and the applicable redemption price (the "redemption price"), as set forth in the Certificate of Designation. The Depositary shall mail, first-class postage prepaid, notice of the redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock and the proposed simultaneous redemption of the Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to the holders of record on the record date fixed for such redemption pursuant to Section 4.04 of the Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed, at the addresses of such holders as the same appear on the records of the Depositary; but neither the failure to mail any such notice to one or more such holder nor any defect in any such notice shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for redemption except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given.
     The Company shall prepare and provide the Depositary with such notice, and each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be redeemed; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed; (v) the place or places where the Convertible Preferred Stock and the Receipts evidencing Depositary Shares to be redeemed are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (vi) that on the redemption date dividends in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue.
     In the event that notice of redemption has been made as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs and the Company shall then have paid in full to the Depositary the redemption price (determined pursuant to the Certificate of Designation) of the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary to be redeemed, the Depositary shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Convertible Preferred Stock so called for redemption by the Company and on the redemption date (unless the Company shall have failed to pay for the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed by it as set forth in the Company's notice provided for in the preceding paragraph), all dividends in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock called for redemption shall cease to accrue, the Depositary Shares called for redemption shall be deemed no longer to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (except the right to receive the redemption price) shall, to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate. Upon surrender in accordance
 
with said notice of the Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Depositary shall so require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed at a cash redemption price of $50 per Depositary Share plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the redemption date. The foregoing shall be further subject to the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Deposit Agreement and the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, the provisions of the Certificate of Designation will govern and the Company will instruct the Depositary in writing accordingly of such governing terms; , , that under no circumstances will the Certificate of Designation be deemed to change or modify any of the rights, duties or immunities of the Depositary contained herein.
provided
however
     If fewer than all of the Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt are called for redemption, the Depositary will deliver to the holder of such Receipt upon its surrender to the Depositary, together with payment of the redemption price for and all other amounts payable in respect of the Depositary Shares called for redemption, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares evidenced by such prior Receipt and not called for redemption.
     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemed pursuant to the Company's exercise of its optional redemption right, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be redeemed pursuant to this Section 2.03 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable.
     SECTION 2.04
Registration of Transfers of Receipts.
     The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Receipts and The Bank of New York hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, shall register on its books from time to time transfers of Receipts upon any surrender thereof by the holder in person or by a duly authorized attorney, agent or representative properly endorsed or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement, together with evidence of the payment by the applicable party of any transfer taxes as may be required by law.

Shares by surrendering such Receipt or Receipts to the Depositary or at such other office as the Depositary may designate for such withdrawals; , that a holder of a Receipt or Receipts may not withdraw such Convertible Preferred Stock (or money and other property, if any, represented thereby) which has previously been called for redemption. Upon such surrender, upon payment of the fee of the Depositary for the surrender of Receipts to the extent provided in Section 5.07 and payment of all taxes and governmental charges in connection with such surrender and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, without unreasonable delay, the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, or to the person or persons designated by such holder as hereinafter provided, the number of whole shares of such Convertible Preferred Stock and all such money and other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipt or Receipts so surrendered for withdrawal, but holders of such whole shares of Convertible Preferred Stock will not thereafter be entitled to deposit such Convertible Preferred Stock hereunder or to receive Depositary Shares therefor. If the Receipt or Receipts delivered by the holder to the Depositary in connection with such withdrawal shall evidence a number of Depositary Shares in excess of the number of Depositary Shares representing the number of whole shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock to be withdrawn, the Depositary shall at the same time, in addition to such number of whole shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and such money and other property, if any, to be withdrawn, deliver to such holder, or (subject to Section 2.04) upon his order, a new Receipt or Receipts evidencing such excess number of Depositary Shares. Delivery of such Convertible Preferred Stock and such money and other property being withdrawn may be made by the delivery of such certificates, documents of title and other instruments as the Depositary may deem appropriate, which, if required by the Depositary, shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer.
provided
     If the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and the money and other property being withdrawn are to be delivered to a person or persons other than the record holder of the Receipt or Receipts being surrendered for withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock, such holder shall execute and deliver to the Depositary a written order so directing the Depositary and the Depositary may require that the Receipt or Receipts surrendered by such holder for withdrawal of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock be properly endorsed in blank or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement in blank.
     The Depositary shall deliver the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and the money and other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by Receipts surrendered for withdrawal at the Depositary Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of the holder surrendering such Receipt or Receipts and for the account of the holder thereof, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such holder.

Limitations on Execution and Delivery, Transfer, Split-up. Combination, Surrender and Exchange of Receipts.

thereto (including any such tax or charge with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock being deposited or withdrawn); (ii) the production of proof satisfactory to it as to the identity and genuineness of any signature (or the authority of any signature); and (iii) compliance with such regulations, if any, as the Depositary or the Company may establish consistent with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement as may be required by any securities exchange on which the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts may be included for quotation or listed.

Conversion at the Option of Holders.
     Subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement and the Certificate of Designation, Receipts may be surrendered at any time by the holders thereof with written instructions to the Depositary instructing it to convert any specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipts into shares of Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock) in accordance with the Certificate of Designation. Depositary shares may be converted at the option of the holders only in lots of 1,000 Depositary Shares or integral multiples thereof.
     On the date of any conversion at the option of the holders, a holder of a Receipt shall surrender such Receipt at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly
 
completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipt to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent, thereby instructing the Depositary to cause the conversion of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt specified in such notice of conversion into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on a Dividend Record Date for any declared dividend for the then-current Dividend Period, but prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date or any holder of Receipts surrendered with instructions to the Depositary for conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipts an amount of funds equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date
 
computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
     In the event that optional conversion is elected by a holder of a surrendered Receipt with respect to less than all Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.10 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     SECTION 2.11

On or before the twentieth day prior to the date on which the Company anticipates consummating the Make-Whole Acquisition (or, if later, promptly after the Company discovers that the Make-Whole Acquisition will occur), a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Depositary, such notice to be prepared by the Company and sent to the Depositary, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of Receipts containing the same information as is contained in the notice received by the Depositary from the Company.
     On the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date, another written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Company, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Depositary, which notice shall contain (i) the date that shall be 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date; (ii) the number of Make-Whole Shares and, if such Make-Whole Acquisition is a Fundamental Change, the Base Price; (iii) the amount of cash, securities and other consideration payable per share of Common Stock and Convertible Preferred Stock (and Depositary Share); and (iv) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise its conversion option in connection with such Make-Whole Acquisition or, if applicable, Fundamental Change.

Acquisition Effective Date, another written notice also shall be sent by or on behalf of the Depositary, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of Receipts. Such notice shall be prepared by the Company and sent to the Depositary and shall contain: (i) the date that shall be 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date; (ii) the number of Make-Whole Shares and, if such Make-Whole Acquisition is a Fundamental Change, the Base Price; (iii) the amount of cash, securities and other consideration payable per share of Common Stock and Convertible Preferred Stock (and Depositary Share); and (iv) the instructions a holder of Depositary Shares must follow to exercise the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion or, if applicable, the Fundamental Change conversion right of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such holder's Depositary Shares.
     To exercise such Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option, a holder must, no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on or before the date by which the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option must be exercised as specified in the notice described in the preceding paragraph, surrender such holder's Receipts at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipts to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent, thereby instructing the Depositary to cause the conversion of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipts specified in such notice of conversion into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition or a Fundamental Change, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of
 
Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company (or cash in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 10(c) of the Certificate of Designation) and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date with respect to any dividend payment on the Convertible Preferred Stock and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, any holder of Receipts surrendered with instructions to the Depositary for conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipts an amount of funds equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
     In the event that Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion or, if applicable, a Fundamental Change conversion is elected by a holder with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.11 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     SECTION 2.12
Conversion at the Option of the Company.
     In connection with any conversion at the option of the Company in accordance with the Certificate of Designation, the Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) to the Depositary stating that it has complied with all of the conditions to the exercise of its optional conversion rights set forth in the Certificate of
 
Designation, and the Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to inquire or investigate whether the Company has complied with the terms of the Certificate of Designation.
     If the Company exercises such conversion right, it shall provide written notice of such conversion to the Depositary stating, in addition to any information required by applicable law or regulation, (i) the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock; and (iii) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted; (iv) if fewer than all shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be converted, the number of such shares held by such holder to be so converted; (v) the place or places where the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted are to be surrendered for conversion.
     Upon receipt of such notice, the Depositary shall as promptly as practicable provide notice of the Company's exercise of such conversion right to each holder of Receipts, which notice shall be prepared by the Company and sent to the Depositary and shall state (i) the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock (and Depositary Share); (iii) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be converted; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be converted, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so converted; (v) the place or places where the Depositary Shares to be converted are to be surrendered for conversion.
     On the date of any conversion at the option of the Company, a holder of a Receipt must surrender such Receipt at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipt to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt in connection with a conversion at the option of the Company, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
 
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) subject to the next succeeding sentence, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     In the event that conversion at the option of the Company is effected with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.12 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is converted pursuant to a conversion at the option of the Company, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be converted pursuant to this Section 2.12 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable. If the Conversion Agent selects a portion of a holder's Depositary Shares for partial conversion at the option of the Company and the holder converts a portion of the same share of Depositary Shares, the converted portion will be deemed to be from the portion selected for conversion.
     SECTION 2.13
Fractional Shares.
     No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued to a holder of the Depositary Shares upon conversion. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable, the holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock, calculated on an aggregate basis in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted, multiplied by the Closing Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) of the Common Stock on the trading day (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) immediately preceding the applicable conversion date, which shall be paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether the amounts of funds paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion are correct.
 
     SECTION 2.14
No Pre-Release
     The Depositary shall not deliver any deposited Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by Receipts prior to the receipt and cancellation of such Receipts or other similar method used with respect to Receipts held by DTC. The Depositary shall not issue any Receipts prior to the receipt by the Depositary of the corresponding Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by such Receipts. At no time will any Receipts be outstanding if such Receipts do not represent Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary.
     SECTION 3.01
Filing Proofs, Certificates and Other Information.
     Any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file with the Depositary such proof of residence, guarantee of signature or other information and to execute such certificates as the Depositary may reasonably deem necessary or proper or the Company may reasonably require by written request to the Depositary. The Depositary or the Company may withhold or delay the delivery of any Receipt, the transfer, redemption or exchange of any Receipt, the withdrawal of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by any Receipt, the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof, until such proof or other information is filed, or such certificates are executed.
     SECTION 3.02
Payment of Fees and Expenses.
     Holders of Receipts shall be obligated to make payments to the Depositary of certain fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges to the extent provided in Section 5.07, or provide evidence satisfactory to the Depositary that such fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges have been paid. Until such payment is made, transfer of any Receipt or any withdrawal of the Convertible Preferred Stock or money or other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be refused, any dividend or other distribution may be withheld, and any part or all of the Convertible Preferred Stock or other property represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be sold for the account of the holder thereof (after attempting by reasonable means to notify such holder a reasonable number of days prior to such sale). Any dividend or other distribution so withheld and the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such fees or expenses, the holder of such Receipt remaining liable for any deficiency.
     SECTION 3.03
Representations and Warranties as to Convertible Preferred Stock.
     In the case of the initial deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock hereunder, the Company represents and warrants that such Convertible Preferred Stock and each certificate therefor are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Such representations and warranties shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts.
 
     SECTION 3.04
Representation and Warranty as to Receipts and Depositary Shares.
     The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will evidence legal and valid interests in the Depositary Shares and each Depositary Share will represent a legal and valid 1/1,000 fractional interest in a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Share. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares.
th
     SECTION 3.05
Taxes.
     The Company will pay any and all stock transfer, documentary, stamp and similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of Depositary Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Depositary Shares or certificates representing such shares or securities. The Company will not, however, be required to pay any such tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, shares of Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in which the Depositary Shares with respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment to any person other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and will not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
     SECTION 4.01
Cash Distributions.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, including any cash received upon redemption of any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.03, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of such sum as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders; , , that in case the Company or the Depositary shall be required by law to and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Receipts held by any holder an amount on account of taxes or as otherwise required by law, regulation or court process, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares represented by such Receipts subject to such withholding shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary, however, shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Receipts a fraction of one cent. Any such fractional amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent and so distributed to registered holders entitled thereto and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for
provided
however
 
interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next succeeding distribution to record holders of such Receipts. Each holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with a properly completed Form W-8 (i.e., Form W-8BEN, Form W-8EXP, Form W-8IMY, Form W8ECI or another applicable Form W-8) or Form W-9 (which form shall set forth such holder's certified taxpayer identification number if requested on such form), as may be applicable. Each holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distribution to be made hereunder.
     SECTION 4.02
Distributions Other Than Cash.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Depositary and the Company may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of securities to the holders of Receipts unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such securities have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
     SECTION 4.03
Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
     If the Company shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names deposited Convertible Preferred Stock is registered on the books of the Company any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts in such manner as the Company shall instruct (including by the issue to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges); , , that (a) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Company determines upon advice of its legal counsel that it is not lawful or feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to the holders of Receipts (by the issue of warrants or otherwise) or (b) if and to the extent instructed by holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, the Depositary shall then, if so directed by the Company and provided with an opinion of counsel that if Depositary undertakes such actions it will not be deemed an "issuer" under the Securities Act or an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges so permit, sell such rights, preferences or privileges of such holders at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Section 3.01 and Section 3.02, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.01 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of such rights, preferences or privileges, unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such rights, preferences or privileges have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
provided

     If registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement that it will promptly file a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such a registration statement shall have become effective or unless the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act and the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to such effect.
     If any other action under the law of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
     The Depositary will not be deemed to have any knowledge of any item for which it is supposed to receive notification under any Section of this Deposit Agreement unless and until it has received such notification.
     SECTION 4.04
Notice of Dividends; Fixing of Record Date for Holders of Receipts.
     Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable, any distribution other than cash shall be made, or any rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of (i) any meeting at which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to notice or (ii) any election on the part of the Company to redeem any shares of such Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting or to receive notice of such meeting or whose Depositary Shares are to be so redeemed.
     SECTION 4.05
Voting Rights.
     Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice, which shall be provided by the Company and which
 
shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting, (ii) a statement that the holders of Receipts at the close of business on a specified record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 will be entitled, subject to any applicable provision of law, to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares and (iii) a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of a holder of a Receipt on such record date, the Depositary shall insofar as practicable vote or cause to be voted the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request. To the extent any such instructions request the voting of a fractional interest of a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall aggregate such interest with all other fractional interests resulting from requests with the same voting instructions and shall vote the number of whole votes resulting from such aggregation in accordance with the instructions received in such requests. Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote and, accordingly, each Depositary Share is entitled to 1/1000 of a vote. The Company hereby agrees to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Convertible Preferred Stock or cause such Convertible Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will vote all Depositary Shares held by it in proportion with any instructions received. The Depositary shall not exercise any discretion in voting any Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.

     SECTION 4.06
Changes Affecting Convertible Preferred Stock and Reorganization Events.
     Upon any change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Convertible Preferred Stock, any Reorganization Event or any exchange of the Convertible Preferred Stock for cash, securities or other property, the Depositary shall, upon the written instructions of the Company setting forth any of the following adjustments, (i) reflect such adjustments in the Depositary's books and records in (a) the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Convertible Preferred Stock and (b) the ratio of the redemption price and the conversion rate per Depositary Share to the redemption price and the conversion rate, respectively, of a share of Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case as may be required by or as is consistent with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation to fully reflect the effects of such change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Convertible Preferred Stock, of such Reorganization Event or of such exchange and (ii) treat any shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) that shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock as new deposited property under this Deposit Agreement, and Receipts then outstanding shall thenceforth represent the proportionate interests of holders thereof in the new deposited property so received in exchange for or in respect of such Convertible Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may, upon the receipt of written request of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts, or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited property.
 
     SECTION 4.07
Inspection of Reports.
     The Depositary shall make available for inspection by holders of Receipts at the Depositary Office and at such other places as it may from time to time deem advisable during normal business hours any reports and communications received from the Company that are both received by the Depositary as the holder of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and made generally available to the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Depositary shall transmit, upon written request by the Company, certain notices and reports to the holders of Receipts as provided in Section 5.05.
     SECTION 4.08
Lists of Receipt Holders.
     Promptly upon request from time to time by the Company, the Registrar shall furnish to the Company a list, as of a recent date specified by the Company, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary Shares of all persons in whose names Receipts are registered on the books of the Registrar.
     SECTION 4.09
Withholding.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Deposit Agreement, in the event that the Depositary determines that any distribution in property is subject to any tax or other governmental charge which the Depositary is obligated by law to withhold, the Depositary may dispose of, by public or private sale, all or a portion of such property in such amounts and in such manner as the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay such taxes, and the Depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of any such sale or the balance of any such property after deduction of such taxes to the holders of Receipts entitled thereto in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares held by them, respectively; , , that in the event the Depositary determines that such distribution of property is subject to withholding tax only with respect to some but not all holders of Receipts, the Depositary will use its best efforts (i) to sell only that portion of such property distributable to such holders that is required to generate sufficient proceeds to pay such withholding tax and (ii) to effect any such sale in such a manner so as to avoid affecting the rights of any other holders of Receipts to receive such distribution in property.

     SECTION 5.01
Maintenance of Offices, Agencies and Transfer Books by the Depositary and the Registrar.
     The Depositary shall maintain at the Depositary Office facilities for the execution and delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange, split-up, combination and redemption of Receipts and deposit and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock and at the offices of the Depositary's Agents, if any, facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange, split-up, combination and redemption of Receipts and deposit and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock, all in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement.
 
     The Registrar shall keep books at the Depositary Office for the registration and transfer of Receipts, which books at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the record holders of Receipts as provided by applicable law. The Company may cause the Registrar to close such books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.
     If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or any other stock exchange, the Depositary may, with the written approval of the Company, appoint a registrar (acceptable to the Company) for registration of such Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with the requirements of such exchange. Such registrar (which may be the Registrar if so permitted by the requirements of such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar appointed by the Registrar upon the request or with the written approval of the Company. If the Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock are listed on one or more other stock exchanges, the Registrar will, at the request and expense of the Company, arrange such facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender, redemption and exchange of such Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock as may be required by law or applicable stock exchange regulations.
     SECTION 5.02
Prevention or Delay in Performance by the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar or the Company.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar, any Transfer Agent, or the Company shall incur any liability to any holder of any Receipt, if by reason of any provision of any present or future law or regulation thereunder of the United States of America or of any other governmental authority or, in the case of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or the Registrar or Transfer Agent, by reason of any provision, present or future, of the Certificate of Incorporation or, in the case of the Company, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar, by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party, the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Company shall be prevented or forbidden from doing or performing any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall be done or performed; nor shall the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, any Registrar or the Company incur any liability to any holder of a Receipt by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall or may be done or performed, or by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 5.03
Obligations of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar and the Company.
     The Company does not assume any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement or any Receipt to holders of Receipts other than from acts or omissions arising out of conduct constituting bad faith, negligence (in the case of any action or inaction with respect to the voting of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock), gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement. Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or
 
Registrar assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to holders of Receipts, the Company or any other person or entity other than for its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Depositary, nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, lost profits, even if such person or entity alleged to be liable has knowledge of the possibility of such damages. Any liability of the Depositary and any Registrar or Transfer Agent under this Deposit Agreement will be limited to the amount of annual fees paid by the Company to the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares or Receipts that in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability, unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information provided by any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent and the Company may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
     In the event the Depositary shall receive conflicting claims, requests or instructions from any holders of Receipts, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, the Depositary shall be entitled to act on such claims, requests or instructions received from the Company, and shall incur no liability and shall be entitled to the full indemnification set forth in Section 5.06 in connection with any action so taken.
     The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action does not result from bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Depositary (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). The Depositary undertakes, and any Registrar or Transfer Agent shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
     The Depositary, its parent, affiliate, or subsidiaries, any Depositary's Agent, and any Registrar or Transfer Agent may own, buy, sell or deal in any class of securities of the Company and its affiliates and in Receipts or Depositary Shares or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company or its affiliates may be interested or contract with or lend money to or otherwise act as fully or as freely as if it were not the Depositary or the Depositary's Agent
 
hereunder. The Depositary may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Company and its affiliates or act in any other capacity for the Company or its affiliates.
     It is intended that neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent shall be deemed to be an "issuer" of the securities under the federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Depositary and any Depositary's Agent are acting only in a ministerial capacity as Depositary for the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock; , , that the Depositary agrees to comply with all information reporting and withholding requirements applicable to it under law or this Deposit Agreement in its capacity as Depositary.
provided

     Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively provided and established by a certificate signed by any one of the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasuer, Head of Corporate Finance, the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar; and such certificate shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar and the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent,
 
Transfer Agent or Registrar shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Deposit Agreement in reliance upon such certificate. The Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Deposit Agreement or in the Receipts (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
     The Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar will not be under any duty or responsibility to ensure compliance with any applicable federal or state securities laws in connection with the issuance, transfer or exchange of the Receipts, Stock or Depositary Shares.
     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment to the Certificate of Designation shall affect the rights, duties, obligations or immunities of the Depositary, Transfer Agent, the Depositary's Agent or Registrar hereunder.
     The Depositary, Transfer Agent and any Registrar hereunder:
          (i) shall have no duties or obligations other than those specifically set forth herein (and no implied duties or obligations), or as may subsequently be agreed to in writing by the parties;
          (ii) shall have no obligation to make payment hereunder unless the Company shall have provided the necessary federal or other immediately available funds or securities or property, as the case may be, to pay in full amounts due and payable with respect thereto;
          (iii) shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder; if, however, the Depositary determines to take any legal or other action hereunder, and, where the taking of such action might in the Depositary's judgment subject or expose it to any expense or liability, the Depositary shall not be required to act unless it shall have been furnished with an indemnity satisfactory to it;
          (iv) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon any certificate, instrument, opinion, notice, letter, facsimile transmission or other document or security delivered to the Depositary and believed by the Depositary to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper party or parties, and shall have no responsibility for determining the accuracy thereof;
          (v) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon the written, telephonic, electronic and oral instructions, with respect to any matter relating to the Depositary's actions as depositary covered by this Deposit Agreement (or supplementing or qualifying any such actions) of officers of the Company;
          (vi) may consult counsel satisfactory to it, and the advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by the Depositary hereunder in accordance with the advice of such counsel;
 
          (vii) shall not be called upon at any time to advise any person with respect to the Depositary Shares or Receipts;
          (viii) shall not be liable or responsible for any recital or statement contained in any documents relating hereto or the Depositary Shares or Receipts; and
          (ix) shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties (other than with respect to the Depositary) executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Deposit Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for under this Deposit Agreement.

     The Depositary may at any time be removed by the Company by notice of such removal delivered to the Depositary, such removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided. Upon any such removal or appointment, the Company shall send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of Receipts.
     In case at any time the Depositary acting hereunder shall resign or be removed, the Company shall, within 60 days after the delivery of the notice of resignation or removal, as the case may be, appoint a successor depositary, which shall be an entity having its principal office in the United States of America and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If a successor depositary shall not have been appointed and have accepted appointment in 60 days, the resigning Depositary may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor depositary. Every successor depositary shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Company an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor depositary, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Company, shall promptly execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all rights, title and interest in the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and any moneys or property held hereunder to such successor and shall deliver to such successor a list of the record holders of all outstanding Receipts.

execution or filing of any document or any further act. Such successor depositary may execute the Receipts either in the name of the predecessor depositary or in the name of the successor depositary.

     The form of the Receipts and any provision of this Deposit Agreement may at any time and from time to time be amended by agreement between the Company and the Depositary without the consent of holders of Receipts in any respect that the Company and the Depositary may deem necessary or desirable; , , that no such amendment (other than any change in the fees of any Depositary, Registrar or Transfer Agent that are payable by the Company) which (i) shall materially and adversely alter the rights of the holders of Receipts or (ii) would be materially and adversely inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation shall be effective unless such amendment shall have been approved by the holders of Receipts evidencing at least two-thirds of the Depositary Shares then outstanding. In no event shall any amendment impair the right, subject to the provisions of Section 2.06 and Section 2.07 and Article III, of any holder of any Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares to surrender any Receipt with instructions to the Depositary to deliver to the holder the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented thereby, except in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law.

Pending the preparation of definitive Receipts, the Depositary, upon, and pursuant to, the written order of the Company delivered in
 
compliance with Section 2.02 shall be authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver temporary Receipts which shall be substantially of the tenor of the definitive Receipts in lieu of which they are issued and in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the persons executing such Receipts may determine (but which do not affect the rights or duties of the Depositary), as evidenced by their execution of such Receipts. If temporary Receipts are issued, the Company and the Depositary will cause definitive Receipts to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Receipts, the temporary Receipts shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts upon surrender of the temporary Receipts at the Depositary Office without charge to the holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Receipts, the Depositary is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver in exchange therefor definitive Receipts representing the same number of Depositary Shares as represented by the surrendered temporary Receipt or Receipts. Such exchange shall be made at the Company's expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Receipts shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Deposit Agreement, and with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited, as definitive Receipts.

No Receipt shall be entitled to any benefits under this Deposit Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless it shall have been executed as provided in the preceding sentence. The Depositary shall record on its books each Receipt executed as provided above and delivered as hereinafter provided. Receipts bearing the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Depositary who was at any time a proper signatory of the Depositary shall bind the Depositary, notwithstanding that such signatory ceased to hold such office prior to the execution and delivery of such Receipts by the Registrar or did not hold such office on the date of issuance of such Receipts.
provided
     Receipts shall be in denominations of any number of whole Depositary Shares. All Receipts shall be dated the date of their issuance.
     Receipts may be endorsed with or have incorporated in the text thereof such legends or recitals or changes not inconsistent with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement as may be required by the Depositary and approved by the Company, or which the Company has determined are required to comply with any applicable law or regulation or with the rules and regulations of any securities exchange upon which the Depositary Shares may be listed for trading or to conform with any usage with respect thereto, or to indicate any special limitations or restrictions to which any particular Receipts are subject, in each case as directed by the Company.

provided
however
 
the contrary, treat the record holder thereof at such time as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of determining the person entitled to distributions of dividends or other distributions or payments with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock, to exercise any redemption, voting, or conversion rights or to receive any notice provided for in this Deposit Agreement and for all other purposes.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request by the Company, the Depositary and the Company will make application to DTC for acceptance of all or a portion of the Receipts for its book-entry settlement system. In connection with any such request, the Company hereby appoints the Depositary acting through any authorized officer thereof as its attorney-in-fact, with full power to delegate, for purposes of executing any agreements, certifications or other instruments or documents necessary or desirable in order to effect the acceptance of such Receipts for DTC eligibility. So long as the Receipts are eligible for book-entry settlement with DTC, unless otherwise required by law, all Depositary Shares to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange with book-entry settlement through DTC shall be represented by a single receipt (the "DTC Receipt"), which shall be deposited with DTC (or its custodian) evidencing all such Depositary Shares and registered in the name of the nominee of DTC (initially expected to be Cede & Co.). The Depositary or such other entity as is agreed to by DTC may hold the DTC Receipt as custodian for DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in the DTC Receipt shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected through, records maintained by (i) DTC or its nominee for such DTC Receipt, or (ii) institutions that have accounts with DTC.
     If issued, the DTC Receipt shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts only if (i) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue to make its book-entry settlement system available for the Receipts and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing, (ii) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under applicable law and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing or (iii) the Company executes and delivers to DTC a notice to the effect that such DTC Receipt shall be so exchangeable. If the beneficial owners of interests in Depositary Shares are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Receipts as the result of an event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such beneficial interests may be so exchanged, the Depositary is hereby directed to and shall provide written instructions to DTC to deliver to the Depositary for cancellation the DTC Receipt, and the Company shall instruct the Depositary in writing to execute and deliver to the beneficial owners of the Depositary Shares previously evidenced by the DTC Receipt definitive Receipts in physical form evidencing such Depositary Shares. The DTC Receipt shall be in such form and shall bear such legend or legends as may be appropriate or required by DTC in order for it to accept the Depositary Shares for its book-entry settlement system. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, if the Receipts are at any time eligible for book-entry settlement through DTC, delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and other property in connection with the withdrawal, redemption or conversion of Depositary Shares will be made through DTC and in accordance with its procedures, unless the holder of the relevant Receipt otherwise requests and such request is reasonably acceptable to the Depositary and the Company.

The Depositary acknowledges receipt of the aforementioned 60,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and related documentation and agrees to hold such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock in an account to be established by the Depositary at the Depositary Office or at such other office as the Depositary shall determine. The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder and The Bank of New York hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, will reflect changes in the number of shares (including any fractional shares) of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock held by it by notation, book-entry or other appropriate method.
     If required by the Depositary, Convertible Preferred Stock presented for deposit by the Company at any time, whether or not the register of stockholders of the Company is closed, shall also be accompanied by an agreement or assignment, or other instrument satisfactory to the Depositary, that will provide for the prompt transfer to the Depositary or its nominee of any dividend or right to subscribe for additional Convertible Preferred Stock or to receive other property that any person in whose name the Convertible Preferred Stock is or has been registered may thereafter receive upon or in respect of such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or in lieu thereof such agreement of indemnity or other agreement as shall be satisfactory to the Depositary.
     Upon receipt by the Depositary of a certificate or certificates for Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder, together with the other documents specified above, and upon registering such Convertible Preferred Stock in the name of the Depositary, the Depositary, subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, shall execute and deliver to, or upon the order of, the person or persons named in the written order delivered to the Depositary referred to in the first paragraph of this Section 2.02, a Receipt or Receipts for the number of whole Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock so deposited and registered in such name or names as may be requested by such person or persons. The Depositary shall execute and deliver such Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of any person requesting such delivery, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such person. Other than in the case of splits, combinations or other reclassifications affecting the Convertible Preferred Stock, or in the case of dividends or other distributions of Convertible Preferred Stock, if any, there shall be deposited hereunder not more than the number of shares constituting the Convertible Preferred Stock as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, as such may be amended. To the extent that the Company issues shares of Convertible Preferred Stock in excess of the amount set forth in the Certificate of Designation as of the date hereof
 
(which shares have been validly authorized by the Company), the Company shall notify the Depositary of such issuance in writing.
     The Company shall deliver to the Depositary from time to time such quantities of Receipts as the Depositary may request to enable the Depositary to perform its obligations under this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 2.03
Optional Redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock for Cash.
     Whenever the Company shall elect to redeem shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock for cash in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, it shall (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Depositary) give the Depositary not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior written notice of the date fixed for redemption of such Convertible Preferred Stock (the "redemption date") and of the number of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by the Depositary to be redeemed and the applicable redemption price (the "redemption price"), as set forth in the Certificate of Designation. The Depositary shall mail, first-class postage prepaid, notice of the redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock and the proposed simultaneous redemption of the Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to the holders of record on the record date fixed for such redemption pursuant to Section 4.04 of the Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed, at the addresses of such holders as the same appear on the records of the Depositary; but neither the failure to mail any such notice to one or more such holder nor any defect in any such notice shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for redemption except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given.
     The Company shall prepare and provide the Depositary with such notice, and each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be redeemed; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed; (v) the place or places where the Convertible Preferred Stock and the Receipts evidencing Depositary Shares to be redeemed are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (vi) that on the redemption date dividends in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue.
     In the event that notice of redemption has been made as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs and the Company shall then have paid in full to the Depositary the redemption price (determined pursuant to the Certificate of Designation) of the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary to be redeemed, the Depositary shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Convertible Preferred Stock so called for redemption by the Company and on the redemption date (unless the Company shall have failed to pay for the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed by it as set forth in the Company's notice provided for in the preceding paragraph), all dividends in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock called for redemption shall cease to accrue, the Depositary Shares called for redemption shall be deemed no longer to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (except the right to receive the redemption price) shall, to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate. Upon surrender in accordance
 
with said notice of the Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Depositary shall so require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed at a cash redemption price of $50 per Depositary Share plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the redemption date. The foregoing shall be further subject to the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Deposit Agreement and the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, the provisions of the Certificate of Designation will govern and the Company will instruct the Depositary in writing accordingly of such governing terms; , , that under no circumstances will the Certificate of Designation be deemed to change or modify any of the rights, duties or immunities of the Depositary contained herein.
provided
however
     If fewer than all of the Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt are called for redemption, the Depositary will deliver to the holder of such Receipt upon its surrender to the Depositary, together with payment of the redemption price for and all other amounts payable in respect of the Depositary Shares called for redemption, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares evidenced by such prior Receipt and not called for redemption.
     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemed pursuant to the Company's exercise of its optional redemption right, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be redeemed pursuant to this Section 2.03 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable.
     SECTION 2.04
Registration of Transfers of Receipts.
     The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Receipts and The Bank of New York hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, shall register on its books from time to time transfers of Receipts upon any surrender thereof by the holder in person or by a duly authorized attorney, agent or representative properly endorsed or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement, together with evidence of the payment by the applicable party of any transfer taxes as may be required by law.

     SECTION 2.05
Combinations and Split-ups of Receipts.
     Upon surrender of a Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may designate for the purpose of effecting a split-up or combination of Receipts, subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary shall execute and deliver a new Receipt or Receipts in the authorized denominations requested evidencing the same aggregate number of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipt or Receipts surrendered.
     SECTION 2.06

Shares by surrendering such Receipt or Receipts to the Depositary or at such other office as the Depositary may designate for such withdrawals; , that a holder of a Receipt or Receipts may not withdraw such Convertible Preferred Stock (or money and other property, if any, represented thereby) which has previously been called for redemption. Upon such surrender, upon payment of the fee of the Depositary for the surrender of Receipts to the extent provided in Section 5.07 and payment of all taxes and governmental charges in connection with such surrender and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, without unreasonable delay, the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, or to the person or persons designated by such holder as hereinafter provided, the number of whole shares of such Convertible Preferred Stock and all such money and other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipt or Receipts so surrendered for withdrawal, but holders of such whole shares of Convertible Preferred Stock will not thereafter be entitled to deposit such Convertible Preferred Stock hereunder or to receive Depositary Shares therefor. If the Receipt or Receipts delivered by the holder to the Depositary in connection with such withdrawal shall evidence a number of Depositary Shares in excess of the number of Depositary Shares representing the number of whole shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock to be withdrawn, the Depositary shall at the same time, in addition to such number of whole shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and such money and other property, if any, to be withdrawn, deliver to such holder, or (subject to Section 2.04) upon his order, a new Receipt or Receipts evidencing such excess number of Depositary Shares. Delivery of such Convertible Preferred Stock and such money and other property being withdrawn may be made by the delivery of such certificates, documents of title and other instruments as the Depositary may deem appropriate, which, if required by the Depositary, shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer.
provided
     If the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and the money and other property being withdrawn are to be delivered to a person or persons other than the record holder of the Receipt or Receipts being surrendered for withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock, such holder shall execute and deliver to the Depositary a written order so directing the Depositary and the Depositary may require that the Receipt or Receipts surrendered by such holder for withdrawal of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock be properly endorsed in blank or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement in blank.
     The Depositary shall deliver the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and the money and other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by Receipts surrendered for withdrawal at the Depositary Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of the holder surrendering such Receipt or Receipts and for the account of the holder thereof, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such holder.
     SECTION 2.07
Limitations on Execution and Delivery, Transfer, Split-up. Combination, Surrender and Exchange of Receipts.

     Subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement and the Certificate of Designation, Receipts may be surrendered at any time by the holders thereof with written instructions to the Depositary instructing it to convert any specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipts into shares of Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock) in accordance with the Certificate of Designation. Depositary shares may be converted at the option of the holders only in lots of 1,000 Depositary Shares or integral multiples thereof.
     On the date of any conversion at the option of the holders, a holder of a Receipt shall surrender such Receipt at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly
 
completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipt to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent, thereby instructing the Depositary to cause the conversion of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt specified in such notice of conversion into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on a Dividend Record Date for any declared dividend for the then-current Dividend Period, but prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date or any holder of Receipts surrendered with instructions to the Depositary for conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipts an amount of funds equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date
 
computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
     In the event that optional conversion is elected by a holder of a surrendered Receipt with respect to less than all Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.10 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     SECTION 2.11

Acquisition Effective Date, another written notice also shall be sent by or on behalf of the Depositary, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of Receipts. Such notice shall be prepared by the Company and sent to the Depositary and shall contain: (i) the date that shall be 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date; (ii) the number of Make-Whole Shares and, if such Make-Whole Acquisition is a Fundamental Change, the Base Price; (iii) the amount of cash, securities and other consideration payable per share of Common Stock and Convertible Preferred Stock (and Depositary Share); and (iv) the instructions a holder of Depositary Shares must follow to exercise the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion or, if applicable, the Fundamental Change conversion right of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such holder's Depositary Shares.
     To exercise such Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option, a holder must, no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on or before the date by which the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option must be exercised as specified in the notice described in the preceding paragraph, surrender such holder's Receipts at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipts to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent, thereby instructing the Depositary to cause the conversion of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipts specified in such notice of conversion into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition or a Fundamental Change, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of
 
Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company (or cash in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 10(c) of the Certificate of Designation) and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date with respect to any dividend payment on the Convertible Preferred Stock and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, any holder of Receipts surrendered with instructions to the Depositary for conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipts an amount of funds equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
     In the event that Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion or, if applicable, a Fundamental Change conversion is elected by a holder with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.11 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     SECTION 2.12
Conversion at the Option of the Company.
     In connection with any conversion at the option of the Company in accordance with the Certificate of Designation, the Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) to the Depositary stating that it has complied with all of the conditions to the exercise of its optional conversion rights set forth in the Certificate of
 
Designation, and the Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to inquire or investigate whether the Company has complied with the terms of the Certificate of Designation.
     If the Company exercises such conversion right, it shall provide written notice of such conversion to the Depositary stating, in addition to any information required by applicable law or regulation, (i) the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock; and (iii) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted; (iv) if fewer than all shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be converted, the number of such shares held by such holder to be so converted; (v) the place or places where the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted are to be surrendered for conversion.
     Upon receipt of such notice, the Depositary shall as promptly as practicable provide notice of the Company's exercise of such conversion right to each holder of Receipts, which notice shall be prepared by the Company and sent to the Depositary and shall state (i) the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock (and Depositary Share); (iii) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be converted; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be converted, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so converted; (v) the place or places where the Depositary Shares to be converted are to be surrendered for conversion.
     On the date of any conversion at the option of the Company, a holder of a Receipt must surrender such Receipt at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipt to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt in connection with a conversion at the option of the Company, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
 
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) subject to the next succeeding sentence, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     In the event that conversion at the option of the Company is effected with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.12 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is converted pursuant to a conversion at the option of the Company, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be converted pursuant to this Section 2.12 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable. If the Conversion Agent selects a portion of a holder's Depositary Shares for partial conversion at the option of the Company and the holder converts a portion of the same share of Depositary Shares, the converted portion will be deemed to be from the portion selected for conversion.
     SECTION 2.13
Fractional Shares.
     No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued to a holder of the Depositary Shares upon conversion. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable, the holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock, calculated on an aggregate basis in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted, multiplied by the Closing Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) of the Common Stock on the trading day (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) immediately preceding the applicable conversion date, which shall be paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether the amounts of funds paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion are correct.
 
     SECTION 2.14
No Pre-Release
     The Depositary shall not deliver any deposited Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by Receipts prior to the receipt and cancellation of such Receipts or other similar method used with respect to Receipts held by DTC.

At no time will any Receipts be outstanding if such Receipts do not represent Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary.
     SECTION 3.01
Filing Proofs, Certificates and Other Information.
     Any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file with the Depositary such proof of residence, guarantee of signature or other information and to execute such certificates as the Depositary may reasonably deem necessary or proper or the Company may reasonably require by written request to the Depositary. The Depositary or the Company may withhold or delay the delivery of any Receipt, the transfer, redemption or exchange of any Receipt, the withdrawal of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by any Receipt, the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof, until such proof or other information is filed, or such certificates are executed.
     SECTION 3.02
Payment of Fees and Expenses.
     Holders of Receipts shall be obligated to make payments to the Depositary of certain fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges to the extent provided in Section 5.07, or provide evidence satisfactory to the Depositary that such fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges have been paid. Until such payment is made, transfer of any Receipt or any withdrawal of the Convertible Preferred Stock or money or other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be refused, any dividend or other distribution may be withheld, and any part or all of the Convertible Preferred Stock or other property represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be sold for the account of the holder thereof (after attempting by reasonable means to notify such holder a reasonable number of days prior to such sale). Any dividend or other distribution so withheld and the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such fees or expenses, the holder of such Receipt remaining liable for any deficiency.
     SECTION 3.03
Representations and Warranties as to Convertible Preferred Stock.
     In the case of the initial deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock hereunder, the Company represents and warrants that such Convertible Preferred Stock and each certificate therefor are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Such representations and warranties shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts.
 
     SECTION 3.04
Representation and Warranty as to Receipts and Depositary Shares.
     The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will evidence legal and valid interests in the Depositary Shares and each Depositary Share will represent a legal and valid 1/1,000 fractional interest in a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Share. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares.
th
     SECTION 3.05
Taxes.
     The Company will pay any and all stock transfer, documentary, stamp and similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of Depositary Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Depositary Shares or certificates representing such shares or securities. The Company will not, however, be required to pay any such tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, shares of Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in which the Depositary Shares with respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment to any person other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and will not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
     SECTION 4.01
Cash Distributions.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, including any cash received upon redemption of any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.03, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of such sum as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders; , , that in case the Company or the Depositary shall be required by law to and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Receipts held by any holder an amount on account of taxes or as otherwise required by law, regulation or court process, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares represented by such Receipts subject to such withholding shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary, however, shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Receipts a fraction of one cent. Any such fractional amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent and so distributed to registered holders entitled thereto and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for
provided
however
 
interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next succeeding distribution to record holders of such Receipts. Each holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with a properly completed Form W-8 (i.e., Form W-8BEN, Form W-8EXP, Form W-8IMY, Form W8ECI or another applicable Form W-8) or Form W-9 (which form shall set forth such holder's certified taxpayer identification number if requested on such form), as may be applicable. Each holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distribution to be made hereunder.
     SECTION 4.02
Distributions Other Than Cash.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Depositary and the Company may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of securities to the holders of Receipts unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such securities have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
     SECTION 4.03
Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
     If the Company shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names deposited Convertible Preferred Stock is registered on the books of the Company any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts in such manner as the Company shall instruct (including by the issue to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges); , , that (a) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Company determines upon advice of its legal counsel that it is not lawful or feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to the holders of Receipts (by the issue of warrants or otherwise) or (b) if and to the extent instructed by holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, the Depositary shall then, if so directed by the Company and provided with an opinion of counsel that if Depositary undertakes such actions it will not be deemed an "issuer" under the Securities Act or an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges so permit, sell such rights, preferences or privileges of such holders at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Section 3.01 and Section 3.02, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.01 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of such rights, preferences or privileges, unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such rights, preferences or privileges have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
provided
however
 
     If registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement that it will promptly file a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such a registration statement shall have become effective or unless the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act and the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to such effect.
     If any other action under the law of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
     The Depositary will not be deemed to have any knowledge of any item for which it is supposed to receive notification under any Section of this Deposit Agreement unless and until it has received such notification.
     SECTION 4.04
Notice of Dividends; Fixing of Record Date for Holders of Receipts.
     Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable, any distribution other than cash shall be made, or any rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of (i) any meeting at which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to notice or (ii) any election on the part of the Company to redeem any shares of such Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting or to receive notice of such meeting or whose Depositary Shares are to be so redeemed.
     SECTION 4.05
Voting Rights.
     Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice, which shall be provided by the Company and which
 
shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting, (ii) a statement that the holders of Receipts at the close of business on a specified record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 will be entitled, subject to any applicable provision of law, to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares and (iii) a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of a holder of a Receipt on such record date, the Depositary shall insofar as practicable vote or cause to be voted the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request. To the extent any such instructions request the voting of a fractional interest of a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall aggregate such interest with all other fractional interests resulting from requests with the same voting instructions and shall vote the number of whole votes resulting from such aggregation in accordance with the instructions received in such requests. Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote and, accordingly, each Depositary Share is entitled to 1/1000 of a vote. The Company hereby agrees to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Convertible Preferred Stock or cause such Convertible Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will vote all Depositary Shares held by it in proportion with any instructions received. The Depositary shall not exercise any discretion in voting any Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.

Changes Affecting Convertible Preferred Stock and Reorganization Events.
     Upon any change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Convertible Preferred Stock, any Reorganization Event or any exchange of the Convertible Preferred Stock for cash, securities or other property, the Depositary shall, upon the written instructions of the Company setting forth any of the following adjustments, (i) reflect such adjustments in the Depositary's books and records in (a) the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Convertible Preferred Stock and (b) the ratio of the redemption price and the conversion rate per Depositary Share to the redemption price and the conversion rate, respectively, of a share of Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case as may be required by or as is consistent with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation to fully reflect the effects of such change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Convertible Preferred Stock, of such Reorganization Event or of such exchange and (ii) treat any shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) that shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock as new deposited property under this Deposit Agreement, and Receipts then outstanding shall thenceforth represent the proportionate interests of holders thereof in the new deposited property so received in exchange for or in respect of such Convertible Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may, upon the receipt of written request of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts, or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited property.

     SECTION 4.09
Withholding.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Deposit Agreement, in the event that the Depositary determines that any distribution in property is subject to any tax or other governmental charge which the Depositary is obligated by law to withhold, the Depositary may dispose of, by public or private sale, all or a portion of such property in such amounts and in such manner as the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay such taxes, and the Depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of any such sale or the balance of any such property after deduction of such taxes to the holders of Receipts entitled thereto in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares held by them, respectively; , , that in the event the Depositary determines that such distribution of property is subject to withholding tax only with respect to some but not all holders of Receipts, the Depositary will use its best efforts (i) to sell only that portion of such property distributable to such holders that is required to generate sufficient proceeds to pay such withholding tax and (ii) to effect any such sale in such a manner so as to avoid affecting the rights of any other holders of Receipts to receive such distribution in property.

     SECTION 5.01
Maintenance of Offices, Agencies and Transfer Books by the Depositary and the Registrar.

The Company may cause the Registrar to close such books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.
     If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or any other stock exchange, the Depositary may, with the written approval of the Company, appoint a registrar (acceptable to the Company) for registration of such Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with the requirements of such exchange. Such registrar (which may be the Registrar if so permitted by the requirements of such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar appointed by the Registrar upon the request or with the written approval of the Company. If the Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock are listed on one or more other stock exchanges, the Registrar will, at the request and expense of the Company, arrange such facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender, redemption and exchange of such Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock as may be required by law or applicable stock exchange regulations.
     SECTION 5.02
Prevention or Delay in Performance by the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar or the Company.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar, any Transfer Agent, or the Company shall incur any liability to any holder of any Receipt, if by reason of any provision of any present or future law or regulation thereunder of the United States of America or of any other governmental authority or, in the case of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or the Registrar or Transfer Agent, by reason of any provision, present or future, of the Certificate of Incorporation or, in the case of the Company, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar, by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party, the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Company shall be prevented or forbidden from doing or performing any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall be done or performed; nor shall the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, any Registrar or the Company incur any liability to any holder of a Receipt by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall or may be done or performed, or by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 5.03
Obligations of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar and the Company.
     The Company does not assume any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement or any Receipt to holders of Receipts other than from acts or omissions arising out of conduct constituting bad faith, negligence (in the case of any action or inaction with respect to the voting of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock), gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement. Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or
 
Registrar assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to holders of Receipts, the Company or any other person or entity other than for its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Depositary, nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, lost profits, even if such person or entity alleged to be liable has knowledge of the possibility of such damages. Any liability of the Depositary and any Registrar or Transfer Agent under this Deposit Agreement will be limited to the amount of annual fees paid by the Company to the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares or Receipts that in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability, unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information provided by any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent and the Company may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
     In the event the Depositary shall receive conflicting claims, requests or instructions from any holders of Receipts, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, the Depositary shall be entitled to act on such claims, requests or instructions received from the Company, and shall incur no liability and shall be entitled to the full indemnification set forth in Section 5.06 in connection with any action so taken.
     The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action does not result from bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Depositary (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). The Depositary undertakes, and any Registrar or Transfer Agent shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
     The Depositary, its parent, affiliate, or subsidiaries, any Depositary's Agent, and any Registrar or Transfer Agent may own, buy, sell or deal in any class of securities of the Company and its affiliates and in Receipts or Depositary Shares or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company or its affiliates may be interested or contract with or lend money to or otherwise act as fully or as freely as if it were not the Depositary or the Depositary's Agent
 
hereunder. The Depositary may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Company and its affiliates or act in any other capacity for the Company or its affiliates.
     It is intended that neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent shall be deemed to be an "issuer" of the securities under the federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Depositary and any Depositary's Agent are acting only in a ministerial capacity as Depositary for the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock; , , that the Depositary agrees to comply with all information reporting and withholding requirements applicable to it under law or this Deposit Agreement in its capacity as Depositary.
provided
however
     Neither the Depositary (or its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates) nor any Depositary's Agent makes any representation or has any responsibility as to the validity of the registration statement pursuant to which the Depositary Shares are registered under the Securities Act, the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares, the Receipts (except its countersignature thereon) or any instruments referred to therein or herein, or as to the correctness of any statement made therein or herein; , , that the Depositary is responsible for its representations in this Deposit Agreement.
provided

     Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively provided and established by a certificate signed by any one of the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasuer, Head of Corporate Finance, the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar; and such certificate shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar and the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent,
 
Transfer Agent or Registrar shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Deposit Agreement in reliance upon such certificate. The Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Deposit Agreement or in the Receipts (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
     The Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar will not be under any duty or responsibility to ensure compliance with any applicable federal or state securities laws in connection with the issuance, transfer or exchange of the Receipts, Stock or Depositary Shares.
     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment to the Certificate of Designation shall affect the rights, duties, obligations or immunities of the Depositary, Transfer Agent, the Depositary's Agent or Registrar hereunder.
     The Depositary, Transfer Agent and any Registrar hereunder:
          (i) shall have no duties or obligations other than those specifically set forth herein (and no implied duties or obligations), or as may subsequently be agreed to in writing by the parties;
          (ii) shall have no obligation to make payment hereunder unless the Company shall have provided the necessary federal or other immediately available funds or securities or property, as the case may be, to pay in full amounts due and payable with respect thereto;
          (iii) shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder; if, however, the Depositary determines to take any legal or other action hereunder, and, where the taking of such action might in the Depositary's judgment subject or expose it to any expense or liability, the Depositary shall not be required to act unless it shall have been furnished with an indemnity satisfactory to it;
          (iv) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon any certificate, instrument, opinion, notice, letter, facsimile transmission or other document or security delivered to the Depositary and believed by the Depositary to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper party or parties, and shall have no responsibility for determining the accuracy thereof;
          (v) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon the written, telephonic, electronic and oral instructions, with respect to any matter relating to the Depositary's actions as depositary covered by this Deposit Agreement (or supplementing or qualifying any such actions) of officers of the Company;
          (vi) may consult counsel satisfactory to it, and the advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by the Depositary hereunder in accordance with the advice of such counsel;
 
          (vii) shall not be called upon at any time to advise any person with respect to the Depositary Shares or Receipts;
          (viii) shall not be liable or responsible for any recital or statement contained in any documents relating hereto or the Depositary Shares or Receipts; and
          (ix) shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties (other than with respect to the Depositary) executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Deposit Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for under this Deposit Agreement.

Upon any such removal or appointment, the Company shall send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of Receipts.
     In case at any time the Depositary acting hereunder shall resign or be removed, the Company shall, within 60 days after the delivery of the notice of resignation or removal, as the case may be, appoint a successor depositary, which shall be an entity having its principal office in the United States of America and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000.

Every successor depositary shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Company an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor depositary, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Company, shall promptly execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all rights, title and interest in the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and any moneys or property held hereunder to such successor and shall deliver to such successor a list of the record holders of all outstanding Receipts.

In no event shall any amendment impair the right, subject to the provisions of Section 2.06 and Section 2.07 and Article III, of any holder of any Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares to surrender any Receipt with instructions to the Depositary to deliver to the holder the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented thereby, except in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law.

Pending the preparation of definitive Receipts, the Depositary, upon, and pursuant to, the written order of the Company delivered in
 
compliance with Section 2.02 shall be authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver temporary Receipts which shall be substantially of the tenor of the definitive Receipts in lieu of which they are issued and in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the persons executing such Receipts may determine (but which do not affect the rights or duties of the Depositary), as evidenced by their execution of such Receipts. If temporary Receipts are issued, the Company and the Depositary will cause definitive Receipts to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Receipts, the temporary Receipts shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts upon surrender of the temporary Receipts at the Depositary Office without charge to the holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Receipts, the Depositary is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver in exchange therefor definitive Receipts representing the same number of Depositary Shares as represented by the surrendered temporary Receipt or Receipts. Such exchange shall be made at the Company's expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Receipts shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Deposit Agreement, and with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited, as definitive Receipts.

No Receipt shall be entitled to any benefits under this Deposit Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless it shall have been executed as provided in the preceding sentence. The Depositary shall record on its books each Receipt executed as provided above and delivered as hereinafter provided. Receipts bearing the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Depositary who was at any time a proper signatory of the Depositary shall bind the Depositary, notwithstanding that such signatory ceased to hold such office prior to the execution and delivery of such Receipts by the Registrar or did not hold such office on the date of issuance of such Receipts.
provided
     Receipts shall be in denominations of any number of whole Depositary Shares. All Receipts shall be dated the date of their issuance.

provided
however
 
the contrary, treat the record holder thereof at such time as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of determining the person entitled to distributions of dividends or other distributions or payments with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock, to exercise any redemption, voting, or conversion rights or to receive any notice provided for in this Deposit Agreement and for all other purposes.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request by the Company, the Depositary and the Company will make application to DTC for acceptance of all or a portion of the Receipts for its book-entry settlement system. In connection with any such request, the Company hereby appoints the Depositary acting through any authorized officer thereof as its attorney-in-fact, with full power to delegate, for purposes of executing any agreements, certifications or other instruments or documents necessary or desirable in order to effect the acceptance of such Receipts for DTC eligibility. So long as the Receipts are eligible for book-entry settlement with DTC, unless otherwise required by law, all Depositary Shares to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange with book-entry settlement through DTC shall be represented by a single receipt (the "DTC Receipt"), which shall be deposited with DTC (or its custodian) evidencing all such Depositary Shares and registered in the name of the nominee of DTC (initially expected to be Cede & Co.). The Depositary or such other entity as is agreed to by DTC may hold the DTC Receipt as custodian for DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in the DTC Receipt shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected through, records maintained by (i) DTC or its nominee for such DTC Receipt, or (ii) institutions that have accounts with DTC.
     If issued, the DTC Receipt shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts only if (i) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue to make its book-entry settlement system available for the Receipts and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing, (ii) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under applicable law and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing or (iii) the Company executes and delivers to DTC a notice to the effect that such DTC Receipt shall be so exchangeable. If the beneficial owners of interests in Depositary Shares are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Receipts as the result of an event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such beneficial interests may be so exchanged, the Depositary is hereby directed to and shall provide written instructions to DTC to deliver to the Depositary for cancellation the DTC Receipt, and the Company shall instruct the Depositary in writing to execute and deliver to the beneficial owners of the Depositary Shares previously evidenced by the DTC Receipt definitive Receipts in physical form evidencing such Depositary Shares. The DTC Receipt shall be in such form and shall bear such legend or legends as may be appropriate or required by DTC in order for it to accept the Depositary Shares for its book-entry settlement system. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, if the Receipts are at any time eligible for book-entry settlement through DTC, delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and other property in connection with the withdrawal, redemption or conversion of Depositary Shares will be made through DTC and in accordance with its procedures, unless the holder of the relevant Receipt otherwise requests and such request is reasonably acceptable to the Depositary and the Company.

The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder and The Bank of New York hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, will reflect changes in the number of shares (including any fractional shares) of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock held by it by notation, book-entry or other appropriate method.
     If required by the Depositary, Convertible Preferred Stock presented for deposit by the Company at any time, whether or not the register of stockholders of the Company is closed, shall also be accompanied by an agreement or assignment, or other instrument satisfactory to the Depositary, that will provide for the prompt transfer to the Depositary or its nominee of any dividend or right to subscribe for additional Convertible Preferred Stock or to receive other property that any person in whose name the Convertible Preferred Stock is or has been registered may thereafter receive upon or in respect of such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or in lieu thereof such agreement of indemnity or other agreement as shall be satisfactory to the Depositary.
     Upon receipt by the Depositary of a certificate or certificates for Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder, together with the other documents specified above, and upon registering such Convertible Preferred Stock in the name of the Depositary, the Depositary, subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, shall execute and deliver to, or upon the order of, the person or persons named in the written order delivered to the Depositary referred to in the first paragraph of this Section 2.02, a Receipt or Receipts for the number of whole Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock so deposited and registered in such name or names as may be requested by such person or persons. The Depositary shall execute and deliver such Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of any person requesting such delivery, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such person. Other than in the case of splits, combinations or other reclassifications affecting the Convertible Preferred Stock, or in the case of dividends or other distributions of Convertible Preferred Stock, if any, there shall be deposited hereunder not more than the number of shares constituting the Convertible Preferred Stock as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, as such may be amended. To the extent that the Company issues shares of Convertible Preferred Stock in excess of the amount set forth in the Certificate of Designation as of the date hereof
 
(which shares have been validly authorized by the Company), the Company shall notify the Depositary of such issuance in writing.
     The Company shall deliver to the Depositary from time to time such quantities of Receipts as the Depositary may request to enable the Depositary to perform its obligations under this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 2.03
Optional Redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock for Cash.
     Whenever the Company shall elect to redeem shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock for cash in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, it shall (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Depositary) give the Depositary not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior written notice of the date fixed for redemption of such Convertible Preferred Stock (the "redemption date") and of the number of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by the Depositary to be redeemed and the applicable redemption price (the "redemption price"), as set forth in the Certificate of Designation. The Depositary shall mail, first-class postage prepaid, notice of the redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock and the proposed simultaneous redemption of the Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to the holders of record on the record date fixed for such redemption pursuant to Section 4.04 of the Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed, at the addresses of such holders as the same appear on the records of the Depositary; but neither the failure to mail any such notice to one or more such holder nor any defect in any such notice shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for redemption except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given.
     The Company shall prepare and provide the Depositary with such notice, and each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be redeemed; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed; (v) the place or places where the Convertible Preferred Stock and the Receipts evidencing Depositary Shares to be redeemed are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (vi) that on the redemption date dividends in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue.
     In the event that notice of redemption has been made as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs and the Company shall then have paid in full to the Depositary the redemption price (determined pursuant to the Certificate of Designation) of the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary to be redeemed, the Depositary shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Convertible Preferred Stock so called for redemption by the Company and on the redemption date (unless the Company shall have failed to pay for the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed by it as set forth in the Company's notice provided for in the preceding paragraph), all dividends in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock called for redemption shall cease to accrue, the Depositary Shares called for redemption shall be deemed no longer to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (except the right to receive the redemption price) shall, to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate. Upon surrender in accordance
 
with said notice of the Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Depositary shall so require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed at a cash redemption price of $50 per Depositary Share plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the redemption date. The foregoing shall be further subject to the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Deposit Agreement and the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, the provisions of the Certificate of Designation will govern and the Company will instruct the Depositary in writing accordingly of such governing terms; , , that under no circumstances will the Certificate of Designation be deemed to change or modify any of the rights, duties or immunities of the Depositary contained herein.
provided
however
     If fewer than all of the Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt are called for redemption, the Depositary will deliver to the holder of such Receipt upon its surrender to the Depositary, together with payment of the redemption price for and all other amounts payable in respect of the Depositary Shares called for redemption, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares evidenced by such prior Receipt and not called for redemption.
     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemed pursuant to the Company's exercise of its optional redemption right, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be redeemed pursuant to this Section 2.03 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable.
     SECTION 2.04
Registration of Transfers of Receipts.
     The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Receipts and The Bank of New York hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, shall register on its books from time to time transfers of Receipts upon any surrender thereof by the holder in person or by a duly authorized attorney, agent or representative properly endorsed or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement, together with evidence of the payment by the applicable party of any transfer taxes as may be required by law.

Shares by surrendering such Receipt or Receipts to the Depositary or at such other office as the Depositary may designate for such withdrawals; , that a holder of a Receipt or Receipts may not withdraw such Convertible Preferred Stock (or money and other property, if any, represented thereby) which has previously been called for redemption.

If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on a Dividend Record Date for any declared dividend for the then-current Dividend Period, but prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date or any holder of Receipts surrendered with instructions to the Depositary for conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipts an amount of funds equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date
 
computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
     In the event that optional conversion is elected by a holder of a surrendered Receipt with respect to less than all Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.10 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     SECTION 2.11
Conversion upon Certain Acquisitions.
     On or before the twentieth day prior to the date on which the Company anticipates consummating a Make-Whole Acquisition (or, if later, promptly after the Company discovers that the Make-Whole Acquisition will occur), a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Company, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Depositary, which notice shall contain (i) the date on which the Make-Whole Acquisition is anticipated to be effected, and whether such Make-Whole Acquisition is anticipated to be a Fundamental Change; and (ii) the date, which shall be 30 days after the anticipated Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date, by which the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option must be exercised. On or before the twentieth day prior to the date on which the Company anticipates consummating the Make-Whole Acquisition (or, if later, promptly after the Company discovers that the Make-Whole Acquisition will occur), a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Depositary, such notice to be prepared by the Company and sent to the Depositary, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of Receipts containing the same information as is contained in the notice received by the Depositary from the Company.
     On the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date, another written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Company, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Depositary, which notice shall contain (i) the date that shall be 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date; (ii) the number of Make-Whole Shares and, if such Make-Whole Acquisition is a Fundamental Change, the Base Price; (iii) the amount of cash, securities and other consideration payable per share of Common Stock and Convertible Preferred Stock (and Depositary Share); and (iv) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise its conversion option in connection with such Make-Whole Acquisition or, if applicable, Fundamental Change. On the Make-Whole
 
Acquisition Effective Date, another written notice also shall be sent by or on behalf of the Depositary, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of Receipts. Such notice shall be prepared by the Company and sent to the Depositary and shall contain: (i) the date that shall be 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date; (ii) the number of Make-Whole Shares and, if such Make-Whole Acquisition is a Fundamental Change, the Base Price; (iii) the amount of cash, securities and other consideration payable per share of Common Stock and Convertible Preferred Stock (and Depositary Share); and (iv) the instructions a holder of Depositary Shares must follow to exercise the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion or, if applicable, the Fundamental Change conversion right of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such holder's Depositary Shares.
     To exercise such Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option, a holder must, no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on or before the date by which the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option must be exercised as specified in the notice described in the preceding paragraph, surrender such holder's Receipts at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipts to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent, thereby instructing the Depositary to cause the conversion of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipts specified in such notice of conversion into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition or a Fundamental Change, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of
 
Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company (or cash in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 10(c) of the Certificate of Designation) and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date with respect to any dividend payment on the Convertible Preferred Stock and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, any holder of Receipts surrendered with instructions to the Depositary for conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipts an amount of funds equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
     In the event that Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion or, if applicable, a Fundamental Change conversion is elected by a holder with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.11 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     SECTION 2.12
Conversion at the Option of the Company.
     In connection with any conversion at the option of the Company in accordance with the Certificate of Designation, the Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) to the Depositary stating that it has complied with all of the conditions to the exercise of its optional conversion rights set forth in the Certificate of
 
Designation, and the Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to inquire or investigate whether the Company has complied with the terms of the Certificate of Designation.
     If the Company exercises such conversion right, it shall provide written notice of such conversion to the Depositary stating, in addition to any information required by applicable law or regulation, (i) the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock; and (iii) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted; (iv) if fewer than all shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be converted, the number of such shares held by such holder to be so converted; (v) the place or places where the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted are to be surrendered for conversion.
     Upon receipt of such notice, the Depositary shall as promptly as practicable provide notice of the Company's exercise of such conversion right to each holder of Receipts, which notice shall be prepared by the Company and sent to the Depositary and shall state (i) the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock (and Depositary Share); (iii) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be converted; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be converted, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so converted; (v) the place or places where the Depositary Shares to be converted are to be surrendered for conversion.
     On the date of any conversion at the option of the Company, a holder of a Receipt must surrender such Receipt at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipt to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt in connection with a conversion at the option of the Company, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
 
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) subject to the next succeeding sentence, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     In the event that conversion at the option of the Company is effected with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.12 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is converted pursuant to a conversion at the option of the Company, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be converted pursuant to this Section 2.12 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable. If the Conversion Agent selects a portion of a holder's Depositary Shares for partial conversion at the option of the Company and the holder converts a portion of the same share of Depositary Shares, the converted portion will be deemed to be from the portion selected for conversion.
     SECTION 2.13
Fractional Shares.
     No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued to a holder of the Depositary Shares upon conversion. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable, the holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock, calculated on an aggregate basis in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted, multiplied by the Closing Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) of the Common Stock on the trading day (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) immediately preceding the applicable conversion date, which shall be paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether the amounts of funds paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion are correct.
 
     SECTION 2.14
No Pre-Release
     The Depositary shall not deliver any deposited Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by Receipts prior to the receipt and cancellation of such Receipts or other similar method used with respect to Receipts held by DTC. The Depositary shall not issue any Receipts prior to the receipt by the Depositary of the corresponding Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by such Receipts. At no time will any Receipts be outstanding if such Receipts do not represent Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary.
     SECTION 3.01
Filing Proofs, Certificates and Other Information.
     Any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file with the Depositary such proof of residence, guarantee of signature or other information and to execute such certificates as the Depositary may reasonably deem necessary or proper or the Company may reasonably require by written request to the Depositary. The Depositary or the Company may withhold or delay the delivery of any Receipt, the transfer, redemption or exchange of any Receipt, the withdrawal of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by any Receipt, the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof, until such proof or other information is filed, or such certificates are executed.
     SECTION 3.02
Payment of Fees and Expenses.
     Holders of Receipts shall be obligated to make payments to the Depositary of certain fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges to the extent provided in Section 5.07, or provide evidence satisfactory to the Depositary that such fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges have been paid. Until such payment is made, transfer of any Receipt or any withdrawal of the Convertible Preferred Stock or money or other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be refused, any dividend or other distribution may be withheld, and any part or all of the Convertible Preferred Stock or other property represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be sold for the account of the holder thereof (after attempting by reasonable means to notify such holder a reasonable number of days prior to such sale). Any dividend or other distribution so withheld and the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such fees or expenses, the holder of such Receipt remaining liable for any deficiency.
     SECTION 3.03
Representations and Warranties as to Convertible Preferred Stock.
     In the case of the initial deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock hereunder, the Company represents and warrants that such Convertible Preferred Stock and each certificate therefor are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Such representations and warranties shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts.
 
     SECTION 3.04
Representation and Warranty as to Receipts and Depositary Shares.
     The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will evidence legal and valid interests in the Depositary Shares and each Depositary Share will represent a legal and valid 1/1,000 fractional interest in a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Share. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares.
th
     SECTION 3.05
Taxes.
     The Company will pay any and all stock transfer, documentary, stamp and similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of Depositary Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Depositary Shares or certificates representing such shares or securities. The Company will not, however, be required to pay any such tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, shares of Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in which the Depositary Shares with respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment to any person other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and will not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
     SECTION 4.01
Cash Distributions.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, including any cash received upon redemption of any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.03, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of such sum as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders; , , that in case the Company or the Depositary shall be required by law to and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Receipts held by any holder an amount on account of taxes or as otherwise required by law, regulation or court process, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares represented by such Receipts subject to such withholding shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary, however, shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Receipts a fraction of one cent. Any such fractional amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent and so distributed to registered holders entitled thereto and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for
provided
however
 
interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next succeeding distribution to record holders of such Receipts. Each holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with a properly completed Form W-8 (i.e., Form W-8BEN, Form W-8EXP, Form W-8IMY, Form W8ECI or another applicable Form W-8) or Form W-9 (which form shall set forth such holder's certified taxpayer identification number if requested on such form), as may be applicable. Each holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distribution to be made hereunder.
     SECTION 4.02
Distributions Other Than Cash.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Depositary and the Company may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of securities to the holders of Receipts unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such securities have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
     SECTION 4.03
Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
     If the Company shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names deposited Convertible Preferred Stock is registered on the books of the Company any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts in such manner as the Company shall instruct (including by the issue to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges); , , that (a) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Company determines upon advice of its legal counsel that it is not lawful or feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to the holders of Receipts (by the issue of warrants or otherwise) or (b) if and to the extent instructed by holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, the Depositary shall then, if so directed by the Company and provided with an opinion of counsel that if Depositary undertakes such actions it will not be deemed an "issuer" under the Securities Act or an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges so permit, sell such rights, preferences or privileges of such holders at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Section 3.01 and Section 3.02, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.01 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of such rights, preferences or privileges, unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such rights, preferences or privileges have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
provided
however
 
     If registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement that it will promptly file a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such a registration statement shall have become effective or unless the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act and the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to such effect.
     If any other action under the law of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
     The Depositary will not be deemed to have any knowledge of any item for which it is supposed to receive notification under any Section of this Deposit Agreement unless and until it has received such notification.
     SECTION 4.04
Notice of Dividends; Fixing of Record Date for Holders of Receipts.
     Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable, any distribution other than cash shall be made, or any rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of (i) any meeting at which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to notice or (ii) any election on the part of the Company to redeem any shares of such Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting or to receive notice of such meeting or whose Depositary Shares are to be so redeemed.
     SECTION 4.05
Voting Rights.
     Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice, which shall be provided by the Company and which
 
shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting, (ii) a statement that the holders of Receipts at the close of business on a specified record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 will be entitled, subject to any applicable provision of law, to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares and (iii) a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of a holder of a Receipt on such record date, the Depositary shall insofar as practicable vote or cause to be voted the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request. To the extent any such instructions request the voting of a fractional interest of a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall aggregate such interest with all other fractional interests resulting from requests with the same voting instructions and shall vote the number of whole votes resulting from such aggregation in accordance with the instructions received in such requests. Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote and, accordingly, each Depositary Share is entitled to 1/1000 of a vote. The Company hereby agrees to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Convertible Preferred Stock or cause such Convertible Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will vote all Depositary Shares held by it in proportion with any instructions received. The Depositary shall not exercise any discretion in voting any Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.
th
     SECTION 4.06
Changes Affecting Convertible Preferred Stock and Reorganization Events.
     Upon any change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Convertible Preferred Stock, any Reorganization Event or any exchange of the Convertible Preferred Stock for cash, securities or other property, the Depositary shall, upon the written instructions of the Company setting forth any of the following adjustments, (i) reflect such adjustments in the Depositary's books and records in (a) the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Convertible Preferred Stock and (b) the ratio of the redemption price and the conversion rate per Depositary Share to the redemption price and the conversion rate, respectively, of a share of Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case as may be required by or as is consistent with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation to fully reflect the effects of such change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Convertible Preferred Stock, of such Reorganization Event or of such exchange and (ii) treat any shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) that shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock as new deposited property under this Deposit Agreement, and Receipts then outstanding shall thenceforth represent the proportionate interests of holders thereof in the new deposited property so received in exchange for or in respect of such Convertible Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may, upon the receipt of written request of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts, or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited property.
 
     SECTION 4.07
Inspection of Reports.
     The Depositary shall make available for inspection by holders of Receipts at the Depositary Office and at such other places as it may from time to time deem advisable during normal business hours any reports and communications received from the Company that are both received by the Depositary as the holder of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and made generally available to the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Depositary shall transmit, upon written request by the Company, certain notices and reports to the holders of Receipts as provided in Section 5.05.
     SECTION 4.08
Lists of Receipt Holders.
     Promptly upon request from time to time by the Company, the Registrar shall furnish to the Company a list, as of a recent date specified by the Company, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary Shares of all persons in whose names Receipts are registered on the books of the Registrar.
     SECTION 4.09
Withholding.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Deposit Agreement, in the event that the Depositary determines that any distribution in property is subject to any tax or other governmental charge which the Depositary is obligated by law to withhold, the Depositary may dispose of, by public or private sale, all or a portion of such property in such amounts and in such manner as the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay such taxes, and the Depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of any such sale or the balance of any such property after deduction of such taxes to the holders of Receipts entitled thereto in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares held by them, respectively; , , that in the event the Depositary determines that such distribution of property is subject to withholding tax only with respect to some but not all holders of Receipts, the Depositary will use its best efforts (i) to sell only that portion of such property distributable to such holders that is required to generate sufficient proceeds to pay such withholding tax and (ii) to effect any such sale in such a manner so as to avoid affecting the rights of any other holders of Receipts to receive such distribution in property.

     If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or any other stock exchange, the Depositary may, with the written approval of the Company, appoint a registrar (acceptable to the Company) for registration of such Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with the requirements of such exchange. Such registrar (which may be the Registrar if so permitted by the requirements of such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar appointed by the Registrar upon the request or with the written approval of the Company.

     SECTION 5.02
Prevention or Delay in Performance by the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar or the Company.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar, any Transfer Agent, or the Company shall incur any liability to any holder of any Receipt, if by reason of any provision of any present or future law or regulation thereunder of the United States of America or of any other governmental authority or, in the case of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or the Registrar or Transfer Agent, by reason of any provision, present or future, of the Certificate of Incorporation or, in the case of the Company, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar, by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party, the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Company shall be prevented or forbidden from doing or performing any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall be done or performed; nor shall the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, any Registrar or the Company incur any liability to any holder of a Receipt by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall or may be done or performed, or by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 5.03
Obligations of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar and the Company.
     The Company does not assume any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement or any Receipt to holders of Receipts other than from acts or omissions arising out of conduct constituting bad faith, negligence (in the case of any action or inaction with respect to the voting of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock), gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement. Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or
 
Registrar assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to holders of Receipts, the Company or any other person or entity other than for its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Depositary, nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, lost profits, even if such person or entity alleged to be liable has knowledge of the possibility of such damages. Any liability of the Depositary and any Registrar or Transfer Agent under this Deposit Agreement will be limited to the amount of annual fees paid by the Company to the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares or Receipts that in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability, unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information provided by any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent and the Company may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
     In the event the Depositary shall receive conflicting claims, requests or instructions from any holders of Receipts, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, the Depositary shall be entitled to act on such claims, requests or instructions received from the Company, and shall incur no liability and shall be entitled to the full indemnification set forth in Section 5.06 in connection with any action so taken.
     The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action does not result from bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Depositary (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). The Depositary undertakes, and any Registrar or Transfer Agent shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
     The Depositary, its parent, affiliate, or subsidiaries, any Depositary's Agent, and any Registrar or Transfer Agent may own, buy, sell or deal in any class of securities of the Company and its affiliates and in Receipts or Depositary Shares or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company or its affiliates may be interested or contract with or lend money to or otherwise act as fully or as freely as if it were not the Depositary or the Depositary's Agent
 
hereunder. The Depositary may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Company and its affiliates or act in any other capacity for the Company or its affiliates.
     It is intended that neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent shall be deemed to be an "issuer" of the securities under the federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Depositary and any Depositary's Agent are acting only in a ministerial capacity as Depositary for the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock; , , that the Depositary agrees to comply with all information reporting and withholding requirements applicable to it under law or this Deposit Agreement in its capacity as Depositary.
provided
however
     Neither the Depositary (or its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates) nor any Depositary's Agent makes any representation or has any responsibility as to the validity of the registration statement pursuant to which the Depositary Shares are registered under the Securities Act, the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares, the Receipts (except its countersignature thereon) or any instruments referred to therein or herein, or as to the correctness of any statement made therein or herein; , , that the Depositary is responsible for its representations in this Deposit Agreement.
provided
however
     The Company agrees that it will register the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and the Depositary Shares in accordance with the applicable securities laws.
     In the event the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or any Registrar or Transfer Agent believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists in any notice, instruction, direction, request or other communication, paper or document received by it pursuant to this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall promptly notify the Company of the details of such alleged ambiguity or uncertainty, and may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any action, and the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be fully protected and shall incur no liability to any person from refraining from taking such action, absent bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction), unless and until (i) the rights of all parties have been fully and finally adjudicated by a court of appropriate jurisdiction or (ii) the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar receives written instructions with respect to such matter signed by the Company that eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar.
     Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively provided and established by a certificate signed by any one of the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasuer, Head of Corporate Finance, the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar; and such certificate shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar and the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent,
 
Transfer Agent or Registrar shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Deposit Agreement in reliance upon such certificate. The Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Deposit Agreement or in the Receipts (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
     The Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar will not be under any duty or responsibility to ensure compliance with any applicable federal or state securities laws in connection with the issuance, transfer or exchange of the Receipts, Stock or Depositary Shares.
     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment to the Certificate of Designation shall affect the rights, duties, obligations or immunities of the Depositary, Transfer Agent, the Depositary's Agent or Registrar hereunder.
     The Depositary, Transfer Agent and any Registrar hereunder:
          (i) shall have no duties or obligations other than those specifically set forth herein (and no implied duties or obligations), or as may subsequently be agreed to in writing by the parties;
          (ii) shall have no obligation to make payment hereunder unless the Company shall have provided the necessary federal or other immediately available funds or securities or property, as the case may be, to pay in full amounts due and payable with respect thereto;
          (iii) shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder; if, however, the Depositary determines to take any legal or other action hereunder, and, where the taking of such action might in the Depositary's judgment subject or expose it to any expense or liability, the Depositary shall not be required to act unless it shall have been furnished with an indemnity satisfactory to it;
          (iv) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon any certificate, instrument, opinion, notice, letter, facsimile transmission or other document or security delivered to the Depositary and believed by the Depositary to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper party or parties, and shall have no responsibility for determining the accuracy thereof;
          (v) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon the written, telephonic, electronic and oral instructions, with respect to any matter relating to the Depositary's actions as depositary covered by this Deposit Agreement (or supplementing or qualifying any such actions) of officers of the Company;
          (vi) may consult counsel satisfactory to it, and the advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by the Depositary hereunder in accordance with the advice of such counsel;
 
          (vii) shall not be called upon at any time to advise any person with respect to the Depositary Shares or Receipts;
          (viii) shall not be liable or responsible for any recital or statement contained in any documents relating hereto or the Depositary Shares or Receipts; and
          (ix) shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties (other than with respect to the Depositary) executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Deposit Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for under this Deposit Agreement.
     The obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.03 shall survive the replacement, removal or resignation of any Depositary, Registrar, Transfer Agent or Depositary's Agent or termination of this Deposit Agreement.

     The Depositary may at any time be removed by the Company by notice of such removal delivered to the Depositary, such removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided. Upon any such removal or appointment, the Company shall send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of Receipts.
     In case at any time the Depositary acting hereunder shall resign or be removed, the Company shall, within 60 days after the delivery of the notice of resignation or removal, as the case may be, appoint a successor depositary, which shall be an entity having its principal office in the United States of America and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000.

Every successor depositary shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Company an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor depositary, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Company, shall promptly execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all rights, title and interest in the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and any moneys or property held hereunder to such successor and shall deliver to such successor a list of the record holders of all outstanding Receipts.

Pending the preparation of definitive Receipts, the Depositary, upon, and pursuant to, the written order of the Company delivered in
 
compliance with Section 2.02 shall be authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver temporary Receipts which shall be substantially of the tenor of the definitive Receipts in lieu of which they are issued and in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the persons executing such Receipts may determine (but which do not affect the rights or duties of the Depositary), as evidenced by their execution of such Receipts. If temporary Receipts are issued, the Company and the Depositary will cause definitive Receipts to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Receipts, the temporary Receipts shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts upon surrender of the temporary Receipts at the Depositary Office without charge to the holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Receipts, the Depositary is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver in exchange therefor definitive Receipts representing the same number of Depositary Shares as represented by the surrendered temporary Receipt or Receipts. Such exchange shall be made at the Company's expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Receipts shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Deposit Agreement, and with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited, as definitive Receipts.
     Receipts shall be executed by the Depositary by the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Depositary; , that if a Registrar for the Receipts (other than the Depositary) shall have been appointed then such Receipts shall also be countersigned by manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Registrar. No Receipt shall be entitled to any benefits under this Deposit Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless it shall have been executed as provided in the preceding sentence. The Depositary shall record on its books each Receipt executed as provided above and delivered as hereinafter provided. Receipts bearing the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Depositary who was at any time a proper signatory of the Depositary shall bind the Depositary, notwithstanding that such signatory ceased to hold such office prior to the execution and delivery of such Receipts by the Registrar or did not hold such office on the date of issuance of such Receipts.
provided
     Receipts shall be in denominations of any number of whole Depositary Shares. All Receipts shall be dated the date of their issuance.
     Receipts may be endorsed with or have incorporated in the text thereof such legends or recitals or changes not inconsistent with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement as may be required by the Depositary and approved by the Company, or which the Company has determined are required to comply with any applicable law or regulation or with the rules and regulations of any securities exchange upon which the Depositary Shares may be listed for trading or to conform with any usage with respect thereto, or to indicate any special limitations or restrictions to which any particular Receipts are subject, in each case as directed by the Company.
     Title to any Receipt (and to the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt) that is properly endorsed, or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer, or endorsement shall be transferable by delivery with the same effect as in the case of a negotiable instrument; , , that until transfer of a Receipt shall be registered on the books of the Depositary as provided in Section 2.04, the Depositary may, notwithstanding any notice to
provided
however
 
the contrary, treat the record holder thereof at such time as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of determining the person entitled to distributions of dividends or other distributions or payments with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock, to exercise any redemption, voting, or conversion rights or to receive any notice provided for in this Deposit Agreement and for all other purposes.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request by the Company, the Depositary and the Company will make application to DTC for acceptance of all or a portion of the Receipts for its book-entry settlement system. In connection with any such request, the Company hereby appoints the Depositary acting through any authorized officer thereof as its attorney-in-fact, with full power to delegate, for purposes of executing any agreements, certifications or other instruments or documents necessary or desirable in order to effect the acceptance of such Receipts for DTC eligibility. So long as the Receipts are eligible for book-entry settlement with DTC, unless otherwise required by law, all Depositary Shares to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange with book-entry settlement through DTC shall be represented by a single receipt (the "DTC Receipt"), which shall be deposited with DTC (or its custodian) evidencing all such Depositary Shares and registered in the name of the nominee of DTC (initially expected to be Cede & Co.). The Depositary or such other entity as is agreed to by DTC may hold the DTC Receipt as custodian for DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in the DTC Receipt shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected through, records maintained by (i) DTC or its nominee for such DTC Receipt, or (ii) institutions that have accounts with DTC.
     If issued, the DTC Receipt shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts only if (i) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue to make its book-entry settlement system available for the Receipts and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing, (ii) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under applicable law and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing or (iii) the Company executes and delivers to DTC a notice to the effect that such DTC Receipt shall be so exchangeable. If the beneficial owners of interests in Depositary Shares are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Receipts as the result of an event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such beneficial interests may be so exchanged, the Depositary is hereby directed to and shall provide written instructions to DTC to deliver to the Depositary for cancellation the DTC Receipt, and the Company shall instruct the Depositary in writing to execute and deliver to the beneficial owners of the Depositary Shares previously evidenced by the DTC Receipt definitive Receipts in physical form evidencing such Depositary Shares. The DTC Receipt shall be in such form and shall bear such legend or legends as may be appropriate or required by DTC in order for it to accept the Depositary Shares for its book-entry settlement system. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, if the Receipts are at any time eligible for book-entry settlement through DTC, delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and other property in connection with the withdrawal, redemption or conversion of Depositary Shares will be made through DTC and in accordance with its procedures, unless the holder of the relevant Receipt otherwise requests and such request is reasonably acceptable to the Depositary and the Company.

The Depositary acknowledges receipt of the aforementioned 15,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and related documentation and agrees to hold such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock in an account to be established by the Depositary at the Depositary Office or at such other office as the Depositary shall determine. The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder and The Bank of New York hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, will reflect changes in the number of shares (including any fractional shares) of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock held by it by notation, book-entry or other appropriate method.
     If required by the Depositary, Convertible Preferred Stock presented for deposit by the Company at any time, whether or not the register of stockholders of the Company is closed, shall also be accompanied by an agreement or assignment, or other instrument satisfactory to the Depositary, that will provide for the prompt transfer to the Depositary or its nominee of any dividend or right to subscribe for additional Convertible Preferred Stock or to receive other property that any person in whose name the Convertible Preferred Stock is or has been registered may thereafter receive upon or in respect of such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or in lieu thereof such agreement of indemnity or other agreement as shall be satisfactory to the Depositary.
     Upon receipt by the Depositary of a certificate or certificates for Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder, together with the other documents specified above, and upon registering such Convertible Preferred Stock in the name of the Depositary, the Depositary, subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, shall execute and deliver to, or upon the order of, the person or persons named in the written order delivered to the Depositary referred to in the first paragraph of this Section 2.02, a Receipt or Receipts for the number of whole Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock so deposited and registered in such name or names as may be requested by such person or persons. The Depositary shall execute and deliver such Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of any person requesting such delivery, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such person. Other than in the case of splits, combinations or other reclassifications affecting the Convertible Preferred Stock, or in the case of dividends or other distributions of Convertible Preferred Stock, if any, there shall be deposited hereunder not more than the number of shares constituting the Convertible Preferred Stock as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, as such may be amended. To the extent that the Company issues shares of Convertible Preferred Stock in excess of the amount set forth in the Certificate of Designation as of the date hereof
 
(which shares have been validly authorized by the Company), the Company shall notify the Depositary of such issuance in writing.
     The Company shall deliver to the Depositary from time to time such quantities of Receipts as the Depositary may request to enable the Depositary to perform its obligations under this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 2.03
Optional Redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock for Cash.
     Whenever the Company shall elect to redeem shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock for cash in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, it shall (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Depositary) give the Depositary not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior written notice of the date fixed for redemption of such Convertible Preferred Stock (the "redemption date") and of the number of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by the Depositary to be redeemed and the applicable redemption price (the "redemption price"), as set forth in the Certificate of Designation. The Depositary shall mail, first-class postage prepaid, notice of the redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock and the proposed simultaneous redemption of the Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to the holders of record on the record date fixed for such redemption pursuant to Section 4.04 of the Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed, at the addresses of such holders as the same appear on the records of the Depositary; but neither the failure to mail any such notice to one or more such holder nor any defect in any such notice shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for redemption except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given.
     The Company shall prepare and provide the Depositary with such notice, and each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be redeemed; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed; (v) the place or places where the Convertible Preferred Stock and the Receipts evidencing Depositary Shares to be redeemed are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (vi) that on the redemption date dividends in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue.
     In the event that notice of redemption has been made as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs and the Company shall then have paid in full to the Depositary the redemption price (determined pursuant to the Certificate of Designation) of the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary to be redeemed, the Depositary shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Convertible Preferred Stock so called for redemption by the Company and on the redemption date (unless the Company shall have failed to pay for the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed by it as set forth in the Company's notice provided for in the preceding paragraph), all dividends in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock called for redemption shall cease to accrue, the Depositary Shares called for redemption shall be deemed no longer to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (except the right to receive the redemption price) shall, to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate. Upon surrender in accordance
 
with said notice of the Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Depositary shall so require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed at a cash redemption price of $50 per Depositary Share plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the redemption date. The foregoing shall be further subject to the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Deposit Agreement and the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, the provisions of the Certificate of Designation will govern and the Company will instruct the Depositary in writing accordingly of such governing terms; , , that under no circumstances will the Certificate of Designation be deemed to change or modify any of the rights, duties or immunities of the Depositary contained herein.
provided
however
     If fewer than all of the Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt are called for redemption, the Depositary will deliver to the holder of such Receipt upon its surrender to the Depositary, together with payment of the redemption price for and all other amounts payable in respect of the Depositary Shares called for redemption, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares evidenced by such prior Receipt and not called for redemption.
     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemed pursuant to the Company's exercise of its optional redemption right, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be redeemed pursuant to this Section 2.03 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable.
     SECTION 2.04
Registration of Transfers of Receipts.
     The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Receipts and The Bank of New York hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, shall register on its books from time to time transfers of Receipts upon any surrender thereof by the holder in person or by a duly authorized attorney, agent or representative properly endorsed or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement, together with evidence of the payment by the applicable party of any transfer taxes as may be required by law.

Shares by surrendering such Receipt or Receipts to the Depositary or at such other office as the Depositary may designate for such withdrawals; , that a holder of a Receipt or Receipts may not withdraw such Convertible Preferred Stock (or money and other property, if any, represented thereby) which has previously been called for redemption.

If the Receipt or Receipts delivered by the holder to the Depositary in connection with such withdrawal shall evidence a number of Depositary Shares in excess of the number of Depositary Shares representing the number of whole shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock to be withdrawn, the Depositary shall at the same time, in addition to such number of whole shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and such money and other property, if any, to be withdrawn, deliver to such holder, or (subject to Section 2.04) upon his order, a new Receipt or Receipts evidencing such excess number of Depositary Shares. Delivery of such Convertible Preferred Stock and such money and other property being withdrawn may be made by the delivery of such certificates, documents of title and other instruments as the Depositary may deem appropriate, which, if required by the Depositary, shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer.

Conversion at the Option of Holders.
     Subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement and the Certificate of Designation, Receipts may be surrendered at any time by the holders thereof with written instructions to the Depositary instructing it to convert any specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipts into shares of Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock) in accordance with the Certificate of Designation. Depositary shares may be converted at the option of the holders only in lots of 1,000 Depositary Shares or integral multiples thereof.
     On the date of any conversion at the option of the holders, a holder of a Receipt shall surrender such Receipt at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly
 
completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipt to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent, thereby instructing the Depositary to cause the conversion of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt specified in such notice of conversion into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on a Dividend Record Date for any declared dividend for the then-current Dividend Period, but prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date or any holder of Receipts surrendered with instructions to the Depositary for conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipts an amount of funds equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date
 
computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
     In the event that optional conversion is elected by a holder of a surrendered Receipt with respect to less than all Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.10 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     SECTION 2.11
Conversion upon Certain Acquisitions.
     On or before the twentieth day prior to the date on which the Company anticipates consummating a Make-Whole Acquisition (or, if later, promptly after the Company discovers that the Make-Whole Acquisition will occur), a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Company, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Depositary, which notice shall contain (i) the date on which the Make-Whole Acquisition is anticipated to be effected, and whether such Make-Whole Acquisition is anticipated to be a Fundamental Change; and (ii) the date, which shall be 30 days after the anticipated Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date, by which the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option must be exercised. On or before the twentieth day prior to the date on which the Company anticipates consummating the Make-Whole Acquisition (or, if later, promptly after the Company discovers that the Make-Whole Acquisition will occur), a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Depositary, such notice to be prepared by the Company and sent to the Depositary, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of Receipts containing the same information as is contained in the notice received by the Depositary from the Company.
     On the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date, another written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Company, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Depositary, which notice shall contain (i) the date that shall be 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date; (ii) the number of Make-Whole Shares and, if such Make-Whole Acquisition is a Fundamental Change, the Base Price; (iii) the amount of cash, securities and other consideration payable per share of Common Stock and Convertible Preferred Stock (and Depositary Share); and (iv) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise its conversion option in connection with such Make-Whole Acquisition or, if applicable, Fundamental Change. On the Make-Whole
 
Acquisition Effective Date, another written notice also shall be sent by or on behalf of the Depositary, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of Receipts. Such notice shall be prepared by the Company and sent to the Depositary and shall contain: (i) the date that shall be 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date; (ii) the number of Make-Whole Shares and, if such Make-Whole Acquisition is a Fundamental Change, the Base Price; (iii) the amount of cash, securities and other consideration payable per share of Common Stock and Convertible Preferred Stock (and Depositary Share); and (iv) the instructions a holder of Depositary Shares must follow to exercise the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion or, if applicable, the Fundamental Change conversion right of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such holder's Depositary Shares.
     To exercise such Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option, a holder must, no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on or before the date by which the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option must be exercised as specified in the notice described in the preceding paragraph, surrender such holder's Receipts at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipts to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent, thereby instructing the Depositary to cause the conversion of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipts specified in such notice of conversion into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition or a Fundamental Change, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of
 
Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company (or cash in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 10(c) of the Certificate of Designation) and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date with respect to any dividend payment on the Convertible Preferred Stock and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, any holder of Receipts surrendered with instructions to the Depositary for conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipts an amount of funds equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
     In the event that Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion or, if applicable, a Fundamental Change conversion is elected by a holder with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.11 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     SECTION 2.12
Conversion at the Option of the Company.
     In connection with any conversion at the option of the Company in accordance with the Certificate of Designation, the Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) to the Depositary stating that it has complied with all of the conditions to the exercise of its optional conversion rights set forth in the Certificate of
 
Designation, and the Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to inquire or investigate whether the Company has complied with the terms of the Certificate of Designation.
     If the Company exercises such conversion right, it shall provide written notice of such conversion to the Depositary stating, in addition to any information required by applicable law or regulation, (i) the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock; and (iii) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted; (iv) if fewer than all shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be converted, the number of such shares held by such holder to be so converted; (v) the place or places where the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted are to be surrendered for conversion.
     Upon receipt of such notice, the Depositary shall as promptly as practicable provide notice of the Company's exercise of such conversion right to each holder of Receipts, which notice shall be prepared by the Company and sent to the Depositary and shall state (i) the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock (and Depositary Share); (iii) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be converted; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be converted, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so converted; (v) the place or places where the Depositary Shares to be converted are to be surrendered for conversion.
     On the date of any conversion at the option of the Company, a holder of a Receipt must surrender such Receipt at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipt to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt in connection with a conversion at the option of the Company, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
 
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) subject to the next succeeding sentence, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     In the event that conversion at the option of the Company is effected with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.12 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is converted pursuant to a conversion at the option of the Company, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be converted pursuant to this Section 2.12 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable. If the Conversion Agent selects a portion of a holder's Depositary Shares for partial conversion at the option of the Company and the holder converts a portion of the same share of Depositary Shares, the converted portion will be deemed to be from the portion selected for conversion.
     SECTION 2.13
Fractional Shares.
     No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued to a holder of the Depositary Shares upon conversion. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable, the holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock, calculated on an aggregate basis in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted, multiplied by the Closing Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) of the Common Stock on the trading day (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) immediately preceding the applicable conversion date, which shall be paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether the amounts of funds paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion are correct.
 
     SECTION 2.14
No Pre-Release
     The Depositary shall not deliver any deposited Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by Receipts prior to the receipt and cancellation of such Receipts or other similar method used with respect to Receipts held by DTC. The Depositary shall not issue any Receipts prior to the receipt by the Depositary of the corresponding Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by such Receipts. At no time will any Receipts be outstanding if such Receipts do not represent Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary.
     SECTION 3.01
Filing Proofs, Certificates and Other Information.
     Any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file with the Depositary such proof of residence, guarantee of signature or other information and to execute such certificates as the Depositary may reasonably deem necessary or proper or the Company may reasonably require by written request to the Depositary. The Depositary or the Company may withhold or delay the delivery of any Receipt, the transfer, redemption or exchange of any Receipt, the withdrawal of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by any Receipt, the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof, until such proof or other information is filed, or such certificates are executed.
     SECTION 3.02
Payment of Fees and Expenses.
     Holders of Receipts shall be obligated to make payments to the Depositary of certain fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges to the extent provided in Section 5.07, or provide evidence satisfactory to the Depositary that such fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges have been paid. Until such payment is made, transfer of any Receipt or any withdrawal of the Convertible Preferred Stock or money or other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be refused, any dividend or other distribution may be withheld, and any part or all of the Convertible Preferred Stock or other property represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be sold for the account of the holder thereof (after attempting by reasonable means to notify such holder a reasonable number of days prior to such sale). Any dividend or other distribution so withheld and the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such fees or expenses, the holder of such Receipt remaining liable for any deficiency.
     SECTION 3.03
Representations and Warranties as to Convertible Preferred Stock.
     In the case of the initial deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock hereunder, the Company represents and warrants that such Convertible Preferred Stock and each certificate therefor are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Such representations and warranties shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts.
 
     SECTION 3.04
Representation and Warranty as to Receipts and Depositary Shares.
     The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will evidence legal and valid interests in the Depositary Shares and each Depositary Share will represent a legal and valid 1/1,000 fractional interest in a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Share. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares.
th
     SECTION 3.05
Taxes.
     The Company will pay any and all stock transfer, documentary, stamp and similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of Depositary Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Depositary Shares or certificates representing such shares or securities. The Company will not, however, be required to pay any such tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, shares of Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in which the Depositary Shares with respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment to any person other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and will not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
     SECTION 4.01
Cash Distributions.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, including any cash received upon redemption of any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.03, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of such sum as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders; , , that in case the Company or the Depositary shall be required by law to and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Receipts held by any holder an amount on account of taxes or as otherwise required by law, regulation or court process, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares represented by such Receipts subject to such withholding shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary, however, shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Receipts a fraction of one cent. Any such fractional amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent and so distributed to registered holders entitled thereto and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for
provided
however
 
interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next succeeding distribution to record holders of such Receipts. Each holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with a properly completed Form W-8 (i.e., Form W-8BEN, Form W-8EXP, Form W-8IMY, Form W8ECI or another applicable Form W-8) or Form W-9 (which form shall set forth such holder's certified taxpayer identification number if requested on such form), as may be applicable. Each holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distribution to be made hereunder.
     SECTION 4.02
Distributions Other Than Cash.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Depositary and the Company may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of securities to the holders of Receipts unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such securities have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
     SECTION 4.03
Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
     If the Company shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names deposited Convertible Preferred Stock is registered on the books of the Company any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts in such manner as the Company shall instruct (including by the issue to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges); , , that (a) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Company determines upon advice of its legal counsel that it is not lawful or feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to the holders of Receipts (by the issue of warrants or otherwise) or (b) if and to the extent instructed by holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, the Depositary shall then, if so directed by the Company and provided with an opinion of counsel that if Depositary undertakes such actions it will not be deemed an "issuer" under the Securities Act or an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges so permit, sell such rights, preferences or privileges of such holders at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Section 3.01 and Section 3.02, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.01 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of such rights, preferences or privileges, unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such rights, preferences or privileges have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
provided
however
 
     If registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement that it will promptly file a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such a registration statement shall have become effective or unless the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act and the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to such effect.
     If any other action under the law of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
     The Depositary will not be deemed to have any knowledge of any item for which it is supposed to receive notification under any Section of this Deposit Agreement unless and until it has received such notification.
     SECTION 4.04
Notice of Dividends; Fixing of Record Date for Holders of Receipts.
     Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable, any distribution other than cash shall be made, or any rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of (i) any meeting at which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to notice or (ii) any election on the part of the Company to redeem any shares of such Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting or to receive notice of such meeting or whose Depositary Shares are to be so redeemed.
     SECTION 4.05
Voting Rights.
     Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice, which shall be provided by the Company and which
 
shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting, (ii) a statement that the holders of Receipts at the close of business on a specified record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 will be entitled, subject to any applicable provision of law, to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares and (iii) a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of a holder of a Receipt on such record date, the Depositary shall insofar as practicable vote or cause to be voted the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request. To the extent any such instructions request the voting of a fractional interest of a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall aggregate such interest with all other fractional interests resulting from requests with the same voting instructions and shall vote the number of whole votes resulting from such aggregation in accordance with the instructions received in such requests. Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote and, accordingly, each Depositary Share is entitled to 1/1000 of a vote. The Company hereby agrees to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Convertible Preferred Stock or cause such Convertible Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will vote all Depositary Shares held by it in proportion with any instructions received. The Depositary shall not exercise any discretion in voting any Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.
th
     SECTION 4.06
Changes Affecting Convertible Preferred Stock and Reorganization Events.
     Upon any change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Convertible Preferred Stock, any Reorganization Event or any exchange of the Convertible Preferred Stock for cash, securities or other property, the Depositary shall, upon the written instructions of the Company setting forth any of the following adjustments, (i) reflect such adjustments in the Depositary's books and records in (a) the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Convertible Preferred Stock and (b) the ratio of the redemption price and the conversion rate per Depositary Share to the redemption price and the conversion rate, respectively, of a share of Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case as may be required by or as is consistent with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation to fully reflect the effects of such change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Convertible Preferred Stock, of such Reorganization Event or of such exchange and (ii) treat any shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) that shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock as new deposited property under this Deposit Agreement, and Receipts then outstanding shall thenceforth represent the proportionate interests of holders thereof in the new deposited property so received in exchange for or in respect of such Convertible Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may, upon the receipt of written request of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts, or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited property.
 
     SECTION 4.07
Inspection of Reports.
     The Depositary shall make available for inspection by holders of Receipts at the Depositary Office and at such other places as it may from time to time deem advisable during normal business hours any reports and communications received from the Company that are both received by the Depositary as the holder of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and made generally available to the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Depositary shall transmit, upon written request by the Company, certain notices and reports to the holders of Receipts as provided in Section 5.05.
     SECTION 4.08
Lists of Receipt Holders.
     Promptly upon request from time to time by the Company, the Registrar shall furnish to the Company a list, as of a recent date specified by the Company, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary Shares of all persons in whose names Receipts are registered on the books of the Registrar.
     SECTION 4.09
Withholding.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Deposit Agreement, in the event that the Depositary determines that any distribution in property is subject to any tax or other governmental charge which the Depositary is obligated by law to withhold, the Depositary may dispose of, by public or private sale, all or a portion of such property in such amounts and in such manner as the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay such taxes, and the Depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of any such sale or the balance of any such property after deduction of such taxes to the holders of Receipts entitled thereto in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares held by them, respectively; , , that in the event the Depositary determines that such distribution of property is subject to withholding tax only with respect to some but not all holders of Receipts, the Depositary will use its best efforts (i) to sell only that portion of such property distributable to such holders that is required to generate sufficient proceeds to pay such withholding tax and (ii) to effect any such sale in such a manner so as to avoid affecting the rights of any other holders of Receipts to receive such distribution in property.

     SECTION 5.01
Maintenance of Offices, Agencies and Transfer Books by the Depositary and the Registrar.
     The Depositary shall maintain at the Depositary Office facilities for the execution and delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange, split-up, combination and redemption of Receipts and deposit and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock and at the offices of the Depositary's Agents, if any, facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange, split-up, combination and redemption of Receipts and deposit and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock, all in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement.
 
     The Registrar shall keep books at the Depositary Office for the registration and transfer of Receipts, which books at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the record holders of Receipts as provided by applicable law. The Company may cause the Registrar to close such books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.
     If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or any other stock exchange, the Depositary may, with the written approval of the Company, appoint a registrar (acceptable to the Company) for registration of such Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with the requirements of such exchange. Such registrar (which may be the Registrar if so permitted by the requirements of such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar appointed by the Registrar upon the request or with the written approval of the Company. If the Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock are listed on one or more other stock exchanges, the Registrar will, at the request and expense of the Company, arrange such facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender, redemption and exchange of such Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock as may be required by law or applicable stock exchange regulations.

     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar, any Transfer Agent, or the Company shall incur any liability to any holder of any Receipt, if by reason of any provision of any present or future law or regulation thereunder of the United States of America or of any other governmental authority or, in the case of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or the Registrar or Transfer Agent, by reason of any provision, present or future, of the Certificate of Incorporation or, in the case of the Company, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar, by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party, the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Company shall be prevented or forbidden from doing or performing any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall be done or performed; nor shall the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, any Registrar or the Company incur any liability to any holder of a Receipt by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall or may be done or performed, or by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 5.03
Obligations of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar and the Company.
     The Company does not assume any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement or any Receipt to holders of Receipts other than from acts or omissions arising out of conduct constituting bad faith, negligence (in the case of any action or inaction with respect to the voting of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock), gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement. Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or
 
Registrar assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to holders of Receipts, the Company or any other person or entity other than for its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Depositary, nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, lost profits, even if such person or entity alleged to be liable has knowledge of the possibility of such damages. Any liability of the Depositary and any Registrar or Transfer Agent under this Deposit Agreement will be limited to the amount of annual fees paid by the Company to the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares or Receipts that in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability, unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information provided by any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent and the Company may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
     In the event the Depositary shall receive conflicting claims, requests or instructions from any holders of Receipts, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, the Depositary shall be entitled to act on such claims, requests or instructions received from the Company, and shall incur no liability and shall be entitled to the full indemnification set forth in Section 5.06 in connection with any action so taken.
     The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action does not result from bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Depositary (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). The Depositary undertakes, and any Registrar or Transfer Agent shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
     The Depositary, its parent, affiliate, or subsidiaries, any Depositary's Agent, and any Registrar or Transfer Agent may own, buy, sell or deal in any class of securities of the Company and its affiliates and in Receipts or Depositary Shares or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company or its affiliates may be interested or contract with or lend money to or otherwise act as fully or as freely as if it were not the Depositary or the Depositary's Agent
 
hereunder. The Depositary may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Company and its affiliates or act in any other capacity for the Company or its affiliates.
     It is intended that neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent shall be deemed to be an "issuer" of the securities under the federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Depositary and any Depositary's Agent are acting only in a ministerial capacity as Depositary for the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock; , , that the Depositary agrees to comply with all information reporting and withholding requirements applicable to it under law or this Deposit Agreement in its capacity as Depositary.
provided
however
     Neither the Depositary (or its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates) nor any Depositary's Agent makes any representation or has any responsibility as to the validity of the registration statement pursuant to which the Depositary Shares are registered under the Securities Act, the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares, the Receipts (except its countersignature thereon) or any instruments referred to therein or herein, or as to the correctness of any statement made therein or herein; , , that the Depositary is responsible for its representations in this Deposit Agreement.
provided
however
     The Company agrees that it will register the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and the Depositary Shares in accordance with the applicable securities laws.
     In the event the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or any Registrar or Transfer Agent believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists in any notice, instruction, direction, request or other communication, paper or document received by it pursuant to this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall promptly notify the Company of the details of such alleged ambiguity or uncertainty, and may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any action, and the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be fully protected and shall incur no liability to any person from refraining from taking such action, absent bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction), unless and until (i) the rights of all parties have been fully and finally adjudicated by a court of appropriate jurisdiction or (ii) the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar receives written instructions with respect to such matter signed by the Company that eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar.
     Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively provided and established by a certificate signed by any one of the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasuer, Head of Corporate Finance, the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar; and such certificate shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar and the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent,
 
Transfer Agent or Registrar shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Deposit Agreement in reliance upon such certificate. The Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Deposit Agreement or in the Receipts (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
     The Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar will not be under any duty or responsibility to ensure compliance with any applicable federal or state securities laws in connection with the issuance, transfer or exchange of the Receipts, Stock or Depositary Shares.
     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment to the Certificate of Designation shall affect the rights, duties, obligations or immunities of the Depositary, Transfer Agent, the Depositary's Agent or Registrar hereunder.
     The Depositary, Transfer Agent and any Registrar hereunder:
          (i) shall have no duties or obligations other than those specifically set forth herein (and no implied duties or obligations), or as may subsequently be agreed to in writing by the parties;
          (ii) shall have no obligation to make payment hereunder unless the Company shall have provided the necessary federal or other immediately available funds or securities or property, as the case may be, to pay in full amounts due and payable with respect thereto;
          (iii) shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder; if, however, the Depositary determines to take any legal or other action hereunder, and, where the taking of such action might in the Depositary's judgment subject or expose it to any expense or liability, the Depositary shall not be required to act unless it shall have been furnished with an indemnity satisfactory to it;
          (iv) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon any certificate, instrument, opinion, notice, letter, facsimile transmission or other document or security delivered to the Depositary and believed by the Depositary to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper party or parties, and shall have no responsibility for determining the accuracy thereof;
          (v) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon the written, telephonic, electronic and oral instructions, with respect to any matter relating to the Depositary's actions as depositary covered by this Deposit Agreement (or supplementing or qualifying any such actions) of officers of the Company;
          (vi) may consult counsel satisfactory to it, and the advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by the Depositary hereunder in accordance with the advice of such counsel;
 
          (vii) shall not be called upon at any time to advise any person with respect to the Depositary Shares or Receipts;
          (viii) shall not be liable or responsible for any recital or statement contained in any documents relating hereto or the Depositary Shares or Receipts; and
          (ix) shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties (other than with respect to the Depositary) executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Deposit Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for under this Deposit Agreement.
     The obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.03 shall survive the replacement, removal or resignation of any Depositary, Registrar, Transfer Agent or Depositary's Agent or termination of this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 5.04
Resignation and Removal of the Depositary; Appointment of Successor Depositary.
     The Depositary may at any time resign as Depositary hereunder by notice of its election to do so delivered to the Company, such resignation to take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided.
     The Depositary may at any time be removed by the Company by notice of such removal delivered to the Depositary, such removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided. Upon any such removal or appointment, the Company shall send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of Receipts.
     In case at any time the Depositary acting hereunder shall resign or be removed, the Company shall, within 60 days after the delivery of the notice of resignation or removal, as the case may be, appoint a successor depositary, which shall be an entity having its principal office in the United States of America and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If a successor depositary shall not have been appointed and have accepted appointment in 60 days, the resigning Depositary may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor depositary. Every successor depositary shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Company an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor depositary, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Company, shall promptly execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all rights, title and interest in the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and any moneys or property held hereunder to such successor and shall deliver to such successor a list of the record holders of all outstanding Receipts.
     Any corporation or other entity into or with which the Depositary may be merged, consolidated or converted, or any corporation or other entity to which all or a substantial part of the assets of the Depositary may be transferred, shall be the successor of such Depositary without the
 
execution or filing of any document or any further act. Such successor depositary may execute the Receipts either in the name of the predecessor depositary or in the name of the successor depositary.
     The provisions of this Section 5.04 as they apply to the Depositary apply to the Registrar and Transfer Agent, as if specifically enumerated herein.

In no event shall any amendment impair the right, subject to the provisions of Section 2.06 and Section 2.07 and Article III, of any holder of any Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares to surrender any Receipt with instructions to the Depositary to deliver to the holder the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and all money and other property, if any, represented thereby, except in order to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law.

Pending the preparation of definitive Receipts, the Depositary, upon, and pursuant to, the written order of the Company delivered in
 
compliance with Section 2.02 shall be authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver temporary Receipts which shall be substantially of the tenor of the definitive Receipts in lieu of which they are issued and in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the persons executing such Receipts may determine (but which do not affect the rights or duties of the Depositary), as evidenced by their execution of such Receipts. If temporary Receipts are issued, the Company and the Depositary will cause definitive Receipts to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Receipts, the temporary Receipts shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts upon surrender of the temporary Receipts at the Depositary Office without charge to the holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Receipts, the Depositary is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver in exchange therefor definitive Receipts representing the same number of Depositary Shares as represented by the surrendered temporary Receipt or Receipts. Such exchange shall be made at the Company's expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Receipts shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Deposit Agreement, and with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited, as definitive Receipts.
     Receipts shall be executed by the Depositary by the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Depositary; , that if a Registrar for the Receipts (other than the Depositary) shall have been appointed then such Receipts shall also be countersigned by manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Registrar. No Receipt shall be entitled to any benefits under this Deposit Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless it shall have been executed as provided in the preceding sentence. The Depositary shall record on its books each Receipt executed as provided above and delivered as hereinafter provided. Receipts bearing the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Depositary who was at any time a proper signatory of the Depositary shall bind the Depositary, notwithstanding that such signatory ceased to hold such office prior to the execution and delivery of such Receipts by the Registrar or did not hold such office on the date of issuance of such Receipts.
provided
     Receipts shall be in denominations of any number of whole Depositary Shares. All Receipts shall be dated the date of their issuance.
     Receipts may be endorsed with or have incorporated in the text thereof such legends or recitals or changes not inconsistent with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement as may be required by the Depositary and approved by the Company, or which the Company has determined are required to comply with any applicable law or regulation or with the rules and regulations of any securities exchange upon which the Depositary Shares may be listed for trading or to conform with any usage with respect thereto, or to indicate any special limitations or restrictions to which any particular Receipts are subject, in each case as directed by the Company.
     Title to any Receipt (and to the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt) that is properly endorsed, or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer, or endorsement shall be transferable by delivery with the same effect as in the case of a negotiable instrument; , , that until transfer of a Receipt shall be registered on the books of the Depositary as provided in Section 2.04, the Depositary may, notwithstanding any notice to
provided
however
 
the contrary, treat the record holder thereof at such time as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of determining the person entitled to distributions of dividends or other distributions or payments with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock, to exercise any redemption, voting, or conversion rights or to receive any notice provided for in this Deposit Agreement and for all other purposes.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request by the Company, the Depositary and the Company will make application to DTC for acceptance of all or a portion of the Receipts for its book-entry settlement system. In connection with any such request, the Company hereby appoints the Depositary acting through any authorized officer thereof as its attorney-in-fact, with full power to delegate, for purposes of executing any agreements, certifications or other instruments or documents necessary or desirable in order to effect the acceptance of such Receipts for DTC eligibility. So long as the Receipts are eligible for book-entry settlement with DTC, unless otherwise required by law, all Depositary Shares to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange with book-entry settlement through DTC shall be represented by a single receipt (the "DTC Receipt"), which shall be deposited with DTC (or its custodian) evidencing all such Depositary Shares and registered in the name of the nominee of DTC (initially expected to be Cede & Co.). The Depositary or such other entity as is agreed to by DTC may hold the DTC Receipt as custodian for DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in the DTC Receipt shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected through, records maintained by (i) DTC or its nominee for such DTC Receipt, or (ii) institutions that have accounts with DTC.
     If issued, the DTC Receipt shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts only if (i) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue to make its book-entry settlement system available for the Receipts and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing, (ii) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under applicable law and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing or (iii) the Company executes and delivers to DTC a notice to the effect that such DTC Receipt shall be so exchangeable. If the beneficial owners of interests in Depositary Shares are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Receipts as the result of an event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such beneficial interests may be so exchanged, the Depositary is hereby directed to and shall provide written instructions to DTC to deliver to the Depositary for cancellation the DTC Receipt, and the Company shall instruct the Depositary in writing to execute and deliver to the beneficial owners of the Depositary Shares previously evidenced by the DTC Receipt definitive Receipts in physical form evidencing such Depositary Shares. The DTC Receipt shall be in such form and shall bear such legend or legends as may be appropriate or required by DTC in order for it to accept the Depositary Shares for its book-entry settlement system. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, if the Receipts are at any time eligible for book-entry settlement through DTC, delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and other property in connection with the withdrawal, redemption or conversion of Depositary Shares will be made through DTC and in accordance with its procedures, unless the holder of the relevant Receipt otherwise requests and such request is reasonably acceptable to the Depositary and the Company.

The Depositary acknowledges receipt of the aforementioned 9,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and related documentation and agrees to hold such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock in an account to be established by the Depositary at the Depositary Office or at such other office as the Depositary shall determine. The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder and The Bank of New York hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, will reflect changes in the number of shares (including any fractional shares) of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock held by it by notation, book-entry or other appropriate method.
     If required by the Depositary, Convertible Preferred Stock presented for deposit by the Company at any time, whether or not the register of stockholders of the Company is closed, shall also be accompanied by an agreement or assignment, or other instrument satisfactory to the Depositary, that will provide for the prompt transfer to the Depositary or its nominee of any dividend or right to subscribe for additional Convertible Preferred Stock or to receive other property that any person in whose name the Convertible Preferred Stock is or has been registered may thereafter receive upon or in respect of such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or in lieu thereof such agreement of indemnity or other agreement as shall be satisfactory to the Depositary.
     Upon receipt by the Depositary of a certificate or certificates for Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder, together with the other documents specified above, and upon registering such Convertible Preferred Stock in the name of the Depositary, the Depositary, subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, shall execute and deliver to, or upon the order of, the person or persons named in the written order delivered to the Depositary referred to in the first paragraph of this Section 2.02, a Receipt or Receipts for the number of whole Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock so deposited and registered in such name or names as may be requested by such person or persons. The Depositary shall execute and deliver such Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of any person requesting such delivery, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such person. Other than in the case of splits, combinations or other reclassifications affecting the Convertible Preferred Stock, or in the case of dividends or other distributions of Convertible Preferred Stock, if any, there shall be deposited hereunder not more than the number of shares constituting the Convertible Preferred Stock as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, as such may be amended. To the extent that the Company issues shares of Convertible Preferred Stock in excess of the amount set forth in the Certificate of Designation as of the date hereof
 
(which shares have been validly authorized by the Company), the Company shall notify the Depositary of such issuance in writing.
     The Company shall deliver to the Depositary from time to time such quantities of Receipts as the Depositary may request to enable the Depositary to perform its obligations under this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 2.03
Optional Redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock for Cash.
     Whenever the Company shall elect to redeem shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock for cash in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, it shall (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Depositary) give the Depositary not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior written notice of the date fixed for redemption of such Convertible Preferred Stock (the "redemption date") and of the number of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by the Depositary to be redeemed and the applicable redemption price (the "redemption price"), as set forth in the Certificate of Designation. The Depositary shall mail, first-class postage prepaid, notice of the redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock and the proposed simultaneous redemption of the Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to the holders of record on the record date fixed for such redemption pursuant to Section 4.04 of the Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed, at the addresses of such holders as the same appear on the records of the Depositary; but neither the failure to mail any such notice to one or more such holder nor any defect in any such notice shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for redemption except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given.
     The Company shall prepare and provide the Depositary with such notice, and each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be redeemed; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed; (v) the place or places where the Convertible Preferred Stock and the Receipts evidencing Depositary Shares to be redeemed are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (vi) that on the redemption date dividends in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue.
     In the event that notice of redemption has been made as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs and the Company shall then have paid in full to the Depositary the redemption price (determined pursuant to the Certificate of Designation) of the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary to be redeemed, the Depositary shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Convertible Preferred Stock so called for redemption by the Company and on the redemption date (unless the Company shall have failed to pay for the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed by it as set forth in the Company's notice provided for in the preceding paragraph), all dividends in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock called for redemption shall cease to accrue, the Depositary Shares called for redemption shall be deemed no longer to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (except the right to receive the redemption price) shall, to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate. Upon surrender in accordance
 
with said notice of the Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Depositary shall so require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed at a cash redemption price of $50 per Depositary Share plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the redemption date. The foregoing shall be further subject to the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Deposit Agreement and the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, the provisions of the Certificate of Designation will govern and the Company will instruct the Depositary in writing accordingly of such governing terms; , , that under no circumstances will the Certificate of Designation be deemed to change or modify any of the rights, duties or immunities of the Depositary contained herein.
provided
however

     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemed pursuant to the Company's exercise of its optional redemption right, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be redeemed pursuant to this Section 2.03 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable.
     SECTION 2.04

Shares by surrendering such Receipt or Receipts to the Depositary or at such other office as the Depositary may designate for such withdrawals; , that a holder of a Receipt or Receipts may not withdraw such Convertible Preferred Stock (or money and other property, if any, represented thereby) which has previously been called for redemption.

If the Receipt or Receipts delivered by the holder to the Depositary in connection with such withdrawal shall evidence a number of Depositary Shares in excess of the number of Depositary Shares representing the number of whole shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock to be withdrawn, the Depositary shall at the same time, in addition to such number of whole shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and such money and other property, if any, to be withdrawn, deliver to such holder, or (subject to Section 2.04) upon his order, a new Receipt or Receipts evidencing such excess number of Depositary Shares.

Conversion at the Option of Holders.
     Subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement and the Certificate of Designation, Receipts may be surrendered at any time by the holders thereof with written instructions to the Depositary instructing it to convert any specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipts into shares of Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock) in accordance with the Certificate of Designation. Depositary shares may be converted at the option of the holders only in lots of 1,000 Depositary Shares or integral multiples thereof.
     On the date of any conversion at the option of the holders, a holder of a Receipt shall surrender such Receipt at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly
 
completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipt to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent, thereby instructing the Depositary to cause the conversion of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt specified in such notice of conversion into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on a Dividend Record Date for any declared dividend for the then-current Dividend Period, but prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date or any holder of Receipts surrendered with instructions to the Depositary for conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipts an amount of funds equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date
 
computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
     In the event that optional conversion is elected by a holder of a surrendered Receipt with respect to less than all Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.10 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.

Such notice shall be prepared by the Company and sent to the Depositary and shall contain: (i) the date that shall be 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date; (ii) the number of Make-Whole Shares and, if such Make-Whole Acquisition is a Fundamental Change, the Base Price; (iii) the amount of cash, securities and other consideration payable per share of Common Stock and Convertible Preferred Stock (and Depositary Share); and (iv) the instructions a holder of Depositary Shares must follow to exercise the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion or, if applicable, the Fundamental Change conversion right of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such holder's Depositary Shares.
     To exercise such Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option, a holder must, no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on or before the date by which the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option must be exercised as specified in the notice described in the preceding paragraph, surrender such holder's Receipts at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipts to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent, thereby instructing the Depositary to cause the conversion of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipts specified in such notice of conversion into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition or a Fundamental Change, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of
 
Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company (or cash in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 10(c) of the Certificate of Designation) and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date with respect to any dividend payment on the Convertible Preferred Stock and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, any holder of Receipts surrendered with instructions to the Depositary for conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipts an amount of funds equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
     In the event that Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion or, if applicable, a Fundamental Change conversion is elected by a holder with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.11 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     SECTION 2.12
Conversion at the Option of the Company.
     In connection with any conversion at the option of the Company in accordance with the Certificate of Designation, the Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) to the Depositary stating that it has complied with all of the conditions to the exercise of its optional conversion rights set forth in the Certificate of
 
Designation, and the Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to inquire or investigate whether the Company has complied with the terms of the Certificate of Designation.
     If the Company exercises such conversion right, it shall provide written notice of such conversion to the Depositary stating, in addition to any information required by applicable law or regulation, (i) the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock; and (iii) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted; (iv) if fewer than all shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be converted, the number of such shares held by such holder to be so converted; (v) the place or places where the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted are to be surrendered for conversion.
     Upon receipt of such notice, the Depositary shall as promptly as practicable provide notice of the Company's exercise of such conversion right to each holder of Receipts, which notice shall be prepared by the Company and sent to the Depositary and shall state (i) the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock (and Depositary Share); (iii) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be converted; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be converted, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so converted; (v) the place or places where the Depositary Shares to be converted are to be surrendered for conversion.
     On the date of any conversion at the option of the Company, a holder of a Receipt must surrender such Receipt at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipt to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt in connection with a conversion at the option of the Company, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
 
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) subject to the next succeeding sentence, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     In the event that conversion at the option of the Company is effected with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.12 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is converted pursuant to a conversion at the option of the Company, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be converted pursuant to this Section 2.12 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable. If the Conversion Agent selects a portion of a holder's Depositary Shares for partial conversion at the option of the Company and the holder converts a portion of the same share of Depositary Shares, the converted portion will be deemed to be from the portion selected for conversion.
     SECTION 2.13
Fractional Shares.
     No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued to a holder of the Depositary Shares upon conversion. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable, the holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock, calculated on an aggregate basis in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted, multiplied by the Closing Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) of the Common Stock on the trading day (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) immediately preceding the applicable conversion date, which shall be paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether the amounts of funds paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion are correct.
 
     SECTION 2.14
No Pre-Release
     The Depositary shall not deliver any deposited Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by Receipts prior to the receipt and cancellation of such Receipts or other similar method used with respect to Receipts held by DTC. The Depositary shall not issue any Receipts prior to the receipt by the Depositary of the corresponding Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by such Receipts. At no time will any Receipts be outstanding if such Receipts do not represent Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary.
     SECTION 3.01
Filing Proofs, Certificates and Other Information.
     Any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file with the Depositary such proof of residence, guarantee of signature or other information and to execute such certificates as the Depositary may reasonably deem necessary or proper or the Company may reasonably require by written request to the Depositary. The Depositary or the Company may withhold or delay the delivery of any Receipt, the transfer, redemption or exchange of any Receipt, the withdrawal of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by any Receipt, the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof, until such proof or other information is filed, or such certificates are executed.
     SECTION 3.02
Payment of Fees and Expenses.
     Holders of Receipts shall be obligated to make payments to the Depositary of certain fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges to the extent provided in Section 5.07, or provide evidence satisfactory to the Depositary that such fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges have been paid. Until such payment is made, transfer of any Receipt or any withdrawal of the Convertible Preferred Stock or money or other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be refused, any dividend or other distribution may be withheld, and any part or all of the Convertible Preferred Stock or other property represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be sold for the account of the holder thereof (after attempting by reasonable means to notify such holder a reasonable number of days prior to such sale). Any dividend or other distribution so withheld and the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such fees or expenses, the holder of such Receipt remaining liable for any deficiency.
     SECTION 3.03
Representations and Warranties as to Convertible Preferred Stock.
     In the case of the initial deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock hereunder, the Company represents and warrants that such Convertible Preferred Stock and each certificate therefor are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Such representations and warranties shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts.
 
     SECTION 3.04
Representation and Warranty as to Receipts and Depositary Shares.
     The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will evidence legal and valid interests in the Depositary Shares and each Depositary Share will represent a legal and valid 1/1,000 fractional interest in a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Share. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares.
th
     SECTION 3.05
Taxes.
     The Company will pay any and all stock transfer, documentary, stamp and similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of Depositary Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Depositary Shares or certificates representing such shares or securities. The Company will not, however, be required to pay any such tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, shares of Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in which the Depositary Shares with respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment to any person other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and will not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
     SECTION 4.01
Cash Distributions.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, including any cash received upon redemption of any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.03, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of such sum as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders; , , that in case the Company or the Depositary shall be required by law to and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Receipts held by any holder an amount on account of taxes or as otherwise required by law, regulation or court process, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares represented by such Receipts subject to such withholding shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary, however, shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Receipts a fraction of one cent. Any such fractional amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent and so distributed to registered holders entitled thereto and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for
provided
however
 
interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next succeeding distribution to record holders of such Receipts. Each holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with a properly completed Form W-8 (i.e., Form W-8BEN, Form W-8EXP, Form W-8IMY, Form W8ECI or another applicable Form W-8) or Form W-9 (which form shall set forth such holder's certified taxpayer identification number if requested on such form), as may be applicable. Each holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distribution to be made hereunder.
     SECTION 4.02
Distributions Other Than Cash.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Depositary and the Company may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of securities to the holders of Receipts unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such securities have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
     SECTION 4.03
Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
     If the Company shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names deposited Convertible Preferred Stock is registered on the books of the Company any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts in such manner as the Company shall instruct (including by the issue to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges); , , that (a) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Company determines upon advice of its legal counsel that it is not lawful or feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to the holders of Receipts (by the issue of warrants or otherwise) or (b) if and to the extent instructed by holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, the Depositary shall then, if so directed by the Company and provided with an opinion of counsel that if Depositary undertakes such actions it will not be deemed an "issuer" under the Securities Act or an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges so permit, sell such rights, preferences or privileges of such holders at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Section 3.01 and Section 3.02, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.01 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of such rights, preferences or privileges, unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such rights, preferences or privileges have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
provided
however
 
     If registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement that it will promptly file a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such a registration statement shall have become effective or unless the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act and the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to such effect.
     If any other action under the law of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
     The Depositary will not be deemed to have any knowledge of any item for which it is supposed to receive notification under any Section of this Deposit Agreement unless and until it has received such notification.
     SECTION 4.04
Notice of Dividends; Fixing of Record Date for Holders of Receipts.
     Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable, any distribution other than cash shall be made, or any rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of (i) any meeting at which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to notice or (ii) any election on the part of the Company to redeem any shares of such Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting or to receive notice of such meeting or whose Depositary Shares are to be so redeemed.
     SECTION 4.05
Voting Rights.
     Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice, which shall be provided by the Company and which
 
shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting, (ii) a statement that the holders of Receipts at the close of business on a specified record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 will be entitled, subject to any applicable provision of law, to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares and (iii) a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of a holder of a Receipt on such record date, the Depositary shall insofar as practicable vote or cause to be voted the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request. To the extent any such instructions request the voting of a fractional interest of a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall aggregate such interest with all other fractional interests resulting from requests with the same voting instructions and shall vote the number of whole votes resulting from such aggregation in accordance with the instructions received in such requests. Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote and, accordingly, each Depositary Share is entitled to 1/1000 of a vote. The Company hereby agrees to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Convertible Preferred Stock or cause such Convertible Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will vote all Depositary Shares held by it in proportion with any instructions received. The Depositary shall not exercise any discretion in voting any Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.
th
     SECTION 4.06
Changes Affecting Convertible Preferred Stock and Reorganization Events.
     Upon any change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Convertible Preferred Stock, any Reorganization Event or any exchange of the Convertible Preferred Stock for cash, securities or other property, the Depositary shall, upon the written instructions of the Company setting forth any of the following adjustments, (i) reflect such adjustments in the Depositary's books and records in (a) the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Convertible Preferred Stock and (b) the ratio of the redemption price and the conversion rate per Depositary Share to the redemption price and the conversion rate, respectively, of a share of Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case as may be required by or as is consistent with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation to fully reflect the effects of such change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Convertible Preferred Stock, of such Reorganization Event or of such exchange and (ii) treat any shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) that shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock as new deposited property under this Deposit Agreement, and Receipts then outstanding shall thenceforth represent the proportionate interests of holders thereof in the new deposited property so received in exchange for or in respect of such Convertible Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may, upon the receipt of written request of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts, or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited property.
 
     SECTION 4.07
Inspection of Reports.
     The Depositary shall make available for inspection by holders of Receipts at the Depositary Office and at such other places as it may from time to time deem advisable during normal business hours any reports and communications received from the Company that are both received by the Depositary as the holder of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and made generally available to the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Depositary shall transmit, upon written request by the Company, certain notices and reports to the holders of Receipts as provided in Section 5.05.
     SECTION 4.08
Lists of Receipt Holders.
     Promptly upon request from time to time by the Company, the Registrar shall furnish to the Company a list, as of a recent date specified by the Company, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary Shares of all persons in whose names Receipts are registered on the books of the Registrar.
     SECTION 4.09
Withholding.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Deposit Agreement, in the event that the Depositary determines that any distribution in property is subject to any tax or other governmental charge which the Depositary is obligated by law to withhold, the Depositary may dispose of, by public or private sale, all or a portion of such property in such amounts and in such manner as the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay such taxes, and the Depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of any such sale or the balance of any such property after deduction of such taxes to the holders of Receipts entitled thereto in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares held by them, respectively; , , that in the event the Depositary determines that such distribution of property is subject to withholding tax only with respect to some but not all holders of Receipts, the Depositary will use its best efforts (i) to sell only that portion of such property distributable to such holders that is required to generate sufficient proceeds to pay such withholding tax and (ii) to effect any such sale in such a manner so as to avoid affecting the rights of any other holders of Receipts to receive such distribution in property.

     SECTION 5.01
Maintenance of Offices, Agencies and Transfer Books by the Depositary and the Registrar.
     The Depositary shall maintain at the Depositary Office facilities for the execution and delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange, split-up, combination and redemption of Receipts and deposit and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock and at the offices of the Depositary's Agents, if any, facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange, split-up, combination and redemption of Receipts and deposit and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock, all in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement.
 
     The Registrar shall keep books at the Depositary Office for the registration and transfer of Receipts, which books at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the record holders of Receipts as provided by applicable law. The Company may cause the Registrar to close such books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.
     If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or any other stock exchange, the Depositary may, with the written approval of the Company, appoint a registrar (acceptable to the Company) for registration of such Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with the requirements of such exchange. Such registrar (which may be the Registrar if so permitted by the requirements of such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar appointed by the Registrar upon the request or with the written approval of the Company. If the Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock are listed on one or more other stock exchanges, the Registrar will, at the request and expense of the Company, arrange such facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender, redemption and exchange of such Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock as may be required by law or applicable stock exchange regulations.
     SECTION 5.02
Prevention or Delay in Performance by the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar or the Company.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar, any Transfer Agent, or the Company shall incur any liability to any holder of any Receipt, if by reason of any provision of any present or future law or regulation thereunder of the United States of America or of any other governmental authority or, in the case of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or the Registrar or Transfer Agent, by reason of any provision, present or future, of the Certificate of Incorporation or, in the case of the Company, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar, by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party, the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Company shall be prevented or forbidden from doing or performing any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall be done or performed; nor shall the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, any Registrar or the Company incur any liability to any holder of a Receipt by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall or may be done or performed, or by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 5.03
Obligations of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar and the Company.
     The Company does not assume any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement or any Receipt to holders of Receipts other than from acts or omissions arising out of conduct constituting bad faith, negligence (in the case of any action or inaction with respect to the voting of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock), gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement. Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or
 
Registrar assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to holders of Receipts, the Company or any other person or entity other than for its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Depositary, nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, lost profits, even if such person or entity alleged to be liable has knowledge of the possibility of such damages. Any liability of the Depositary and any Registrar or Transfer Agent under this Deposit Agreement will be limited to the amount of annual fees paid by the Company to the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares or Receipts that in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability, unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information provided by any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent and the Company may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
     In the event the Depositary shall receive conflicting claims, requests or instructions from any holders of Receipts, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, the Depositary shall be entitled to act on such claims, requests or instructions received from the Company, and shall incur no liability and shall be entitled to the full indemnification set forth in Section 5.06 in connection with any action so taken.
     The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action does not result from bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Depositary (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). The Depositary undertakes, and any Registrar or Transfer Agent shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
     The Depositary, its parent, affiliate, or subsidiaries, any Depositary's Agent, and any Registrar or Transfer Agent may own, buy, sell or deal in any class of securities of the Company and its affiliates and in Receipts or Depositary Shares or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company or its affiliates may be interested or contract with or lend money to or otherwise act as fully or as freely as if it were not the Depositary or the Depositary's Agent
 
hereunder. The Depositary may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Company and its affiliates or act in any other capacity for the Company or its affiliates.
     It is intended that neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent shall be deemed to be an "issuer" of the securities under the federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Depositary and any Depositary's Agent are acting only in a ministerial capacity as Depositary for the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock; , , that the Depositary agrees to comply with all information reporting and withholding requirements applicable to it under law or this Deposit Agreement in its capacity as Depositary.
provided
however
     Neither the Depositary (or its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates) nor any Depositary's Agent makes any representation or has any responsibility as to the validity of the registration statement pursuant to which the Depositary Shares are registered under the Securities Act, the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares, the Receipts (except its countersignature thereon) or any instruments referred to therein or herein, or as to the correctness of any statement made therein or herein; , , that the Depositary is responsible for its representations in this Deposit Agreement.
provided
however
     The Company agrees that it will register the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and the Depositary Shares in accordance with the applicable securities laws.
     In the event the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or any Registrar or Transfer Agent believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists in any notice, instruction, direction, request or other communication, paper or document received by it pursuant to this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall promptly notify the Company of the details of such alleged ambiguity or uncertainty, and may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any action, and the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be fully protected and shall incur no liability to any person from refraining from taking such action, absent bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction), unless and until (i) the rights of all parties have been fully and finally adjudicated by a court of appropriate jurisdiction or (ii) the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar receives written instructions with respect to such matter signed by the Company that eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar.
     Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively provided and established by a certificate signed by any one of the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasuer, Head of Corporate Finance, the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar; and such certificate shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar and the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent,
 
Transfer Agent or Registrar shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Deposit Agreement in reliance upon such certificate. The Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Deposit Agreement or in the Receipts (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
     The Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar will not be under any duty or responsibility to ensure compliance with any applicable federal or state securities laws in connection with the issuance, transfer or exchange of the Receipts, Stock or Depositary Shares.
     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment to the Certificate of Designation shall affect the rights, duties, obligations or immunities of the Depositary, Transfer Agent, the Depositary's Agent or Registrar hereunder.
     The Depositary, Transfer Agent and any Registrar hereunder:
          (i) shall have no duties or obligations other than those specifically set forth herein (and no implied duties or obligations), or as may subsequently be agreed to in writing by the parties;
          (ii) shall have no obligation to make payment hereunder unless the Company shall have provided the necessary federal or other immediately available funds or securities or property, as the case may be, to pay in full amounts due and payable with respect thereto;
          (iii) shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder; if, however, the Depositary determines to take any legal or other action hereunder, and, where the taking of such action might in the Depositary's judgment subject or expose it to any expense or liability, the Depositary shall not be required to act unless it shall have been furnished with an indemnity satisfactory to it;
          (iv) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon any certificate, instrument, opinion, notice, letter, facsimile transmission or other document or security delivered to the Depositary and believed by the Depositary to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper party or parties, and shall have no responsibility for determining the accuracy thereof;
          (v) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon the written, telephonic, electronic and oral instructions, with respect to any matter relating to the Depositary's actions as depositary covered by this Deposit Agreement (or supplementing or qualifying any such actions) of officers of the Company;
          (vi) may consult counsel satisfactory to it, and the advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by the Depositary hereunder in accordance with the advice of such counsel;
 
          (vii) shall not be called upon at any time to advise any person with respect to the Depositary Shares or Receipts;
          (viii) shall not be liable or responsible for any recital or statement contained in any documents relating hereto or the Depositary Shares or Receipts; and
          (ix) shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties (other than with respect to the Depositary) executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Deposit Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for under this Deposit Agreement.
     The obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.03 shall survive the replacement, removal or resignation of any Depositary, Registrar, Transfer Agent or Depositary's Agent or termination of this Deposit Agreement.

     SECTION 2.01 .
Form and Transferability of Receipts
     Definitive Receipts shall be printed and shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A annexed to this Deposit Agreement, in each case with appropriate insertions, modifications and omissions, as hereinafter provided. Pending the preparation of definitive Receipts, the Depositary, upon, and pursuant to, the written order of the Company delivered in
 
compliance with Section 2.02 shall be authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver temporary Receipts which shall be substantially of the tenor of the definitive Receipts in lieu of which they are issued and in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the persons executing such Receipts may determine (but which do not affect the rights or duties of the Depositary), as evidenced by their execution of such Receipts. If temporary Receipts are issued, the Company and the Depositary will cause definitive Receipts to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Receipts, the temporary Receipts shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts upon surrender of the temporary Receipts at the Depositary Office without charge to the holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Receipts, the Depositary is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver in exchange therefor definitive Receipts representing the same number of Depositary Shares as represented by the surrendered temporary Receipt or Receipts. Such exchange shall be made at the Company's expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Receipts shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Deposit Agreement, and with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited, as definitive Receipts.
     Receipts shall be executed by the Depositary by the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Depositary; , that if a Registrar for the Receipts (other than the Depositary) shall have been appointed then such Receipts shall also be countersigned by manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Registrar. No Receipt shall be entitled to any benefits under this Deposit Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless it shall have been executed as provided in the preceding sentence. The Depositary shall record on its books each Receipt executed as provided above and delivered as hereinafter provided. Receipts bearing the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Depositary who was at any time a proper signatory of the Depositary shall bind the Depositary, notwithstanding that such signatory ceased to hold such office prior to the execution and delivery of such Receipts by the Registrar or did not hold such office on the date of issuance of such Receipts.
provided
     Receipts shall be in denominations of any number of whole Depositary Shares. All Receipts shall be dated the date of their issuance.
     Receipts may be endorsed with or have incorporated in the text thereof such legends or recitals or changes not inconsistent with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement as may be required by the Depositary and approved by the Company, or which the Company has determined are required to comply with any applicable law or regulation or with the rules and regulations of any securities exchange upon which the Depositary Shares may be listed for trading or to conform with any usage with respect thereto, or to indicate any special limitations or restrictions to which any particular Receipts are subject, in each case as directed by the Company.
     Title to any Receipt (and to the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt) that is properly endorsed, or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer, or endorsement shall be transferable by delivery with the same effect as in the case of a negotiable instrument; , , that until transfer of a Receipt shall be registered on the books of the Depositary as provided in Section 2.04, the Depositary may, notwithstanding any notice to
provided
however
 
the contrary, treat the record holder thereof at such time as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of determining the person entitled to distributions of dividends or other distributions or payments with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock, to exercise any redemption, voting, or conversion rights or to receive any notice provided for in this Deposit Agreement and for all other purposes.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request by the Company, the Depositary and the Company will make application to DTC for acceptance of all or a portion of the Receipts for its book-entry settlement system. In connection with any such request, the Company hereby appoints the Depositary acting through any authorized officer thereof as its attorney-in-fact, with full power to delegate, for purposes of executing any agreements, certifications or other instruments or documents necessary or desirable in order to effect the acceptance of such Receipts for DTC eligibility. So long as the Receipts are eligible for book-entry settlement with DTC, unless otherwise required by law, all Depositary Shares to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange with book-entry settlement through DTC shall be represented by a single receipt (the "DTC Receipt"), which shall be deposited with DTC (or its custodian) evidencing all such Depositary Shares and registered in the name of the nominee of DTC (initially expected to be Cede & Co.). The Depositary or such other entity as is agreed to by DTC may hold the DTC Receipt as custodian for DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in the DTC Receipt shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected through, records maintained by (i) DTC or its nominee for such DTC Receipt, or (ii) institutions that have accounts with DTC.
     If issued, the DTC Receipt shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts only if (i) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue to make its book-entry settlement system available for the Receipts and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing, (ii) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under applicable law and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing or (iii) the Company executes and delivers to DTC a notice to the effect that such DTC Receipt shall be so exchangeable. If the beneficial owners of interests in Depositary Shares are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Receipts as the result of an event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such beneficial interests may be so exchanged, the Depositary is hereby directed to and shall provide written instructions to DTC to deliver to the Depositary for cancellation the DTC Receipt, and the Company shall instruct the Depositary in writing to execute and deliver to the beneficial owners of the Depositary Shares previously evidenced by the DTC Receipt definitive Receipts in physical form evidencing such Depositary Shares. The DTC Receipt shall be in such form and shall bear such legend or legends as may be appropriate or required by DTC in order for it to accept the Depositary Shares for its book-entry settlement system. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, if the Receipts are at any time eligible for book-entry settlement through DTC, delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and other property in connection with the withdrawal, redemption or conversion of Depositary Shares will be made through DTC and in accordance with its procedures, unless the holder of the relevant Receipt otherwise requests and such request is reasonably acceptable to the Depositary and the Company.

Deposit of Convertible Preferred Stock; Execution and Delivery of Receipts in Respect Thereof.
     Concurrently with the execution of this Deposit Agreement, the Company is delivering to the Depositary a certificate or certificates, registered in the name of the Depositary and evidencing 8,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, properly endorsed or accompanied, if required by the Depositary, by a duly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement, in form satisfactory to the Depositary, together with (i) all such certifications as may be required by the Depositary in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement and (ii) a written order of the Company directing the Depositary to execute and deliver to, or upon the written order of, the person or persons stated in such order a Receipt or Receipts for the Depositary Shares representing such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock registered in such names specified in such written order. The Depositary acknowledges receipt of the aforementioned 8,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and related documentation and agrees to hold such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock in an account to be established by the Depositary at the Depositary Office or at such other office as the Depositary shall determine. The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder and The Bank of New York hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, will reflect changes in the number of shares (including any fractional shares) of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock held by it by notation, book-entry or other appropriate method.
     If required by the Depositary, Convertible Preferred Stock presented for deposit by the Company at any time, whether or not the register of stockholders of the Company is closed, shall also be accompanied by an agreement or assignment, or other instrument satisfactory to the Depositary, that will provide for the prompt transfer to the Depositary or its nominee of any dividend or right to subscribe for additional Convertible Preferred Stock or to receive other property that any person in whose name the Convertible Preferred Stock is or has been registered may thereafter receive upon or in respect of such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or in lieu thereof such agreement of indemnity or other agreement as shall be satisfactory to the Depositary.
     Upon receipt by the Depositary of a certificate or certificates for Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder, together with the other documents specified above, and upon registering such Convertible Preferred Stock in the name of the Depositary, the Depositary, subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, shall execute and deliver to, or upon the order of, the person or persons named in the written order delivered to the Depositary referred to in the first paragraph of this Section 2.02, a Receipt or Receipts for the number of whole Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock so deposited and registered in such name or names as may be requested by such person or persons. The Depositary shall execute and deliver such Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of any person requesting such delivery, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such person. Other than in the case of splits, combinations or other reclassifications affecting the Convertible Preferred Stock, or in the case of dividends or other distributions of Convertible Preferred Stock, if any, there shall be deposited hereunder not more than the number of shares constituting the Convertible Preferred Stock as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, as such may be amended. To the extent that the Company issues shares of Convertible Preferred Stock in excess of the amount set forth in the Certificate of Designation as of the date hereof
 
(which shares have been validly authorized by the Company), the Company shall notify the Depositary of such issuance in writing.
     The Company shall deliver to the Depositary from time to time such quantities of Receipts as the Depositary may request to enable the Depositary to perform its obligations under this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 2.03
Optional Redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock for Cash.
     Whenever the Company shall elect to redeem shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock for cash in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, it shall (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Depositary) give the Depositary not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior written notice of the date fixed for redemption of such Convertible Preferred Stock (the "redemption date") and of the number of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by the Depositary to be redeemed and the applicable redemption price (the "redemption price"), as set forth in the Certificate of Designation. The Depositary shall mail, first-class postage prepaid, notice of the redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock and the proposed simultaneous redemption of the Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to the holders of record on the record date fixed for such redemption pursuant to Section 4.04 of the Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed, at the addresses of such holders as the same appear on the records of the Depositary; but neither the failure to mail any such notice to one or more such holder nor any defect in any such notice shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for redemption except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given.
     The Company shall prepare and provide the Depositary with such notice, and each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be redeemed; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed; (v) the place or places where the Convertible Preferred Stock and the Receipts evidencing Depositary Shares to be redeemed are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (vi) that on the redemption date dividends in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue.
     In the event that notice of redemption has been made as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs and the Company shall then have paid in full to the Depositary the redemption price (determined pursuant to the Certificate of Designation) of the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary to be redeemed, the Depositary shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Convertible Preferred Stock so called for redemption by the Company and on the redemption date (unless the Company shall have failed to pay for the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed by it as set forth in the Company's notice provided for in the preceding paragraph), all dividends in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock called for redemption shall cease to accrue, the Depositary Shares called for redemption shall be deemed no longer to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (except the right to receive the redemption price) shall, to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate. Upon surrender in accordance
 
with said notice of the Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Depositary shall so require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed at a cash redemption price of $50 per Depositary Share plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the redemption date. The foregoing shall be further subject to the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Deposit Agreement and the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, the provisions of the Certificate of Designation will govern and the Company will instruct the Depositary in writing accordingly of such governing terms; , , that under no circumstances will the Certificate of Designation be deemed to change or modify any of the rights, duties or immunities of the Depositary contained herein.
provided
however
     If fewer than all of the Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt are called for redemption, the Depositary will deliver to the holder of such Receipt upon its surrender to the Depositary, together with payment of the redemption price for and all other amounts payable in respect of the Depositary Shares called for redemption, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares evidenced by such prior Receipt and not called for redemption.
     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemed pursuant to the Company's exercise of its optional redemption right, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be redeemed pursuant to this Section 2.03 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable.
     SECTION 2.04
Registration of Transfers of Receipts.
     The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Receipts and The Bank of New York hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, shall register on its books from time to time transfers of Receipts upon any surrender thereof by the holder in person or by a duly authorized attorney, agent or representative properly endorsed or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement, together with evidence of the payment by the applicable party of any transfer taxes as may be required by law.

Shares by surrendering such Receipt or Receipts to the Depositary or at such other office as the Depositary may designate for such withdrawals; , that a holder of a Receipt or Receipts may not withdraw such Convertible Preferred Stock (or money and other property, if any, represented thereby) which has previously been called for redemption.

If the Receipt or Receipts delivered by the holder to the Depositary in connection with such withdrawal shall evidence a number of Depositary Shares in excess of the number of Depositary Shares representing the number of whole shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock to be withdrawn, the Depositary shall at the same time, in addition to such number of whole shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and such money and other property, if any, to be withdrawn, deliver to such holder, or (subject to Section 2.04) upon his order, a new Receipt or Receipts evidencing such excess number of Depositary Shares. Delivery of such Convertible Preferred Stock and such money and other property being withdrawn may be made by the delivery of such certificates, documents of title and other instruments as the Depositary may deem appropriate, which, if required by the Depositary, shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer.

     SECTION 2.07
Limitations on Execution and Delivery, Transfer, Split-up. Combination, Surrender and Exchange of Receipts.

     SECTION 2.10
Conversion at the Option of Holders.
     Subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement and the Certificate of Designation, Receipts may be surrendered at any time by the holders thereof with written instructions to the Depositary instructing it to convert any specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipts into shares of Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock) in accordance with the Certificate of Designation. Depositary shares may be converted at the option of the holders only in lots of 1,000 Depositary Shares or integral multiples thereof.
     On the date of any conversion at the option of the holders, a holder of a Receipt shall surrender such Receipt at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly
 
completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipt to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent, thereby instructing the Depositary to cause the conversion of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt specified in such notice of conversion into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on a Dividend Record Date for any declared dividend for the then-current Dividend Period, but prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date or any holder of Receipts surrendered with instructions to the Depositary for conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipts an amount of funds equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date
 
computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
     In the event that optional conversion is elected by a holder of a surrendered Receipt with respect to less than all Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.10 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.

If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition or a Fundamental Change, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of
 
Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company (or cash in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 10(c) of the Certificate of Designation) and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date with respect to any dividend payment on the Convertible Preferred Stock and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, any holder of Receipts surrendered with instructions to the Depositary for conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipts an amount of funds equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
     In the event that Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion or, if applicable, a Fundamental Change conversion is elected by a holder with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.11 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     SECTION 2.12
Conversion at the Option of the Company.
     In connection with any conversion at the option of the Company in accordance with the Certificate of Designation, the Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) to the Depositary stating that it has complied with all of the conditions to the exercise of its optional conversion rights set forth in the Certificate of
 
Designation, and the Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to inquire or investigate whether the Company has complied with the terms of the Certificate of Designation.
     If the Company exercises such conversion right, it shall provide written notice of such conversion to the Depositary stating, in addition to any information required by applicable law or regulation, (i) the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock; and (iii) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted; (iv) if fewer than all shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be converted, the number of such shares held by such holder to be so converted; (v) the place or places where the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted are to be surrendered for conversion.
     Upon receipt of such notice, the Depositary shall as promptly as practicable provide notice of the Company's exercise of such conversion right to each holder of Receipts, which notice shall be prepared by the Company and sent to the Depositary and shall state (i) the Conversion at the Option of the Company Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock (and Depositary Share); (iii) the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be converted; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be converted, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so converted; (v) the place or places where the Depositary Shares to be converted are to be surrendered for conversion.
     On the date of any conversion at the option of the Company, a holder of a Receipt must surrender such Receipt at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipt to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt in connection with a conversion at the option of the Company, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
 
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) subject to the next succeeding sentence, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     In the event that conversion at the option of the Company is effected with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.12 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is converted pursuant to a conversion at the option of the Company, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be converted pursuant to this Section 2.12 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable. If the Conversion Agent selects a portion of a holder's Depositary Shares for partial conversion at the option of the Company and the holder converts a portion of the same share of Depositary Shares, the converted portion will be deemed to be from the portion selected for conversion.
     SECTION 2.13
Fractional Shares.
     No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued to a holder of the Depositary Shares upon conversion. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable, the holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock, calculated on an aggregate basis in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted, multiplied by the Closing Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) of the Common Stock on the trading day (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) immediately preceding the applicable conversion date, which shall be paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether the amounts of funds paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion are correct.
 
     SECTION 2.14
No Pre-Release
     The Depositary shall not deliver any deposited Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by Receipts prior to the receipt and cancellation of such Receipts or other similar method used with respect to Receipts held by DTC. The Depositary shall not issue any Receipts prior to the receipt by the Depositary of the corresponding Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by such Receipts. At no time will any Receipts be outstanding if such Receipts do not represent Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary.
     SECTION 3.01
Filing Proofs, Certificates and Other Information.
     Any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file with the Depositary such proof of residence, guarantee of signature or other information and to execute such certificates as the Depositary may reasonably deem necessary or proper or the Company may reasonably require by written request to the Depositary. The Depositary or the Company may withhold or delay the delivery of any Receipt, the transfer, redemption or exchange of any Receipt, the withdrawal of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by any Receipt, the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof, until such proof or other information is filed, or such certificates are executed.
     SECTION 3.02
Payment of Fees and Expenses.
     Holders of Receipts shall be obligated to make payments to the Depositary of certain fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges to the extent provided in Section 5.07, or provide evidence satisfactory to the Depositary that such fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges have been paid. Until such payment is made, transfer of any Receipt or any withdrawal of the Convertible Preferred Stock or money or other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be refused, any dividend or other distribution may be withheld, and any part or all of the Convertible Preferred Stock or other property represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be sold for the account of the holder thereof (after attempting by reasonable means to notify such holder a reasonable number of days prior to such sale). Any dividend or other distribution so withheld and the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such fees or expenses, the holder of such Receipt remaining liable for any deficiency.
     SECTION 3.03
Representations and Warranties as to Convertible Preferred Stock.
     In the case of the initial deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock hereunder, the Company represents and warrants that such Convertible Preferred Stock and each certificate therefor are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Such representations and warranties shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts.
 
     SECTION 3.04
Representation and Warranty as to Receipts and Depositary Shares.
     The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will evidence legal and valid interests in the Depositary Shares and each Depositary Share will represent a legal and valid 1/1,000 fractional interest in a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Share. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares.
th
     SECTION 3.05
Taxes.
     The Company will pay any and all stock transfer, documentary, stamp and similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of Depositary Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Depositary Shares or certificates representing such shares or securities. The Company will not, however, be required to pay any such tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, shares of Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in which the Depositary Shares with respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment to any person other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and will not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
     SECTION 4.01
Cash Distributions.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, including any cash received upon redemption of any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.03, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of such sum as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders; , , that in case the Company or the Depositary shall be required by law to and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Receipts held by any holder an amount on account of taxes or as otherwise required by law, regulation or court process, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares represented by such Receipts subject to such withholding shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary, however, shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Receipts a fraction of one cent. Any such fractional amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent and so distributed to registered holders entitled thereto and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for
provided
however
 
interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next succeeding distribution to record holders of such Receipts. Each holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with a properly completed Form W-8 (i.e., Form W-8BEN, Form W-8EXP, Form W-8IMY, Form W8ECI or another applicable Form W-8) or Form W-9 (which form shall set forth such holder's certified taxpayer identification number if requested on such form), as may be applicable. Each holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distribution to be made hereunder.
     SECTION 4.02
Distributions Other Than Cash.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Depositary and the Company may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of securities to the holders of Receipts unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such securities have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
     SECTION 4.03
Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
     If the Company shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names deposited Convertible Preferred Stock is registered on the books of the Company any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts in such manner as the Company shall instruct (including by the issue to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges); , , that (a) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Company determines upon advice of its legal counsel that it is not lawful or feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to the holders of Receipts (by the issue of warrants or otherwise) or (b) if and to the extent instructed by holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, the Depositary shall then, if so directed by the Company and provided with an opinion of counsel that if Depositary undertakes such actions it will not be deemed an "issuer" under the Securities Act or an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges so permit, sell such rights, preferences or privileges of such holders at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Section 3.01 and Section 3.02, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.01 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of such rights, preferences or privileges, unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such rights, preferences or privileges have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
provided
however
 
     If registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement that it will promptly file a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such a registration statement shall have become effective or unless the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act and the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to such effect.
     If any other action under the law of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
     The Depositary will not be deemed to have any knowledge of any item for which it is supposed to receive notification under any Section of this Deposit Agreement unless and until it has received such notification.
     SECTION 4.04
Notice of Dividends; Fixing of Record Date for Holders of Receipts.
     Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable, any distribution other than cash shall be made, or any rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of (i) any meeting at which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to notice or (ii) any election on the part of the Company to redeem any shares of such Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting or to receive notice of such meeting or whose Depositary Shares are to be so redeemed.
     SECTION 4.05
Voting Rights.
     Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice, which shall be provided by the Company and which
 
shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting, (ii) a statement that the holders of Receipts at the close of business on a specified record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 will be entitled, subject to any applicable provision of law, to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares and (iii) a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of a holder of a Receipt on such record date, the Depositary shall insofar as practicable vote or cause to be voted the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request. To the extent any such instructions request the voting of a fractional interest of a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall aggregate such interest with all other fractional interests resulting from requests with the same voting instructions and shall vote the number of whole votes resulting from such aggregation in accordance with the instructions received in such requests. Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote and, accordingly, each Depositary Share is entitled to 1/1000 of a vote. The Company hereby agrees to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Convertible Preferred Stock or cause such Convertible Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will vote all Depositary Shares held by it in proportion with any instructions received. The Depositary shall not exercise any discretion in voting any Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.

Changes Affecting Convertible Preferred Stock and Reorganization Events.
     Upon any change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Convertible Preferred Stock, any Reorganization Event or any exchange of the Convertible Preferred Stock for cash, securities or other property, the Depositary shall, upon the written instructions of the Company setting forth any of the following adjustments, (i) reflect such adjustments in the Depositary's books and records in (a) the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Convertible Preferred Stock and (b) the ratio of the redemption price and the conversion rate per Depositary Share to the redemption price and the conversion rate, respectively, of a share of Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case as may be required by or as is consistent with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation to fully reflect the effects of such change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Convertible Preferred Stock, of such Reorganization Event or of such exchange and (ii) treat any shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) that shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock as new deposited property under this Deposit Agreement, and Receipts then outstanding shall thenceforth represent the proportionate interests of holders thereof in the new deposited property so received in exchange for or in respect of such Convertible Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may, upon the receipt of written request of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts, or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited property.
 
     SECTION 4.07
Inspection of Reports.
     The Depositary shall make available for inspection by holders of Receipts at the Depositary Office and at such other places as it may from time to time deem advisable during normal business hours any reports and communications received from the Company that are both received by the Depositary as the holder of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and made generally available to the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Depositary shall transmit, upon written request by the Company, certain notices and reports to the holders of Receipts as provided in Section 5.05.
     SECTION 4.08
Lists of Receipt Holders.
     Promptly upon request from time to time by the Company, the Registrar shall furnish to the Company a list, as of a recent date specified by the Company, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary Shares of all persons in whose names Receipts are registered on the books of the Registrar.
     SECTION 4.09
Withholding.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Deposit Agreement, in the event that the Depositary determines that any distribution in property is subject to any tax or other governmental charge which the Depositary is obligated by law to withhold, the Depositary may dispose of, by public or private sale, all or a portion of such property in such amounts and in such manner as the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay such taxes, and the Depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of any such sale or the balance of any such property after deduction of such taxes to the holders of Receipts entitled thereto in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares held by them, respectively; , , that in the event the Depositary determines that such distribution of property is subject to withholding tax only with respect to some but not all holders of Receipts, the Depositary will use its best efforts (i) to sell only that portion of such property distributable to such holders that is required to generate sufficient proceeds to pay such withholding tax and (ii) to effect any such sale in such a manner so as to avoid affecting the rights of any other holders of Receipts to receive such distribution in property; , that with respect to a holder of Receipts that is a state governmental entity, before withholding and paying over to any U.S. federal, state or local tax authority any amount purportedly representing a tax liability of such holder pursuant to the Deposit Agreement or as a holder of the Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary or the Company or both will provide such holder (i) an explanation of the reasons such withholding and payment is required by law, or (ii) a copy of any written notice of the claim of any U.S. tax authority received by the Depositary or the Company that such withholding and payment is required by law and provide such holder the opportunity to contest such claim during any permitted period, such contest by such holder does not subject the Depositary and/or the Company to any potential liability to such taxing authority of any such claimed withholding and payment.

The Company may cause the Registrar to close such books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.
     If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or any other stock exchange, the Depositary may, with the written approval of the Company, appoint a registrar (acceptable to the Company) for registration of such Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with the requirements of such exchange. Such registrar (which may be the Registrar if so permitted by the requirements of such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar appointed by the Registrar upon the request or with the written approval of the Company. If the Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock are listed on one or more other stock exchanges, the Registrar will, at the request and expense of the Company, arrange such facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender, redemption and exchange of such Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock as may be required by law or applicable stock exchange regulations.

provide shall or may be done or performed, or by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 5.03
Obligations of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar and the Company.
     The Company does not assume any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement or any Receipt to holders of Receipts other than from acts or omissions arising out of conduct constituting bad faith, negligence (in the case of any action or inaction with respect to the voting of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock), gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement. Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or Registrar assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to holders of Receipts, the Company or any other person or entity other than for its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Depositary, nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, lost profits, even if such person or entity alleged to be liable has knowledge of the possibility of such damages. Any liability of the Depositary and any Registrar or Transfer Agent under this Deposit Agreement will be limited to the amount of annual fees paid by the Company to the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares or Receipts that in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability, unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information provided by any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent and the Company may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
     In the event the Depositary shall receive conflicting claims, requests or instructions from any holders of Receipts, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, the Depositary shall be entitled to act on such claims, requests or instructions received from the Company, and shall incur no liability and shall be entitled to the full indemnification set forth in Section 5.06 in connection with any action so taken.
     The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action does not result from bad faith, gross negligence or
 
willful misconduct of the Depositary (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction).

The Depositary may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Company and its affiliates or act in any other capacity for the Company or its affiliates.
     It is intended that neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent shall be deemed to be an "issuer" of the securities under the federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Depositary and any Depositary's Agent are acting only in a ministerial capacity as Depositary for the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock; , , that the Depositary agrees to comply with all information reporting and withholding requirements applicable to it under law or this Deposit Agreement in its capacity as Depositary.

the contrary, treat the record holder thereof at such time as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of determining the person entitled to distributions of dividends or other distributions or payments with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock, to exercise any redemption, voting, or conversion rights or to receive any notice provided for in this Deposit Agreement and for all other purposes.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request by the Company, the Depositary and the Company will make application to DTC for acceptance of all or a portion of the Receipts for its book-entry settlement system. In connection with any such request, the Company hereby appoints the Depositary acting through any authorized officer thereof as its attorney-in-fact, with full power to delegate, for purposes of executing any agreements, certifications or other instruments or documents necessary or desirable in order to effect the acceptance of such Receipts for DTC eligibility. So long as the Receipts are eligible for book-entry settlement with DTC, unless otherwise required by law, all Depositary Shares to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange with book-entry settlement through DTC shall be represented by a single receipt (the "DTC Receipt"), which shall be deposited with DTC (or its custodian) evidencing all such Depositary Shares and registered in the name of the nominee of DTC (initially expected to be Cede & Co.). The Depositary or such other entity as is agreed to by DTC may hold the DTC Receipt as custodian for DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in the DTC Receipt shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected through, records maintained by (i) DTC or its nominee for such DTC Receipt, or (ii) institutions that have accounts with DTC.
     If issued, the DTC Receipt shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts only if (i) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue to make its book-entry settlement system available for the Receipts and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing, (ii) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under applicable law and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing or (iii) the Company executes and delivers to DTC a notice to the effect that such DTC Receipt shall be so exchangeable. If the beneficial owners of interests in Depositary Shares are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Receipts as the result of an event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such beneficial interests may be so exchanged, the Depositary is hereby directed to and shall provide written instructions to DTC to deliver to the Depositary for cancellation the DTC Receipt, and the Company shall instruct the Depositary in writing to execute and deliver to the beneficial owners of the Depositary Shares previously evidenced by the DTC Receipt definitive Receipts in physical form evidencing such Depositary Shares. The DTC Receipt shall be in such form and shall bear such legend or legends as may be appropriate or required by DTC in order for it to accept the Depositary Shares for its book-entry settlement system. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, if the Receipts are at any time eligible for book-entry settlement through DTC, delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and other property in connection with the withdrawal, redemption or conversion of Depositary Shares will be made through DTC and in accordance with its procedures, unless the holder of the relevant Receipt otherwise requests and such request is reasonably acceptable to the Depositary and the Company.

     Concurrently with the execution of this Deposit Agreement, the Company is delivering to the Depositary a certificate or certificates, registered in the name of the Depositary and evidencing 100 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, properly endorsed or accompanied, if required by the Depositary, by a duly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement, in form satisfactory to the Depositary, together with (i) all such certifications as may be required by the Depositary in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement and (ii) a written order of the Company directing the Depositary to execute and deliver to, or upon the written order of, the person or persons stated in such order a Receipt or Receipts for the Depositary Shares representing such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock registered in such names specified in such written order. The Depositary acknowledges receipt of the aforementioned 100 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and related documentation and agrees to hold such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock in an account to be established by the Depositary at the Depositary Office or at such other office as the Depositary shall determine. The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder and The Bank of New York hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, will reflect changes in the number of shares (including any fractional shares) of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock held by it by notation, book-entry or other appropriate method.
     If required by the Depositary, Convertible Preferred Stock presented for deposit by the Company at any time, whether or not the register of stockholders of the Company is closed, shall also be accompanied by an agreement or assignment, or other instrument satisfactory to the Depositary, that will provide for the prompt transfer to the Depositary or its nominee of any dividend or right to subscribe for additional Convertible Preferred Stock or to receive other property that any person in whose name the Convertible Preferred Stock is or has been registered may thereafter receive upon or in respect of such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or in lieu thereof such agreement of indemnity or other agreement as shall be satisfactory to the Depositary.
     Upon receipt by the Depositary of a certificate or certificates for Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder, together with the other documents specified above, and upon registering such Convertible Preferred Stock in the name of the Depositary, the Depositary, subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, shall execute and deliver to, or upon the order of, the person or persons named in the written order delivered to the Depositary referred to in the first paragraph of this Section 2.02, a Receipt or Receipts for the number of whole Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock so deposited and registered in such name or names as may be requested by such person or persons. The Depositary shall execute and deliver such Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of any person requesting such delivery, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such person. Other than in the case of splits, combinations or other reclassifications affecting the Convertible Preferred Stock, or in the case of dividends or other distributions of Convertible Preferred Stock, if any, there shall be deposited hereunder not more than the number of shares constituting the Convertible Preferred Stock as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, as such may be amended. To the extent that the Company issues shares of Convertible Preferred Stock in excess of the amount set forth in the Certificate of Designation as of the date hereof
 
(which shares have been validly authorized by the Company), the Company shall notify the Depositary of such issuance in writing.
     The Company shall deliver to the Depositary from time to time such quantities of Receipts as the Depositary may request to enable the Depositary to perform its obligations under this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 2.03
Optional Redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock for Cash.
     Whenever the Company shall elect to redeem shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock for cash in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, it shall (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Depositary) give the Depositary not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior written notice of the date fixed for redemption of such Convertible Preferred Stock (the "redemption date") and of the number of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by the Depositary to be redeemed and the applicable redemption price (the "redemption price"), as set forth in the Certificate of Designation. The Depositary shall mail, first-class postage prepaid, notice of the redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock and the proposed simultaneous redemption of the Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to the holders of record on the record date fixed for such redemption pursuant to Section 4.04 of the Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed, at the addresses of such holders as the same appear on the records of the Depositary; but neither the failure to mail any such notice to one or more such holder nor any defect in any such notice shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for redemption except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given.
     The Company shall prepare and provide the Depositary with such notice, and each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be redeemed; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed; (v) the place or places where the Convertible Preferred Stock and the Receipts evidencing Depositary Shares to be redeemed are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (vi) that on the redemption date dividends in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue.
     In the event that notice of redemption has been made as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs and the Company shall then have paid in full to the Depositary the redemption price (determined pursuant to the Certificate of Designation) of the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary to be redeemed, the Depositary shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Convertible Preferred Stock so called for redemption by the Company and on the redemption date (unless the Company shall have failed to pay for the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed by it as set forth in the Company's notice provided for in the preceding paragraph), all dividends in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock called for redemption shall cease to accrue, the Depositary Shares called for redemption shall be deemed no longer to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (except the right to receive the redemption price) shall, to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate. Upon surrender in accordance
 
with said notice of the Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Depositary shall so require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed at a cash redemption price of $50 per Depositary Share plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the redemption date. The foregoing shall be further subject to the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Deposit Agreement and the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, the provisions of the Certificate of Designation will govern and the Company will instruct the Depositary in writing accordingly of such governing terms; , , that under no circumstances will the Certificate of Designation be deemed to change or modify any of the rights, duties or immunities of the Depositary contained herein.
provided
however
     If fewer than all of the Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt are called for redemption, the Depositary will deliver to the holder of such Receipt upon its surrender to the Depositary, together with payment of the redemption price for and all other amounts payable in respect of the Depositary Shares called for redemption, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares evidenced by such prior Receipt and not called for redemption.
     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemed pursuant to the Company's exercise of its optional redemption right, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be redeemed pursuant to this Section 2.03 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable.
     SECTION 2.04
Registration of Transfers of Receipts.
     The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Receipts and The Bank of New York hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, shall register on its books from time to time transfers of Receipts upon any surrender thereof by the holder in person or by a duly authorized attorney, agent or representative properly endorsed or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement, together with evidence of the payment by the applicable party of any transfer taxes as may be required by law.

Shares by surrendering such Receipt or Receipts to the Depositary or at such other office as the Depositary may designate for such withdrawals; , that a holder of a Receipt or Receipts may not withdraw such Convertible Preferred Stock (or money and other property, if any, represented thereby) which has previously been called for redemption. Upon such surrender, upon payment of the fee of the Depositary for the surrender of Receipts to the extent provided in Section 5.07 and payment of all taxes and governmental charges in connection with such surrender and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, without unreasonable delay, the Depositary shall deliver to such holder, or to the person or persons designated by such holder as hereinafter provided, the number of whole shares of such Convertible Preferred Stock and all such money and other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipt or Receipts so surrendered for withdrawal, but holders of such whole shares of Convertible Preferred Stock will not thereafter be entitled to deposit such Convertible Preferred Stock hereunder or to receive Depositary Shares therefor. If the Receipt or Receipts delivered by the holder to the Depositary in connection with such withdrawal shall evidence a number of Depositary Shares in excess of the number of Depositary Shares representing the number of whole shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock to be withdrawn, the Depositary shall at the same time, in addition to such number of whole shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and such money and other property, if any, to be withdrawn, deliver to such holder, or (subject to Section 2.04) upon his order, a new Receipt or Receipts evidencing such excess number of Depositary Shares.

     SECTION 2.07
Limitations on Execution and Delivery, Transfer, Split-up. Combination, Surrender and Exchange of Receipts.

thereto (including any such tax or charge with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock being deposited or withdrawn); (ii) the production of proof satisfactory to it as to the identity and genuineness of any signature (or the authority of any signature); and (iii) compliance with such regulations, if any, as the Depositary or the Company may establish consistent with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement as may be required by any securities exchange on which the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares or the Receipts may be included for quotation or listed.

     Subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement and the Certificate of Designation, Receipts may be surrendered at any time by the holders thereof with written instructions to the Depositary instructing it to convert any specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipts into shares of Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock) in accordance with the Certificate of Designation. Depositary shares may be converted at the option of the holders only in lots of 1,000 Depositary Shares or integral multiples thereof.
     On the date of any conversion at the option of the holders, a holder of a Receipt shall surrender such Receipt at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly
 
completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipt to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent, thereby instructing the Depositary to cause the conversion of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt specified in such notice of conversion into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on a Dividend Record Date for any declared dividend for the then-current Dividend Period, but prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date or any holder of Receipts surrendered with instructions to the Depositary for conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipts an amount of funds equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date
 
computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
     In the event that optional conversion is elected by a holder of a surrendered Receipt with respect to less than all Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.10 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.

If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition or a Fundamental Change, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of
 
Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company (or cash in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 10(c) of the Certificate of Designation) and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     If Receipts are surrendered to the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date with respect to any dividend payment on the Convertible Preferred Stock and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, any holder of Receipts surrendered with instructions to the Depositary for conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented thereby shall remit to the Depositary with such Receipts an amount of funds equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder.

     In the event that Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion or, if applicable, a Fundamental Change conversion is elected by a holder with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.11 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     SECTION 2.12
Conversion at the Option of the Company.
     In connection with any conversion at the option of the Company in accordance with the Certificate of Designation, the Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) to the Depositary stating that it has complied with all of the conditions to the exercise of its optional conversion rights set forth in the Certificate of

Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt in connection with a conversion at the option of the Company, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
 
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) subject to the next succeeding sentence, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.
     In the event that conversion at the option of the Company is effected with respect to less than all Depositary Shares as evidenced by a surrendered Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.12 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is converted pursuant to a conversion at the option of the Company, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be converted pursuant to this Section 2.12 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable. If the Conversion Agent selects a portion of a holder's Depositary Shares for partial conversion at the option of the Company and the holder converts a portion of the same share of Depositary Shares, the converted portion will be deemed to be from the portion selected for conversion.
     SECTION 2.13
Fractional Shares.
     No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued to a holder of the Depositary Shares upon conversion. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable, the holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock, calculated on an aggregate basis in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted, multiplied by the Closing Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) of the Common Stock on the trading day (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) immediately preceding the applicable conversion date, which shall be paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether the amounts of funds paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion are correct.
 
     SECTION 2.14
No Pre-Release
     The Depositary shall not deliver any deposited Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by Receipts prior to the receipt and cancellation of such Receipts or other similar method used with respect to Receipts held by DTC. The Depositary shall not issue any Receipts prior to the receipt by the Depositary of the corresponding Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by such Receipts. At no time will any Receipts be outstanding if such Receipts do not represent Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary.
     SECTION 3.01
Filing Proofs, Certificates and Other Information.
     Any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt may be required from time to time to file with the Depositary such proof of residence, guarantee of signature or other information and to execute such certificates as the Depositary may reasonably deem necessary or proper or the Company may reasonably require by written request to the Depositary. The Depositary or the Company may withhold or delay the delivery of any Receipt, the transfer, redemption or exchange of any Receipt, the withdrawal of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by any Receipt, the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof, until such proof or other information is filed, or such certificates are executed.
     SECTION 3.02
Payment of Fees and Expenses.
     Holders of Receipts shall be obligated to make payments to the Depositary of certain fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges to the extent provided in Section 5.07, or provide evidence satisfactory to the Depositary that such fees and expenses and taxes or other governmental charges have been paid. Until such payment is made, transfer of any Receipt or any withdrawal of the Convertible Preferred Stock or money or other property, if any, represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be refused, any dividend or other distribution may be withheld, and any part or all of the Convertible Preferred Stock or other property represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt may be sold for the account of the holder thereof (after attempting by reasonable means to notify such holder a reasonable number of days prior to such sale). Any dividend or other distribution so withheld and the proceeds of any such sale may be applied to any payment of such fees or expenses, the holder of such Receipt remaining liable for any deficiency.
     SECTION 3.03
Representations and Warranties as to Convertible Preferred Stock.
     In the case of the initial deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock hereunder, the Company represents and warrants that such Convertible Preferred Stock and each certificate therefor are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Such representations and warranties shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts.
 
     SECTION 3.04
Representation and Warranty as to Receipts and Depositary Shares.
     The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will evidence legal and valid interests in the Depositary Shares and each Depositary Share will represent a legal and valid 1/1,000 fractional interest in a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Share. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares.
th
     SECTION 3.05
Taxes.
     The Company will pay any and all stock transfer, documentary, stamp and similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of Depositary Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Depositary Shares or certificates representing such shares or securities. The Company will not, however, be required to pay any such tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, shares of Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in which the Depositary Shares with respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment to any person other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and will not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
     SECTION 4.01
Cash Distributions.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, including any cash received upon redemption of any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.03, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of such sum as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders; , , that in case the Company or the Depositary shall be required by law to and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Receipts held by any holder an amount on account of taxes or as otherwise required by law, regulation or court process, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares represented by such Receipts subject to such withholding shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary, however, shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Receipts a fraction of one cent. Any such fractional amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent and so distributed to registered holders entitled thereto and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for
provided
however
 
interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next succeeding distribution to record holders of such Receipts. Each holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with a properly completed Form W-8 (i.e., Form W-8BEN, Form W-8EXP, Form W-8IMY, Form W8ECI or another applicable Form W-8) or Form W-9 (which form shall set forth such holder's certified taxpayer identification number if requested on such form), as may be applicable. Each holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distribution to be made hereunder.
     SECTION 4.02
Distributions Other Than Cash.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Depositary and the Company may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of securities to the holders of Receipts unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such securities have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
     SECTION 4.03
Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
     If the Company shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names deposited Convertible Preferred Stock is registered on the books of the Company any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts in such manner as the Company shall instruct (including by the issue to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges); , , that (a) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Company determines upon advice of its legal counsel that it is not lawful or feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to the holders of Receipts (by the issue of warrants or otherwise) or (b) if and to the extent instructed by holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, the Depositary shall then, if so directed by the Company and provided with an opinion of counsel that if Depositary undertakes such actions it will not be deemed an "issuer" under the Securities Act or an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges so permit, sell such rights, preferences or privileges of such holders at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Section 3.01 and Section 3.02, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.01 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of such rights, preferences or privileges, unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such rights, preferences or privileges have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
provided
however
 
     If registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement that it will promptly file a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such a registration statement shall have become effective or unless the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act and the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to such effect.
     If any other action under the law of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
     The Depositary will not be deemed to have any knowledge of any item for which it is supposed to receive notification under any Section of this Deposit Agreement unless and until it has received such notification.
     SECTION 4.04
Notice of Dividends; Fixing of Record Date for Holders of Receipts.
     Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable, any distribution other than cash shall be made, or any rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of (i) any meeting at which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to notice or (ii) any election on the part of the Company to redeem any shares of such Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting or to receive notice of such meeting or whose Depositary Shares are to be so redeemed.
     SECTION 4.05
Voting Rights.
     Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice, which shall be provided by the Company and which
 
shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting, (ii) a statement that the holders of Receipts at the close of business on a specified record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 will be entitled, subject to any applicable provision of law, to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares and (iii) a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of a holder of a Receipt on such record date, the Depositary shall insofar as practicable vote or cause to be voted the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request. To the extent any such instructions request the voting of a fractional interest of a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall aggregate such interest with all other fractional interests resulting from requests with the same voting instructions and shall vote the number of whole votes resulting from such aggregation in accordance with the instructions received in such requests. Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote and, accordingly, each Depositary Share is entitled to 1/1000 of a vote. The Company hereby agrees to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Convertible Preferred Stock or cause such Convertible Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will vote all Depositary Shares held by it in proportion with any instructions received. The Depositary shall not exercise any discretion in voting any Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.

     SECTION 4.06
Changes Affecting Convertible Preferred Stock and Reorganization Events.
     Upon any change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Convertible Preferred Stock, any Reorganization Event or any exchange of the Convertible Preferred Stock for cash, securities or other property, the Depositary shall, upon the written instructions of the Company setting forth any of the following adjustments, (i) reflect such adjustments in the Depositary's books and records in (a) the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Convertible Preferred Stock and (b) the ratio of the redemption price and the conversion rate per Depositary Share to the redemption price and the conversion rate, respectively, of a share of Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case as may be required by or as is consistent with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation to fully reflect the effects of such change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Convertible Preferred Stock, of such Reorganization Event or of such exchange and (ii) treat any shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) that shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock as new deposited property under this Deposit Agreement, and Receipts then outstanding shall thenceforth represent the proportionate interests of holders thereof in the new deposited property so received in exchange for or in respect of such Convertible Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may, upon the receipt of written request of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts, or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited property.
 
     SECTION 4.07
Inspection of Reports.
     The Depositary shall make available for inspection by holders of Receipts at the Depositary Office and at such other places as it may from time to time deem advisable during normal business hours any reports and communications received from the Company that are both received by the Depositary as the holder of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and made generally available to the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Depositary shall transmit, upon written request by the Company, certain notices and reports to the holders of Receipts as provided in Section 5.05.
     SECTION 4.08
Lists of Receipt Holders.
     Promptly upon request from time to time by the Company, the Registrar shall furnish to the Company a list, as of a recent date specified by the Company, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary Shares of all persons in whose names Receipts are registered on the books of the Registrar.
     SECTION 4.09
Withholding.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Deposit Agreement, in the event that the Depositary determines that any distribution in property is subject to any tax or other governmental charge which the Depositary is obligated by law to withhold, the Depositary may dispose of, by public or private sale, all or a portion of such property in such amounts and in such manner as the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay such taxes, and the Depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of any such sale or the balance of any such property after deduction of such taxes to the holders of Receipts entitled thereto in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares held by them, respectively; , , that in the event the Depositary determines that such distribution of property is subject to withholding tax only with respect to some but not all holders of Receipts, the Depositary will use its best efforts (i) to sell only that portion of such property distributable to such holders that is required to generate sufficient proceeds to pay such withholding tax and (ii) to effect any such sale in such a manner so as to avoid affecting the rights of any other holders of Receipts to receive such distribution in property.

     SECTION 5.01
Maintenance of Offices, Agencies and Transfer Books by the Depositary and the Registrar.
     The Depositary shall maintain at the Depositary Office facilities for the execution and delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange, split-up, combination and redemption of Receipts and deposit and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock and at the offices of the Depositary's Agents, if any, facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange, split-up, combination and redemption of Receipts and deposit and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock, all in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement.
 
     The Registrar shall keep books at the Depositary Office for the registration and transfer of Receipts, which books at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the record holders of Receipts as provided by applicable law. The Company may cause the Registrar to close such books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.
     If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or any other stock exchange, the Depositary may, with the written approval of the Company, appoint a registrar (acceptable to the Company) for registration of such Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with the requirements of such exchange. Such registrar (which may be the Registrar if so permitted by the requirements of such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar appointed by the Registrar upon the request or with the written approval of the Company. If the Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock are listed on one or more other stock exchanges, the Registrar will, at the request and expense of the Company, arrange such facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender, redemption and exchange of such Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock as may be required by law or applicable stock exchange regulations.
     SECTION 5.02
Prevention or Delay in Performance by the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar or the Company.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar, any Transfer Agent, or the Company shall incur any liability to any holder of any Receipt, if by reason of any provision of any present or future law or regulation thereunder of the United States of America or of any other governmental authority or, in the case of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or the Registrar or Transfer Agent, by reason of any provision, present or future, of the Certificate of Incorporation or, in the case of the Company, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar, by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party, the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Company shall be prevented or forbidden from doing or performing any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall be done or performed; nor shall the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, any Registrar or the Company incur any liability to any holder of a Receipt by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall or may be done or performed, or by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Deposit Agreement.

Obligations of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar and the Company.

Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or
 
Registrar assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to holders of Receipts, the Company or any other person or entity other than for its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Depositary, nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, lost profits, even if such person or entity alleged to be liable has knowledge of the possibility of such damages. Any liability of the Depositary and any Registrar or Transfer Agent under this Deposit Agreement will be limited to the amount of annual fees paid by the Company to the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares or Receipts that in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability, unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information provided by any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent and the Company may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
     In the event the Depositary shall receive conflicting claims, requests or instructions from any holders of Receipts, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, the Depositary shall be entitled to act on such claims, requests or instructions received from the Company, and shall incur no liability and shall be entitled to the full indemnification set forth in Section 5.06 in connection with any action so taken.
     The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action does not result from bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Depositary (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). The Depositary undertakes, and any Registrar or Transfer Agent shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.

hereunder. The Depositary may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Company and its affiliates or act in any other capacity for the Company or its affiliates.
     It is intended that neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent shall be deemed to be an "issuer" of the securities under the federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Depositary and any Depositary's Agent are acting only in a ministerial capacity as Depositary for the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock; , , that the Depositary agrees to comply with all information reporting and withholding requirements applicable to it under law or this Deposit Agreement in its capacity as Depositary.
provided
however

     Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively provided and established by a certificate signed by any one of the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasuer, Head of Corporate Finance, the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar; and such certificate shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar and the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent,
 
Transfer Agent or Registrar shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Deposit Agreement in reliance upon such certificate. The Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Deposit Agreement or in the Receipts (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.

          (i) shall have no duties or obligations other than those specifically set forth herein (and no implied duties or obligations), or as may subsequently be agreed to in writing by the parties;

          (iii) shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder; if, however, the Depositary determines to take any legal or other action hereunder, and, where the taking of such action might in the Depositary's judgment subject or expose it to any expense or liability, the Depositary shall not be required to act unless it shall have been furnished with an indemnity satisfactory to it;
          (iv) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon any certificate, instrument, opinion, notice, letter, facsimile transmission or other document or security delivered to the Depositary and believed by the Depositary to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper party or parties, and shall have no responsibility for determining the accuracy thereof;

Pending the preparation of definitive Receipts, the Depositary, upon, and pursuant to, the written order of the Company delivered in

If temporary Receipts are issued, the Company and the Depositary will cause definitive Receipts to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Receipts, the temporary Receipts shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts upon surrender of the temporary Receipts at the Depositary Office without charge to the holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Receipts, the Depositary is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver in exchange therefor definitive Receipts representing the same number of Depositary Shares as represented by the surrendered temporary Receipt or Receipts. Such exchange shall be made at the Company's expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Receipts shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Deposit Agreement, and with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited, as definitive Receipts.

No Receipt shall be entitled to any benefits under this Deposit Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless it shall have been executed as provided in the preceding sentence. The Depositary shall record on its books each Receipt executed as provided above and delivered as hereinafter provided. Receipts bearing the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Depositary who was at any time a proper signatory of the Depositary shall bind the Depositary, notwithstanding that such signatory ceased to hold such office prior to the execution and delivery of such Receipts by the Registrar or did not hold such office on the date of issuance of such Receipts.
provided
     Receipts shall be in denominations of any number of whole Depositary Shares. All Receipts shall be dated the date of their issuance.
     Receipts may be endorsed with or have incorporated in the text thereof such legends or recitals or changes not inconsistent with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement as may be required by the Depositary and approved by the Company, or which the Company has determined are required to comply with any applicable law or regulation or with the rules and regulations of any securities exchange upon which the Depositary Shares may be listed for trading or to conform with any usage with respect thereto, or to indicate any special limitations or restrictions to which any particular Receipts are subject, in each case as directed by the Company.
     Title to any Receipt (and to the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt) that is properly endorsed, or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer, or endorsement shall be transferable by delivery with the same effect as in the case of a negotiable instrument; , , that until transfer of a Receipt shall be registered on the books of the Depositary as provided in Section 2.04, the Depositary may, notwithstanding any notice to
provided
however
 
the contrary, treat the record holder thereof at such time as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of determining the person entitled to distributions of dividends or other distributions or payments with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock, to exercise any redemption, voting, or conversion rights or to receive any notice provided for in this Deposit Agreement and for all other purposes.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request by the Company, the Depositary and the Company will make application to DTC for acceptance of all or a portion of the Receipts for its book-entry settlement system. In connection with any such request, the Company hereby appoints the Depositary acting through any authorized officer thereof as its attorney-in-fact, with full power to delegate, for purposes of executing any agreements, certifications or other instruments or documents necessary or desirable in order to effect the acceptance of such Receipts for DTC eligibility. So long as the Receipts are eligible for book-entry settlement with DTC, unless otherwise required by law, all Depositary Shares to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange with book-entry settlement through DTC shall be represented by a single receipt (the "DTC Receipt"), which shall be deposited with DTC (or its custodian) evidencing all such Depositary Shares and registered in the name of the nominee of DTC (initially expected to be Cede & Co.). The Depositary or such other entity as is agreed to by DTC may hold the DTC Receipt as custodian for DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in the DTC Receipt shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected through, records maintained by (i) DTC or its nominee for such DTC Receipt, or (ii) institutions that have accounts with DTC.
     If issued, the DTC Receipt shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts only if (i) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue to make its book-entry settlement system available for the Receipts and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing, (ii) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under applicable law and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing or (iii) the Company executes and delivers to DTC a notice to the effect that such DTC Receipt shall be so exchangeable. If the beneficial owners of interests in Depositary Shares are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Receipts as the result of an event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such beneficial interests may be so exchanged, the Depositary is hereby directed to and shall provide written instructions to DTC to deliver to the Depositary for cancellation the DTC Receipt, and the Company shall instruct the Depositary in writing to execute and deliver to the beneficial owners of the Depositary Shares previously evidenced by the DTC Receipt definitive Receipts in physical form evidencing such Depositary Shares. The DTC Receipt shall be in such form and shall bear such legend or legends as may be appropriate or required by DTC in order for it to accept the Depositary Shares for its book-entry settlement system. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, if the Receipts are at any time eligible for book-entry settlement through DTC, delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and other property in connection with the withdrawal, redemption or conversion of Depositary Shares will be made through DTC and in accordance with its procedures, unless the holder of the relevant Receipt otherwise requests and such request is reasonably acceptable to the Depositary and the Company.

The Depositary acknowledges receipt of the aforementioned 300 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and related documentation and agrees to hold such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock in an account to be established by the Depositary at the Depositary Office or at such other office as the Depositary shall determine. The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder and The Bank of New York hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, will reflect changes in the number of shares (including any fractional shares) of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock held by it by notation, book-entry or other appropriate method.
     If required by the Depositary, Convertible Preferred Stock presented for deposit by the Company at any time, whether or not the register of stockholders of the Company is closed, shall also be accompanied by an agreement or assignment, or other instrument satisfactory to the Depositary, that will provide for the prompt transfer to the Depositary or its nominee of any dividend or right to subscribe for additional Convertible Preferred Stock or to receive other property that any person in whose name the Convertible Preferred Stock is or has been registered may thereafter receive upon or in respect of such deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or in lieu thereof such agreement of indemnity or other agreement as shall be satisfactory to the Depositary.
     Upon receipt by the Depositary of a certificate or certificates for Convertible Preferred Stock deposited hereunder, together with the other documents specified above, and upon registering such Convertible Preferred Stock in the name of the Depositary, the Depositary, subject to the terms and conditions of this Deposit Agreement, shall execute and deliver to, or upon the order of, the person or persons named in the written order delivered to the Depositary referred to in the first paragraph of this Section 2.02, a Receipt or Receipts for the number of whole Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock so deposited and registered in such name or names as may be requested by such person or persons. The Depositary shall execute and deliver such Receipt or Receipts at the Depositary Office, except that, at the request, risk and expense of any person requesting such delivery, such delivery may be made at such other place as may be designated by such person. Other than in the case of splits, combinations or other reclassifications affecting the Convertible Preferred Stock, or in the case of dividends or other distributions of Convertible Preferred Stock, if any, there shall be deposited hereunder not more than the number of shares constituting the Convertible Preferred Stock as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, as such may be amended. To the extent that the Company issues shares of Convertible Preferred Stock in excess of the amount set forth in the Certificate of Designation as of the date hereof
 
(which shares have been validly authorized by the Company), the Company shall notify the Depositary of such issuance in writing.
     The Company shall deliver to the Depositary from time to time such quantities of Receipts as the Depositary may request to enable the Depositary to perform its obligations under this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 2.03
Optional Redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock for Cash.
     Whenever the Company shall elect to redeem shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock for cash in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, it shall (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Depositary) give the Depositary not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior written notice of the date fixed for redemption of such Convertible Preferred Stock (the "redemption date") and of the number of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by the Depositary to be redeemed and the applicable redemption price (the "redemption price"), as set forth in the Certificate of Designation. The Depositary shall mail, first-class postage prepaid, notice of the redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock and the proposed simultaneous redemption of the Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to the holders of record on the record date fixed for such redemption pursuant to Section 4.04 of the Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed, at the addresses of such holders as the same appear on the records of the Depositary; but neither the failure to mail any such notice to one or more such holder nor any defect in any such notice shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for redemption except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given.
     The Company shall prepare and provide the Depositary with such notice, and each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be redeemed; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed; (v) the place or places where the Convertible Preferred Stock and the Receipts evidencing Depositary Shares to be redeemed are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (vi) that on the redemption date dividends in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue.
     In the event that notice of redemption has been made as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs and the Company shall then have paid in full to the Depositary the redemption price (determined pursuant to the Certificate of Designation) of the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary to be redeemed, the Depositary shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Convertible Preferred Stock so called for redemption by the Company and on the redemption date (unless the Company shall have failed to pay for the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed by it as set forth in the Company's notice provided for in the preceding paragraph), all dividends in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock called for redemption shall cease to accrue, the Depositary Shares called for redemption shall be deemed no longer to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (except the right to receive the redemption price) shall, to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate. Upon surrender in accordance
 
with said notice of the Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Depositary shall so require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed at a cash redemption price of $50 per Depositary Share plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the redemption date. The foregoing shall be further subject to the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Deposit Agreement and the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, the provisions of the Certificate of Designation will govern and the Company will instruct the Depositary in writing accordingly of such governing terms; , , that under no circumstances will the Certificate of Designation be deemed to change or modify any of the rights, duties or immunities of the Depositary contained herein.

however
     If fewer than all of the Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt are called for redemption, the Depositary will deliver to the holder of such Receipt upon its surrender to the Depositary, together with payment of the redemption price for and all other amounts payable in respect of the Depositary Shares called for redemption, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares evidenced by such prior Receipt and not called for redemption.
     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemed pursuant to the Company's exercise of its optional redemption right, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be redeemed pursuant to this Section 2.03 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable.
     SECTION 2.04
Registration of Transfers of Receipts.
     The Company hereby appoints The Bank of New York as the Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Receipts and The Bank of New York hereby accepts such appointment and, as such, shall register on its books from time to time transfers of Receipts upon any surrender thereof by the holder in person or by a duly authorized attorney, agent or representative properly endorsed or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer or endorsement, together with evidence of the payment by the applicable party of any transfer taxes as may be required by law.

Shares by surrendering such Receipt or Receipts to the Depositary or at such other office as the Depositary may designate for such withdrawals; , that a holder of a Receipt or Receipts may not withdraw such Convertible Preferred Stock (or money and other property, if any, represented thereby) which has previously been called for redemption.

If the Receipt or Receipts delivered by the holder to the Depositary in connection with such withdrawal shall evidence a number of Depositary Shares in excess of the number of Depositary Shares representing the number of whole shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock to be withdrawn, the Depositary shall at the same time, in addition to such number of whole shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and such money and other property, if any, to be withdrawn, deliver to such holder, or (subject to Section 2.04) upon his order, a new Receipt or Receipts evidencing such excess number of Depositary Shares.

Depositary shares may be converted at the option of the holders only in lots of 1,000 Depositary Shares or integral multiples thereof.
     On the date of any conversion at the option of the holders, a holder of a Receipt shall surrender such Receipt at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly
 
completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipt to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent, thereby instructing the Depositary to cause the conversion of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt specified in such notice of conversion into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation.

computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
     In the event that optional conversion is elected by a holder of a surrendered Receipt with respect to less than all Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.10 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.

     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.11 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     SECTION 2.12

Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt in connection with a conversion at the option of the Company, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.

     SECTION 2.13
Fractional Shares.
     No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued to a holder of the Depositary Shares upon conversion. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable, the holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock, calculated on an aggregate basis in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted, multiplied by the Closing Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) of the Common Stock on the trading day (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) immediately preceding the applicable conversion date, which shall be paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether the amounts of funds paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion are correct.

The Depositary or the Company may withhold or delay the delivery of any Receipt, the transfer, redemption or exchange of any Receipt, the withdrawal of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by any Receipt, the distribution of any dividend or other distribution or the sale of any rights or of the proceeds thereof, until such proof or other information is filed, or such certificates are executed.

Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares.

     The Company will pay any and all stock transfer, documentary, stamp and similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of Depositary Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Depositary Shares or certificates representing such shares or securities. The Company will not, however, be required to pay any such tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, shares of Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in which the Depositary Shares with respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment to any person other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and will not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
     SECTION 4.01
Cash Distributions.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, including any cash received upon redemption of any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.03, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of such sum as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders; , , that in case the Company or the Depositary shall be required by law to and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Receipts held by any holder an amount on account of taxes or as otherwise required by law, regulation or court process, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares represented by such Receipts subject to such withholding shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary, however, shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Receipts a fraction of one cent. Any such fractional amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent and so distributed to registered holders entitled thereto and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for
provided
however
 
interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next succeeding distribution to record holders of such Receipts. Each holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with a properly completed Form W-8 (i.e., Form W-8BEN, Form W-8EXP, Form W-8IMY, Form W8ECI or another applicable Form W-8) or Form W-9 (which form shall set forth such holder's certified taxpayer identification number if requested on such form), as may be applicable. Each holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distribution to be made hereunder.
     SECTION 4.02
Distributions Other Than Cash.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Depositary and the Company may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of securities to the holders of Receipts unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such securities have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
     SECTION 4.03
Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
     If the Company shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names deposited Convertible Preferred Stock is registered on the books of the Company any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts in such manner as the Company shall instruct (including by the issue to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges); , , that (a) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Company determines upon advice of its legal counsel that it is not lawful or feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to the holders of Receipts (by the issue of warrants or otherwise) or (b) if and to the extent instructed by holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, the Depositary shall then, if so directed by the Company and provided with an opinion of counsel that if Depositary undertakes such actions it will not be deemed an "issuer" under the Securities Act or an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges so permit, sell such rights, preferences or privileges of such holders at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Section 3.01 and Section 3.02, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.01 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of such rights, preferences or privileges, unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such rights, preferences or privileges have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
provided
however
 
          If registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement that it will promptly file a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such a registration statement shall have become effective or unless the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act and the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to such effect.
          If any other action under the law of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
          The Depositary will not be deemed to have any knowledge of any item for which it is supposed to receive notification under any Section of this Deposit Agreement unless and until it has received such notification.
          SECTION 4.04
Notice of Dividends; Fixing of Record Date for Holders of Receipts.
          Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable, any distribution other than cash shall be made, or any rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of (i) any meeting at which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to notice or (ii) any election on the part of the Company to redeem any shares of such Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting or to receive notice of such meeting or whose Depositary Shares are to be so redeemed.
          SECTION 4.05
Voting Rights.
          Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice, which shall be provided by the Company and which
 
shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting, (ii) a statement that the holders of Receipts at the close of business on a specified record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 will be entitled, subject to any applicable provision of law, to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares and (iii) a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of a holder of a Receipt on such record date, the Depositary shall insofar as practicable vote or cause to be voted the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request. To the extent any such instructions request the voting of a fractional interest of a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall aggregate such interest with all other fractional interests resulting from requests with the same voting instructions and shall vote the number of whole votes resulting from such aggregation in accordance with the instructions received in such requests. Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote and, accordingly, each Depositary Share is entitled to 1/1000 of a vote. The Company hereby agrees to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Convertible Preferred Stock or cause such Convertible Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will vote all Depositary Shares held by it in proportion with any instructions received. The Depositary shall not exercise any discretion in voting any Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.
th
          SECTION 4.06
Changes Affecting Convertible Preferred Stock and Reorganization Events.
          Upon any change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Convertible Preferred Stock, any Reorganization Event or any exchange of the Convertible Preferred Stock for cash, securities or other property, the Depositary shall, upon the written instructions of the Company setting forth any of the following adjustments, (i) reflect such adjustments in the Depositary's books and records in (a) the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Convertible Preferred Stock and (b) the ratio of the redemption price and the conversion rate per Depositary Share to the redemption price and the conversion rate, respectively, of a share of Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case as may be required by or as is consistent with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation to fully reflect the effects of such change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Convertible Preferred Stock, of such Reorganization Event or of such exchange and (ii) treat any shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) that shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock as new deposited property under this Deposit Agreement, and Receipts then outstanding shall thenceforth represent the proportionate interests of holders thereof in the new deposited property so received in exchange for or in respect of such Convertible Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may, upon the receipt of written request of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts, or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited property.
 
          SECTION 4.07
Inspection of Reports.
          The Depositary shall make available for inspection by holders of Receipts at the Depositary Office and at such other places as it may from time to time deem advisable during normal business hours any reports and communications received from the Company that are both received by the Depositary as the holder of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and made generally available to the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Depositary shall transmit, upon written request by the Company, certain notices and reports to the holders of Receipts as provided in Section 5.05.
          SECTION 4.08
Lists of Receipt Holders.
          Promptly upon request from time to time by the Company, the Registrar shall furnish to the Company a list, as of a recent date specified by the Company, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary Shares of all persons in whose names Receipts are registered on the books of the Registrar.
          SECTION 4.09
Withholding.
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Deposit Agreement, in the event that the Depositary determines that any distribution in property is subject to any tax or other governmental charge which the Depositary is obligated by law to withhold, the Depositary may dispose of, by public or private sale, all or a portion of such property in such amounts and in such manner as the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay such taxes, and the Depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of any such sale or the balance of any such property after deduction of such taxes to the holders of Receipts entitled thereto in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares held by them, respectively; , , that in the event the Depositary determines that such distribution of property is subject to withholding tax only with respect to some but not all holders of Receipts, the Depositary will use its best efforts (i) to sell only that portion of such property distributable to such holders that is required to generate sufficient proceeds to pay such withholding tax and (ii) to effect any such sale in such a manner so as to avoid affecting the rights of any other holders of Receipts to receive such distribution in property.

however
          SECTION 5.01
Maintenance of Offices, Agencies and Transfer Books by the Depositary and the Registrar.
          The Depositary shall maintain at the Depositary Office facilities for the execution and delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange, split-up, combination and redemption of Receipts and deposit and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock and at the offices of the Depositary's Agents, if any, facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange, split-up, combination and redemption of Receipts and deposit and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock, all in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement.
 
          The Registrar shall keep books at the Depositary Office for the registration and transfer of Receipts, which books at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the record holders of Receipts as provided by applicable law. The Company may cause the Registrar to close such books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.
          If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or any other stock exchange, the Depositary may, with the written approval of the Company, appoint a registrar (acceptable to the Company) for registration of such Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with the requirements of such exchange. Such registrar (which may be the Registrar if so permitted by the requirements of such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar appointed by the Registrar upon the request or with the written approval of the Company. If the Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock are listed on one or more other stock exchanges, the Registrar will, at the request and expense of the Company, arrange such facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender, redemption and exchange of such Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock as may be required by law or applicable stock exchange regulations.
          SECTION 5.02
Prevention or Delay in Performance by the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar or the Company.
          None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar, any Transfer Agent, or the Company shall incur any liability to any holder of any Receipt, if by reason of any provision of any present or future law or regulation thereunder of the United States of America or of any other governmental authority or, in the case of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or the Registrar or Transfer Agent, by reason of any provision, present or future, of the Certificate of Incorporation or, in the case of the Company, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar, by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party, the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Company shall be prevented or forbidden from doing or performing any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall be done or performed; nor shall the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, any Registrar or the Company incur any liability to any holder of a Receipt by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall or may be done or performed, or by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Deposit Agreement.
          SECTION 5.03
Obligations of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar and the Company.
          The Company does not assume any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement or any Receipt to holders of Receipts other than from acts or omissions arising out of conduct constituting bad faith, negligence (in the case of any action or inaction with respect to the voting of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock), gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement. Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or
 
Registrar assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to holders of Receipts, the Company or any other person or entity other than for its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Depositary, nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, lost profits, even if such person or entity alleged to be liable has knowledge of the possibility of such damages. Any liability of the Depositary and any Registrar or Transfer Agent under this Deposit Agreement will be limited to the amount of annual fees paid by the Company to the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
          None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares or Receipts that in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability, unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
          None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information provided by any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent and the Company may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
          In the event the Depositary shall receive conflicting claims, requests or instructions from any holders of Receipts, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, the Depositary shall be entitled to act on such claims, requests or instructions received from the Company, and shall incur no liability and shall be entitled to the full indemnification set forth in Section 5.06 in connection with any action so taken.
          The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action does not result from bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Depositary (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). The Depositary undertakes, and any Registrar or Transfer Agent shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.

hereunder. The Depositary may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Company and its affiliates or act in any other capacity for the Company or its affiliates.
          It is intended that neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent shall be deemed to be an "issuer" of the securities under the federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Depositary and any Depositary's Agent are acting only in a ministerial capacity as Depositary for the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock; , , that the Depositary agrees to comply with all information reporting and withholding requirements applicable to it under law or this Deposit Agreement in its capacity as Depositary.
provided
however
          Neither the Depositary (or its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates) nor any Depositary's Agent makes any representation or has any responsibility as to the validity of the registration statement pursuant to which the Depositary Shares are registered under the Securities Act, the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares, the Receipts (except its countersignature thereon) or any instruments referred to therein or herein, or as to the correctness of any statement made therein or herein; , , that the Depositary is responsible for its representations in this Deposit Agreement.
provided
however

          In the event the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or any Registrar or Transfer Agent believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists in any notice, instruction, direction, request or other communication, paper or document received by it pursuant to this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall promptly notify the Company of the details of such alleged ambiguity or uncertainty, and may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any action, and the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be fully protected and shall incur no liability to any person from refraining from taking such action, absent bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction), unless and until (i) the rights of all parties have been fully and finally adjudicated by a court of appropriate jurisdiction or (ii) the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar receives written instructions with respect to such matter signed by the Company that eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar.
          Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively provided and established by a certificate signed by any one of the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasuer, Head of Corporate Finance, the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar; and such certificate shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar and the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent,
 
Transfer Agent or Registrar shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Deposit Agreement in reliance upon such certificate. The Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Deposit Agreement or in the Receipts (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
          The Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar will not be under any duty or responsibility to ensure compliance with any applicable federal or state securities laws in connection with the issuance, transfer or exchange of the Receipts, Stock or Depositary Shares.
          Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment to the Certificate of Designation shall affect the rights, duties, obligations or immunities of the Depositary, Transfer Agent, the Depositary's Agent or Registrar hereunder.
          The Depositary, Transfer Agent and any Registrar hereunder:
               (i) shall have no duties or obligations other than those specifically set forth herein (and no implied duties or obligations), or as may subsequently be agreed to in writing by the parties;
               (ii) shall have no obligation to make payment hereunder unless the Company shall have provided the necessary federal or other immediately available funds or securities or property, as the case may be, to pay in full amounts due and payable with respect thereto;
               (iii) shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder; if, however, the Depositary determines to take any legal or other action hereunder, and, where the taking of such action might in the Depositary's judgment subject or expose it to any expense or liability, the Depositary shall not be required to act unless it shall have been furnished with an indemnity satisfactory to it;
               (iv) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon any certificate, instrument, opinion, notice, letter, facsimile transmission or other document or security delivered to the Depositary and believed by the Depositary to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper party or parties, and shall have no responsibility for determining the accuracy thereof;
               (v) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon the written, telephonic, electronic and oral instructions, with respect to any matter relating to the Depositary's actions as depositary covered by this Deposit Agreement (or supplementing or qualifying any such actions) of officers of the Company;
               (vi) may consult counsel satisfactory to it, and the advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by the Depositary hereunder in accordance with the advice of such counsel;
 
               (vii) shall not be called upon at any time to advise any person with respect to the Depositary Shares or Receipts;
               (viii) shall not be liable or responsible for any recital or statement contained in any documents relating hereto or the Depositary Shares or Receipts; and
               (ix) shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties (other than with respect to the Depositary) executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Deposit Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for under this Deposit Agreement.
          The obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.03 shall survive the replacement, removal or resignation of any Depositary, Registrar, Transfer Agent or Depositary's Agent or termination of this Deposit Agreement.
          SECTION 5.04
Resignation and Removal of the Depositary; Appointment of Successor Depositary.
          The Depositary may at any time resign as Depositary hereunder by notice of its election to do so delivered to the Company, such resignation to take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided.
          The Depositary may at any time be removed by the Company by notice of such removal delivered to the Depositary, such removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided. Upon any such removal or appointment, the Company shall send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of Receipts.
          In case at any time the Depositary acting hereunder shall resign or be removed, the Company shall, within 60 days after the delivery of the notice of resignation or removal, as the case may be, appoint a successor depositary, which shall be an entity having its principal office in the United States of America and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If a successor depositary shall not have been appointed and have accepted appointment in 60 days, the resigning Depositary may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor depositary. Every successor depositary shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Company an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor depositary, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Company, shall promptly execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all rights, title and interest in the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and any moneys or property held hereunder to such successor and shall deliver to such successor a list of the record holders of all outstanding Receipts.
          Any corporation or other entity into or with which the Depositary may be merged, consolidated or converted, or any corporation or other entity to which all or a substantial part of the assets of the Depositary may be transferred, shall be the successor of such Depositary without the
 
execution or filing of any document or any further act. Such successor depositary may execute the Receipts either in the name of the predecessor depositary or in the name of the successor depositary.

Pending the preparation of definitive Receipts, the Depositary, upon, and pursuant to, the written order of the Company delivered in
 
compliance with Section 2.02 shall be authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver temporary Receipts which shall be substantially of the tenor of the definitive Receipts in lieu of which they are issued and in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the persons executing such Receipts may determine (but which do not affect the rights or duties of the Depositary), as evidenced by their execution of such Receipts. If temporary Receipts are issued, the Company and the Depositary will cause definitive Receipts to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Receipts, the temporary Receipts shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts upon surrender of the temporary Receipts at the Depositary Office without charge to the holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Receipts, the Depositary is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, execute and deliver in exchange therefor definitive Receipts representing the same number of Depositary Shares as represented by the surrendered temporary Receipt or Receipts. Such exchange shall be made at the Company's expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Receipts shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Deposit Agreement, and with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited, as definitive Receipts.

No Receipt shall be entitled to any benefits under this Deposit Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless it shall have been executed as provided in the preceding sentence. The Depositary shall record on its books each Receipt executed as provided above and delivered as hereinafter provided. Receipts bearing the manual or facsimile signature of a duly authorized signatory of the Depositary who was at any time a proper signatory of the Depositary shall bind the Depositary, notwithstanding that such signatory ceased to hold such office prior to the execution and delivery of such Receipts by the Registrar or did not hold such office on the date of issuance of such Receipts.
provided
     Receipts shall be in denominations of any number of whole Depositary Shares. All Receipts shall be dated the date of their issuance.

     Title to any Receipt (and to the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt) that is properly endorsed, or accompanied by a properly executed instrument of transfer, or endorsement shall be transferable by delivery with the same effect as in the case of a negotiable instrument; , , that until transfer of a Receipt shall be registered on the books of the Depositary as provided in Section 2.04, the Depositary may, notwithstanding any notice to

the contrary, treat the record holder thereof at such time as the absolute owner thereof for the purpose of determining the person entitled to distributions of dividends or other distributions or payments with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock, to exercise any redemption, voting, or conversion rights or to receive any notice provided for in this Deposit Agreement and for all other purposes.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon request by the Company, the Depositary and the Company will make application to DTC for acceptance of all or a portion of the Receipts for its book-entry settlement system. In connection with any such request, the Company hereby appoints the Depositary acting through any authorized officer thereof as its attorney-in-fact, with full power to delegate, for purposes of executing any agreements, certifications or other instruments or documents necessary or desirable in order to effect the acceptance of such Receipts for DTC eligibility. So long as the Receipts are eligible for book-entry settlement with DTC, unless otherwise required by law, all Depositary Shares to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange with book-entry settlement through DTC shall be represented by a single receipt (the "DTC Receipt"), which shall be deposited with DTC (or its custodian) evidencing all such Depositary Shares and registered in the name of the nominee of DTC (initially expected to be Cede & Co.). The Depositary or such other entity as is agreed to by DTC may hold the DTC Receipt as custodian for DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in the DTC Receipt shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected through, records maintained by (i) DTC or its nominee for such DTC Receipt, or (ii) institutions that have accounts with DTC.
     If issued, the DTC Receipt shall be exchangeable for definitive Receipts only if (i) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue to make its book-entry settlement system available for the Receipts and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing, (ii) DTC notifies the Company at any time that it has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under applicable law and a successor to DTC is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of the date the Company is so informed in writing or (iii) the Company executes and delivers to DTC a notice to the effect that such DTC Receipt shall be so exchangeable. If the beneficial owners of interests in Depositary Shares are entitled to exchange such interests for definitive Receipts as the result of an event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the preceding sentence, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which such beneficial interests may be so exchanged, the Depositary is hereby directed to and shall provide written instructions to DTC to deliver to the Depositary for cancellation the DTC Receipt, and the Company shall instruct the Depositary in writing to execute and deliver to the beneficial owners of the Depositary Shares previously evidenced by the DTC Receipt definitive Receipts in physical form evidencing such Depositary Shares. The DTC Receipt shall be in such form and shall bear such legend or legends as may be appropriate or required by DTC in order for it to accept the Depositary Shares for its book-entry settlement system. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, if the Receipts are at any time eligible for book-entry settlement through DTC, delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and other property in connection with the withdrawal, redemption or conversion of Depositary Shares will be made through DTC and in accordance with its procedures, unless the holder of the relevant Receipt otherwise requests and such request is reasonably acceptable to the Depositary and the Company.

     The Company shall deliver to the Depositary from time to time such quantities of Receipts as the Depositary may request to enable the Depositary to perform its obligations under this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 2.03
Optional Redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock for Cash.
     Whenever the Company shall elect to redeem shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock for cash in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, it shall (unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Depositary) give the Depositary not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior written notice of the date fixed for redemption of such Convertible Preferred Stock (the "redemption date") and of the number of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by the Depositary to be redeemed and the applicable redemption price (the "redemption price"), as set forth in the Certificate of Designation. The Depositary shall mail, first-class postage prepaid, notice of the redemption of Convertible Preferred Stock and the proposed simultaneous redemption of the Depositary Shares representing the Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed, not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to the holders of record on the record date fixed for such redemption pursuant to Section 4.04 of the Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares to be so redeemed, at the addresses of such holders as the same appear on the records of the Depositary; but neither the failure to mail any such notice to one or more such holder nor any defect in any such notice shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for redemption except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given.
     The Company shall prepare and provide the Depositary with such notice, and each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be redeemed; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed; (v) the place or places where the Convertible Preferred Stock and the Receipts evidencing Depositary Shares to be redeemed are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (vi) that on the redemption date dividends in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue.
     In the event that notice of redemption has been made as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs and the Company shall then have paid in full to the Depositary the redemption price (determined pursuant to the Certificate of Designation) of the Convertible Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary to be redeemed, the Depositary shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Convertible Preferred Stock so called for redemption by the Company and on the redemption date (unless the Company shall have failed to pay for the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to be redeemed by it as set forth in the Company's notice provided for in the preceding paragraph), all dividends in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock called for redemption shall cease to accrue, the Depositary Shares called for redemption shall be deemed no longer to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (except the right to receive the redemption price) shall, to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate. Upon surrender in accordance
 
with said notice of the Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Depositary shall so require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed at a cash redemption price of $50 per Depositary Share plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the redemption date. The foregoing shall be further subject to the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Deposit Agreement and the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, the provisions of the Certificate of Designation will govern and the Company will instruct the Depositary in writing accordingly of such governing terms; , , that under no circumstances will the Certificate of Designation be deemed to change or modify any of the rights, duties or immunities of the Depositary contained herein.

however
     If fewer than all of the Depositary Shares evidenced by a Receipt are called for redemption, the Depositary will deliver to the holder of such Receipt upon its surrender to the Depositary, together with payment of the redemption price for and all other amounts payable in respect of the Depositary Shares called for redemption, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares evidenced by such prior Receipt and not called for redemption.
     If less than all of the Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemed pursuant to the Company's exercise of its optional redemption right, the Depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be redeemed pursuant to this Section 2.03 on a pro rata basis, by lot or in such other manner as the Depositary may determine to be fair and equitable.

Shares by surrendering such Receipt or Receipts to the Depositary or at such other office as the Depositary may designate for such withdrawals; , that a holder of a Receipt or Receipts may not withdraw such Convertible Preferred Stock (or money and other property, if any, represented thereby) which has previously been called for redemption.

If the Receipt or Receipts delivered by the holder to the Depositary in connection with such withdrawal shall evidence a number of Depositary Shares in excess of the number of Depositary Shares representing the number of whole shares of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock to be withdrawn, the Depositary shall at the same time, in addition to such number of whole shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and such money and other property, if any, to be withdrawn, deliver to such holder, or (subject to Section 2.04) upon his order, a new Receipt or Receipts evidencing such excess number of Depositary Shares.

Depositary shares may be converted at the option of the holders only in lots of 1,000 Depositary Shares or integral multiples thereof.
     On the date of any conversion at the option of the holders, a holder of a Receipt shall surrender such Receipt at the Depositary Office or such other office as the Depositary may from time to time designate for such purpose, together with a notice of conversion thereof duly
 
completed and executed and a proper assignment of such Receipt to the Company or the Transfer Agent or in blank to the Depositary or its agent, thereby instructing the Depositary to cause the conversion of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt specified in such notice of conversion into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation. If required, the holder must also pay any stock transfer, documentary, stamp or similar taxes not payable by the Company pursuant to the Certificate of Designation or Section 3.05. Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt, together with a notice of conversion supplied by the holder of such Receipt and instructing the Conversion Agent to convert a specified number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.
     As promptly as practicable after such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent of the Company has received such certificates from the Conversion Agent, (a) the Company shall cause to be furnished to the Depositary a certificate or certificates evidencing such number of shares of Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.

computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation, to the extent required thereunder. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether Receipts representing shares of Convertible Preferred Stock are surrendered for conversion between the close of business on the Dividend Record Date and the opening of business on the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date, and whether the amount of funds, if any, submitted by the holder of the Receipts is equal to the dividend payable on the underlying Convertible Preferred Stock on such Dividend Payment Date or whether such was computed and paid as set forth in the Certificate of Designation.
     In the event that optional conversion is elected by a holder of a surrendered Receipt with respect to less than all Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt, upon such optional conversion the Depositary shall authenticate, countersign and deliver to such holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Receipt evidencing the Depositary Shares as to which such optional conversion was not effected.
     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.10 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.

Common Stock, and such amount of immediately available funds, if any, in lieu of receiving fractional shares as specified in a written notice from the Company and (b) the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, deliver at the Depositary Office, (i) a certificate or certificates evidencing the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by the such Receipt has been converted and which have been provided by the Company (or cash in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 10(c) of the Certificate of Designation) and (ii) cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.13 and which has been provided by the Company.

     Delivery of Common Stock and other property following a conversion pursuant to this Section 2.11 may be made by the delivery of certificates and which, if required by law in the judgment of the Company, shall be accompanied by proper instruments of transfer. If such delivery is to be made otherwise than at the Depositary Office, such delivery shall be made, as hereinafter provided, without unreasonable delay, at the risk of any holder surrendering Receipts, and for the account of such holder, to such place designated in writing by such holder.
     SECTION 2.12

Conversion of the Receipts will be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the date on which the foregoing requirements shall have been satisfied.
     Upon receipt by the Conversion Agent of a Receipt in connection with a conversion at the option of the Company, the Conversion Agent is hereby authorized and instructed to, and shall, as promptly as practicable, (a) give written notice to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock of the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt surrendered for conversion and the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and the amount of immediately available funds (as specified in writing by the Company), if any, to be delivered to the holder of such Receipts in payment of any fractional shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, (b) cancel such Receipt or, if a Registrar for Receipts (other than the Conversion Agent) shall have been appointed, cause such Registrar to cancel such Receipt, and (c) deliver to the Transfer Agent for the Convertible Preferred Stock or any other authorized agent of the Company (as specified in writing by the Company) certificates for the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as evidenced by such Receipt, which certificates shall thereupon be canceled by such Transfer Agent or other authorized agent.

If the Conversion Agent selects a portion of a holder's Depositary Shares for partial conversion at the option of the Company and the holder converts a portion of the same share of Depositary Shares, the converted portion will be deemed to be from the portion selected for conversion.
     SECTION 2.13
Fractional Shares.
     No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued to a holder of the Depositary Shares upon conversion. In lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable, the holder will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the fraction of a share of Common Stock, calculated on an aggregate basis in respect of the shares of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted, multiplied by the Closing Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) of the Common Stock on the trading day (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) immediately preceding the applicable conversion date, which shall be paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion. The Depositary shall have no duty or obligation to investigate or inquire whether the amounts of funds paid by the Company to the Depositary for the benefit of the holder in connection with any such conversion are correct.

     The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Receipts, when issued, will evidence legal and valid interests in the Depositary Shares and each Depositary Share will represent a legal and valid 1/1,000 fractional interest in a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Share. Such representation and warranty shall survive the deposit of the Convertible Preferred Stock and the issuance of Receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares.
th
     SECTION 3.05
Taxes.
     The Company will pay any and all stock transfer, documentary, stamp and similar taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of Depositary Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Depositary Shares or certificates representing such shares or securities. The Company will not, however, be required to pay any such tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares, shares of Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in which the Depositary Shares with respect to which such shares or other securities are issued or delivered were registered, or in respect of any payment to any person other than a payment to the registered holder thereof, and will not be required to make any such issuance, delivery or payment unless and until the person otherwise entitled to such issuance, delivery or payment has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Company, that such tax has been paid or is not payable.
     SECTION 4.01
Cash Distributions.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any cash dividend or other cash distribution on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, including any cash received upon redemption of any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.03, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of such sum as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders; , , that in case the Company or the Depositary shall be required by law to and shall withhold from any cash dividend or other cash distribution in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Receipts held by any holder an amount on account of taxes or as otherwise required by law, regulation or court process, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares represented by such Receipts subject to such withholding shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary, however, shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Receipts a fraction of one cent. Any such fractional amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent and so distributed to registered holders entitled thereto and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for
provided
however
 
interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next succeeding distribution to record holders of such Receipts. Each holder of a Receipt shall provide the Depositary with a properly completed Form W-8 (i.e., Form W-8BEN, Form W-8EXP, Form W-8IMY, Form W8ECI or another applicable Form W-8) or Form W-9 (which form shall set forth such holder's certified taxpayer identification number if requested on such form), as may be applicable. Each holder of a Receipt acknowledges that, in the event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended, may require withholding by the Depositary of a portion of any of the distribution to be made hereunder.
     SECTION 4.02
Distributions Other Than Cash.
     Whenever the Depositary shall receive any distribution other than cash on the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall, subject to Section 3.02, distribute to record holders of Receipts on the record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 such amounts of the securities or property received by it as are, as nearly as practicable, in proportion to the respective numbers of Depositary Shares evidenced by the Receipts held by such holders, in any manner that the Depositary and the Company may deem equitable and practicable for accomplishing such distribution. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of securities to the holders of Receipts unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such securities have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
     SECTION 4.03
Subscription Rights, Preferences or Privileges.
     If the Company shall at any time offer or cause to be offered to the persons in whose names deposited Convertible Preferred Stock is registered on the books of the Company any rights, preferences or privileges to subscribe for or to purchase any securities or any rights, preferences or privileges of any other nature, such rights, preferences or privileges shall in each such instance be made available by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts in such manner as the Company shall instruct (including by the issue to such record holders of warrants representing such rights, preferences or privileges); , , that (a) if at the time of issue or offer of any such rights, preferences or privileges the Company determines upon advice of its legal counsel that it is not lawful or feasible to make such rights, preferences or privileges available to the holders of Receipts (by the issue of warrants or otherwise) or (b) if and to the extent instructed by holders of Receipts who do not desire to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges, the Depositary shall then, if so directed by the Company and provided with an opinion of counsel that if Depositary undertakes such actions it will not be deemed an "issuer" under the Securities Act or an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and if applicable laws or the terms of such rights, preferences or privileges so permit, sell such rights, preferences or privileges of such holders at public or private sale, at such place or places and upon such terms as it may deem proper. The net proceeds of any such sale shall, subject to Section 3.01 and Section 3.02, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.01 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of such rights, preferences or privileges, unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such rights, preferences or privileges have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
provided
however
 
     If registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement, that it will promptly file a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such a registration statement shall have become effective or unless the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act and the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to such effect.
     If any other action under the law of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
     The Depositary will not be deemed to have any knowledge of any item for which it is supposed to receive notification under any Section of this Deposit Agreement unless and until it has received such notification.
     SECTION 4.04
Notice of Dividends; Fixing of Record Date for Holders of Receipts.
     Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable, any distribution other than cash shall be made, or any rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of (i) any meeting at which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to notice or (ii) any election on the part of the Company to redeem any shares of such Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting or to receive notice of such meeting or whose Depositary Shares are to be so redeemed.
     SECTION 4.05
Voting Rights.
     Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice, which shall be provided by the Company and which
 
shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting, (ii) a statement that the holders of Receipts at the close of business on a specified record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 will be entitled, subject to any applicable provision of law, to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares and (iii) a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of a holder of a Receipt on such record date, the Depositary shall insofar as practicable vote or cause to be voted the amount of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request. To the extent any such instructions request the voting of a fractional interest of a share of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall aggregate such interest with all other fractional interests resulting from requests with the same voting instructions and shall vote the number of whole votes resulting from such aggregation in accordance with the instructions received in such requests. Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote and, accordingly, each Depositary Share is entitled to 1/1000 of a vote. The Company hereby agrees to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Convertible Preferred Stock or cause such Convertible Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will vote all Depositary Shares held by it in proportion with any instructions received. The Depositary shall not exercise any discretion in voting any Convertible Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.
th
     SECTION 4.06
Changes Affecting Convertible Preferred Stock and Reorganization Events.
     Upon any change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Convertible Preferred Stock, any Reorganization Event or any exchange of the Convertible Preferred Stock for cash, securities or other property, the Depositary shall, upon the written instructions of the Company setting forth any of the following adjustments, (i) reflect such adjustments in the Depositary's books and records in (a) the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Convertible Preferred Stock and (b) the ratio of the redemption price and the conversion rate per Depositary Share to the redemption price and the conversion rate, respectively, of a share of Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case as may be required by or as is consistent with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation to fully reflect the effects of such change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Convertible Preferred Stock, of such Reorganization Event or of such exchange and (ii) treat any shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) that shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or in respect of the Convertible Preferred Stock as new deposited property under this Deposit Agreement, and Receipts then outstanding shall thenceforth represent the proportionate interests of holders thereof in the new deposited property so received in exchange for or in respect of such Convertible Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may, upon the receipt of written request of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts, or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited property.
     SECTION 4.07
Inspection of Reports.
 
     The Depositary shall make available for inspection by holders of Receipts at the Depositary Office and at such other places as it may from time to time deem advisable during normal business hours any reports and communications received from the Company that are both received by the Depositary as the holder of deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and made generally available to the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, the Depositary shall transmit, upon written request by the Company, certain notices and reports to the holders of Receipts as provided in Section 5.05.
     SECTION 4.08
Lists of Receipt Holders.
     Promptly upon request from time to time by the Company, the Registrar shall furnish to the Company a list, as of a recent date specified by the Company, of the names, addresses and holdings of Depositary Shares of all persons in whose names Receipts are registered on the books of the Registrar.
     SECTION 4.09
Withholding.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Deposit Agreement, in the event that the Depositary determines that any distribution in property is subject to any tax or other governmental charge which the Depositary is obligated by law to withhold, the Depositary may dispose of, by public or private sale, all or a portion of such property in such amounts and in such manner as the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay such taxes, and the Depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of any such sale or the balance of any such property after deduction of such taxes to the holders of Receipts entitled thereto in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares held by them, respectively; , , that in the event the Depositary determines that such distribution of property is subject to withholding tax only with respect to some but not all holders of Receipts, the Depositary will use its best efforts (i) to sell only that portion of such property distributable to such holders that is required to generate sufficient proceeds to pay such withholding tax and (ii) to effect any such sale in such a manner so as to avoid affecting the rights of any other holders of Receipts to receive such distribution in property.

     SECTION 5.01
Maintenance of Offices, Agencies and Transfer Books by the Depositary and the Registrar.
     The Depositary shall maintain at the Depositary Office facilities for the execution and delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange, split-up, combination and redemption of Receipts and deposit and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock and at the offices of the Depositary's Agents, if any, facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender and exchange, split-up, combination and redemption of Receipts and deposit and withdrawal of Convertible Preferred Stock, all in accordance with the provisions of this Deposit Agreement.
     The Registrar shall keep books at the Depositary Office for the registration and transfer of Receipts, which books at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the record holders of Receipts as provided by applicable law. The Company may cause the Registrar to close such
 
books, at any time or from time to time, when deemed expedient by it in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder.
     If the Receipts or the Depositary Shares evidenced thereby or the Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or any other stock exchange, the Depositary may, with the written approval of the Company, appoint a registrar (acceptable to the Company) for registration of such Receipts or Depositary Shares in accordance with the requirements of such exchange. Such registrar (which may be the Registrar if so permitted by the requirements of such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar appointed by the Registrar upon the request or with the written approval of the Company. If the Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock are listed on one or more other stock exchanges, the Registrar will, at the request and expense of the Company, arrange such facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender, redemption and exchange of such Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Convertible Preferred Stock as may be required by law or applicable stock exchange regulations.
     SECTION 5.02
Prevention or Delay in Performance by the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar or the Company.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar, any Transfer Agent, or the Company shall incur any liability to any holder of any Receipt, if by reason of any provision of any present or future law or regulation thereunder of the United States of America or of any other governmental authority or, in the case of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent or the Registrar or Transfer Agent, by reason of any provision, present or future, of the Certificate of Incorporation or, in the case of the Company, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar, by reason of any act of God or war or other circumstance beyond the control of the relevant party, the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Company shall be prevented or forbidden from doing or performing any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall be done or performed; nor shall the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, the Transfer Agent, any Registrar or the Company incur any liability to any holder of a Receipt by reason of any nonperformance or delay, caused as aforesaid, in the performance of any act or thing that the terms of this Deposit Agreement provide shall or may be done or performed, or by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for in this Deposit Agreement.
     SECTION 5.03
Obligations of the Depositary, the Depositary's Agents, the Registrar and the Company.
     The Company does not assume any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement or any Receipt to holders of Receipts other than from acts or omissions arising out of conduct constituting bad faith, negligence (in the case of any action or inaction with respect to the voting of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock), gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement. Neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or Registrar assumes any obligation or shall be subject to any liability under this Deposit Agreement to holders of Receipts, the Company or any other person or entity other than for its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful
 
misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Depositary, nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, lost profits, even if such person or entity alleged to be liable has knowledge of the possibility of such damages. Any liability of the Depositary and any Registrar or Transfer Agent under this Deposit Agreement will be limited to the amount of annual fees paid by the Company to the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any action, suit or other proceeding with respect to the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, Depositary Shares or Receipts that in its opinion may involve it in expense or liability, unless indemnity satisfactory to it against all expense and liability be furnished as often as may be required.
     None of the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent or the Company shall be liable for any action or any failure to act by it in reliance upon the advice of legal counsel or accountants, or information provided by any person presenting Convertible Preferred Stock for deposit or any holder of a Receipt. The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent and the Company may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.
     In the event the Depositary shall receive conflicting claims, requests or instructions from any holders of Receipts, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, the Depositary shall be entitled to act on such claims, requests or instructions received from the Company, and shall incur no liability and shall be entitled to the full indemnification set forth in Section 5.06 in connection with any action so taken.
     The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action does not result from bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Depositary (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). The Depositary undertakes, and any Registrar or Transfer Agent shall be required to undertake, to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Deposit Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.

The Depositary may also act as transfer agent or registrar of any of the securities of the Company and its affiliates or act in any other capacity for the Company or its affiliates.
 
     It is intended that neither the Depositary nor any Depositary's Agent shall be deemed to be an "issuer" of the securities under the federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws, it being expressly understood and agreed that the Depositary and any Depositary's Agent are acting only in a ministerial capacity as Depositary for the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock; , , that the Depositary agrees to comply with all information reporting and withholding requirements applicable to it under law or this Deposit Agreement in its capacity as Depositary.
provided
however
     Neither the Depositary (or its officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates) nor any Depositary's Agent makes any representation or has any responsibility as to the validity of the registration statement pursuant to which the Depositary Shares are registered under the Securities Act, the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares, the Receipts (except its countersignature thereon) or any instruments referred to therein or herein, or as to the correctness of any statement made therein or herein; , , that the Depositary is responsible for its representations in this Deposit Agreement.

     Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Deposit Agreement, the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively provided and established by a certificate signed by any one of the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer, any Assistant Treasurer, Head of Corporate Finance, the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar; and such certificate shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar and the Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Deposit Agreement in reliance upon such certificate. The Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar shall not be liable for or by
 
reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Deposit Agreement or in the Receipts (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
     The Depositary, the Depositary's Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar will not be under any duty or responsibility to ensure compliance with any applicable federal or state securities laws in connection with the issuance, transfer or exchange of the Receipts, Stock or Depositary Shares.
     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment to the Certificate of Designation shall affect the rights, duties, obligations or immunities of the Depositary, Transfer Agent, the Depositary's Agent or Registrar hereunder.
     The Depositary, Transfer Agent and any Registrar hereunder:
          (i) shall have no duties or obligations other than those specifically set forth herein (and no implied duties or obligations), or as may subsequently be agreed to in writing by the parties;
          (ii) shall have no obligation to make payment hereunder unless the Company shall have provided the necessary federal or other immediately available funds or securities or property, as the case may be, to pay in full amounts due and payable with respect thereto;
          (iii) shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder; if, however, the Depositary determines to take any legal or other action hereunder, and, where the taking of such action might in the Depositary's judgment subject or expose it to any expense or liability, the Depositary shall not be required to act unless it shall have been furnished with an indemnity satisfactory to it;
          (iv) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon any certificate, instrument, opinion, notice, letter, facsimile transmission or other document or security delivered to the Depositary and believed by the Depositary to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper party or parties, and shall have no responsibility for determining the accuracy thereof;
          (v) may rely on and shall be authorized and protected in acting or failing to act upon the written, telephonic, electronic and oral instructions, with respect to any matter relating to the Depositary's actions as depositary covered by this Deposit Agreement (or supplementing or qualifying any such actions) of officers of the Company;
          (vi) may consult counsel satisfactory to it, and the advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by the Depositary hereunder in accordance with the advice of such counsel;
          (vii) shall not be called upon at any time to advise any person with respect to the Depositary Shares or Receipts;
 
          (viii) shall not be liable or responsible for any recital or statement contained in any documents relating hereto or the Depositary Shares or Receipts; and
          (ix) shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties (other than with respect to the Depositary) executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Deposit Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for under this Deposit Agreement.
     The obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.03 shall survive the replacement, removal or resignation of any Depositary, Registrar, Transfer Agent or Depositary's Agent or termination of this Deposit Agreement.

     The Depositary may at any time be removed by the Company by notice of such removal delivered to the Depositary, such removal to take effect upon the appointment of a successor depositary and its acceptance of such appointment as hereinafter provided. Upon any such removal or appointment, the Company shall send notice thereof by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of Receipts.
     In case at any time the Depositary acting hereunder shall resign or be removed, the Company shall, within 60 days after the delivery of the notice of resignation or removal, as the case may be, appoint a successor depositary, which shall be an entity having its principal office in the United States of America and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If a successor depositary shall not have been appointed and have accepted appointment in 60 days, the resigning Depositary may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor depositary. Every successor depositary shall execute and deliver to its predecessor and to the Company an instrument in writing accepting its appointment hereunder, and thereupon such successor depositary, without any further act or deed, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor and for all purposes shall be the Depositary under this Deposit Agreement, and such predecessor, upon payment of all sums due it and on the written request of the Company, shall promptly execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor all rights and powers of such predecessor hereunder, shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all rights, title and interest in the deposited Convertible Preferred Stock and any moneys or property held hereunder to such successor and shall deliver to such successor a list of the record holders of all outstanding Receipts.

     SECTION 5.06
Indemnification by the Company.
     The Company shall indemnify the Depositary, any Depositary's Agent and any Transfer Agent or Registrar against, and hold each of them harmless from, any loss, liability, damage, cost or expense (including the costs and expenses of defending itself) which may arise out of (i) acts performed or omitted in connection with this Deposit Agreement and the Receipts (a) by the Depositary, any Transfer Agent or Registrar or any of their respective agents (including any Depositary's Agent), except for any liability arising out of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction) on the respective parts of any such person or persons, or (b) by the Company or any of its agents, or (ii) the offer, sale or registration of the Receipts or shares of Stock pursuant to the provisions hereof. The obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.06 shall survive the replacement, removal or resignation of any Depositary, Registrar, Transfer Agent or Depositary's Agent or termination of this Deposit Agreement. In no event shall the Depositary have any right of set off or counterclaim against the Depositary Shares or the Convertible Preferred Stock.
     SECTION 5.07

Receipt as custodian for DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in the DTC Receipt shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected through, records maintained by (i) DTC or its nominee for such DTC Receipt, or (ii) institutions that have accounts with DTC.

The DTC Receipt shall be in such form and shall bear such legend or legends as may be appropriate or required by DTC in order for it to accept the Depositary Shares for its book-entry settlement system.

     The Company shall prepare and provide the Depositary with such notice, and each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of deposited Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares to be redeemed; (iv) if fewer than all Depositary Shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the number of such Depositary Shares held by such holder to be so redeemed; (v) the place or places where the Preferred Stock and the Receipts evidencing Depositary Shares to be redeemed are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price; and (vi) that on the redemption date dividends in respect of the Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares to be redeemed will cease to accrue.
     In the event that notice of redemption has been made as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs and the Company shall then have paid in full to the Depositary the redemption price (determined pursuant to the Certificate of Designation) of the Preferred Stock deposited with the Depositary to be redeemed, the Depositary shall redeem the number of Depositary Shares representing such Preferred Stock so called for redemption by the Company and on the redemption date (unless the Company shall have failed to pay for the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed by it as set forth in the Company's notice provided for in the preceding paragraph), all dividends in respect of the shares of Preferred Stock called for redemption shall cease to accrue, the Depositary Shares called for redemption shall be deemed no longer to be outstanding and all rights of the holders of Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (except the right to receive the redemption price) shall, to the extent of such Depositary Shares, cease and terminate. Upon surrender in accordance with said notice of the Receipts evidencing such Depositary Shares (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Depositary shall so require), such Depositary Shares shall be redeemed at a cash redemption price of $25 per Depositary Share plus any accrued dividends thereon from the last Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the redemption date. The foregoing shall be further subject to the terms and conditions of the Certificate of Designation. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Deposit Agreement and the provisions of the Certificate of Designation, the provisions of the Certificate of Designation will govern and the Company will instruct the Depositary in writing accordingly of such governing terms; , , that under no circumstances will the Certificate of Designation be deemed to change or modify any of the rights, duties or immunities of the Depositary contained herein.

court process, the amount made available for distribution or distributed in respect of Depositary Shares represented by such Receipts subject to such withholding shall be reduced accordingly. The Depositary, however, shall distribute or make available for distribution, as the case may be, only such amount as can be distributed without attributing to any holder of Receipts a fraction of one cent. Any such fractional amounts shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent and so distributed to registered holders entitled thereto and any balance not so distributable shall be held by the Depositary (without liability for interest thereon) and shall be added to and be treated as part of the next succeeding distribution to record holders of such Receipts.

shall, subject to Section 3.01 and Section 3.02, be distributed by the Depositary to the record holders of Receipts entitled thereto as provided by Section 4.01 in the case of a distribution received in cash. The Depositary shall not make any distribution of such rights, preferences or privileges, unless the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel stating that such rights, preferences or privileges have been registered under the Securities Act or do not need to be registered.
     If registration under the Securities Act of the securities to which any rights, preferences or privileges relate is required in order for holders of Receipts to be offered or sold the securities to which such rights, preferences or privileges relate, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement, that it will promptly file a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act with respect to such rights, preferences or privileges and securities and use its commercially reasonable efforts and take all steps available to it to cause such registration statement to become effective sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges. In no event shall the Depositary make available to the holders of Receipts any right, preference or privilege to subscribe for or to purchase any securities unless and until such a registration statement shall have become effective or unless the offering and sale of such securities to such holders are exempt from registration under the provisions of the Securities Act and the Company shall have provided to the Depositary an opinion of counsel to such effect.
     If any other action under the law of any jurisdiction or any governmental or administrative authorization, consent or permit is required in order for such rights, preferences or privileges to be made available to holders of Receipts, the Company agrees that it will promptly notify the Depositary of such requirement and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action or obtain such authorization, consent or permit sufficiently in advance of the expiration of such rights, preferences or privileges to enable such holders to exercise such rights, preferences or privileges.
     The Depositary will not be deemed to have any knowledge of any item for which it is supposed to receive notification under any Section of this Deposit Agreement unless and until it has received such notification.
     SECTION 4.04
Notice of Dividends; Fixing of Record Date for Holders of Receipts.
     Whenever any cash dividend or other cash distribution shall become payable, any distribution other than cash shall be made, or any rights, preferences or privileges shall at any time be offered, with respect to the deposited Preferred Stock, or whenever the Depositary shall receive notice of (i) any meeting at which holders of such Preferred Stock are entitled to vote or of which holders of such Preferred Stock are entitled to notice or (ii) any election on the part of the Company to redeem any shares of such Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall in each such instance fix a record date (which shall be the same date as the record date fixed by the Company with respect to the Preferred Stock) for the determination of the holders of Receipts who shall be entitled to receive such dividend, distribution, rights, preferences or privileges or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at any such meeting or to receive notice of such meeting or whose Depositary Shares are to be so redeemed.

Voting Rights.
     Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of deposited Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the Depositary shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the record holders of Receipts a notice, which shall be provided by the Company and which shall contain (i) such information as is contained in such notice of meeting, (ii) a statement that the holders of Receipts at the close of business on a specified record date fixed pursuant to Section 4.04 will be entitled, subject to any applicable provision of law, to instruct the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the amount of Preferred Stock represented by their respective Depositary Shares and (iii) a brief statement as to the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of a holder of a Receipt on such record date, the Depositary shall insofar as practicable vote or cause to be voted the amount of Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt in accordance with the instructions set forth in such request. To the extent any such instructions request the voting of a fractional interest of a share of deposited Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall aggregate such interest with all other fractional interests resulting from requests with the same voting instructions and shall vote the number of whole votes resulting from such aggregation in accordance with the instructions received in such requests. Each share of Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote and, accordingly, each Depositary Share is entitled to 1/1000 of a vote. The Company hereby agrees to take all reasonable action that may be deemed necessary by the Depositary in order to enable the Depositary to vote such Preferred Stock or cause such Preferred Stock to be voted. In the absence of specific instructions from the holder of a Receipt, the Depositary will vote all Depositary Shares held by it in proportion with any instructions received. The Depositary shall not exercise any discretion in voting any Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares evidenced by such Receipt.

Changes Affecting Preferred Stock and Reorganization Events.
     Upon any change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or any other reclassification of the Preferred Stock, any Reorganization Event or any exchange of the Preferred Stock for cash, securities or other property, the Depositary shall, upon the written instructions of the Company setting forth any of the following adjustments, (i) reflect such adjustments in the Depositary's books and records in (a) the fraction of an interest represented by one Depositary Share in one share of Preferred Stock and (b) the ratio of the redemption price per Depositary Share to the redemption price of a share of Preferred Stock, as may be required by or as is consistent with the provisions of the Certificate of Designation to fully reflect the effects of such change in liquidation preference, par or stated value, split-up, combination or other reclassification of Preferred Stock, of such Reorganization Event or of such exchange and (ii) treat any shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) that shall be received by the Depositary in exchange for or in respect of the Preferred Stock as new deposited property under this Deposit Agreement, and Receipts then outstanding shall thenceforth represent the proportionate interests of holders thereof in the new deposited property so received in exchange for or in respect of such Preferred Stock. In any such case the Depositary may, upon the receipt of written request of the Company, execute and deliver additional Receipts, or may call for the surrender of all outstanding Receipts to be exchanged for new Receipts specifically describing such new deposited property.

     SECTION 4.09
Withholding.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Deposit Agreement, in the event that the Depositary determines that any distribution in property is subject to any tax or other governmental charge which the Depositary is obligated by law to withhold, the Depositary may dispose of, by public or private sale, all or a portion of such property in such amounts and in such manner as the Depositary deems necessary and practicable to pay such taxes, and the Depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of any such sale or the balance of any such property after deduction of such taxes to the holders of Receipts entitled thereto in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares held by them, respectively; , , that in the event the Depositary determines that such distribution of property is subject to withholding tax only with respect to some but not all holders of Receipts, the Depositary will use its best efforts (i) to sell only that portion of such property distributable to such holders that is required to generate sufficient proceeds to pay such withholding tax and (ii) to effect any such sale in such a manner so as to avoid affecting the rights of any other holders of Receipts to receive such distribution in property.

Such registrar (which may be the Registrar if so permitted by the requirements of such exchange) may be removed and a substitute registrar appointed by the Registrar upon the request or with the written approval of the Company. If the Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Preferred Stock are listed on one or more other stock exchanges, the Registrar will, at the request and expense of the Company, arrange such facilities for the delivery, transfer, surrender, redemption and exchange of such Receipts, such Depositary Shares or such Preferred Stock as may be required by law or applicable stock exchange regulations.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither the Depositary, nor any Depositary's Agent nor any Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, lost profits, even if such person or entity alleged to be liable has knowledge of the possibility of such damages. Any liability of the Depositary and any Registrar or Transfer Agent under this Deposit Agreement will be limited to the amount of annual fees paid by the Company to the Depositary or any Registrar or Transfer Agent.

The Depositary, any Depositary's Agent, any Registrar or Transfer Agent and the Company may each rely and shall each be protected in acting upon any written notice, request, direction or other document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

     The Depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to carry out any instruction to vote any of the deposited Preferred Stock or for the manner or effect of any such vote made, as long as any such action or non-action does not result from bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Depositary (which bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction).
