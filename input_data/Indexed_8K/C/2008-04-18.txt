Management Comment
 
"Our financial results reflect the continuation of the unprecedented market and credit environment and its impact on our historical risk positions. During the first quarter, valuations of our sub-prime related exposures in fixed income markets and leveraged finance assets have further declined and credit costs in our consumer lending businesses have increased. Despite the negative factors in the broader markets, we continue to see strong momentum throughout the organization with robust volumes in many of our products and regions," said Vikram Pandit, Chief Executive Officer of Citi.
 
"We have taken decisive and significant actions to strengthen our balance sheet, including over $30 billion of capital raised during December and January, a significant increase in our credit reserves, the sale of Redecard shares, the recently announced divestitures of CitiCapital and Diners Club International, and the realignment of and pending asset reductions in our mortgage business. We continue to enhance our risk management processes, our capital productivity and expense containment, as well as our ability to deliver innovative, world-class products that meet our clients' specific needs. To achieve this, we recently reorganized the businesses along regional and product lines to bring us closer to our clients.  At the same time, we are taking the necessary steps to make Citi more efficient while fostering a culture of accountability and teamwork."
 
"As we move into the second quarter and beyond, we will continue to divest non-strategic assets and allocate capital to the products and regions that will drive increased revenues, enhance the value of our franchise, and ultimately, maximize shareholder value," said Pandit.

Revenues
were $13.2 billion, down 48%, largely driven by significant write-downs in sub-prime related direct exposures in fixed income markets and highly leveraged finance commitments (discussed below).  Revenue growth in transaction services, global wealth management and global consumer was due to a combination of growth in business volumes, acquisitions and sales of non-strategic assets.  Double-digit revenue growth in Asia, Latin America and Japan was offset by revenue declines in the U.S. and EMEA.  The net interest margin increased 30 basis points versus the fourth quarter 2007.
 
                 
Global consumer revenues increased 16%, driven by an increase in international consumer revenues of 33%, which included a $663 million pre-tax gain on Redecard shares, and average deposit and loan growth of 23% and 30%, respectively.  U.S. consumer revenues were up 3%, driven by a $349 million pre-tax gain on Visa shares, and average deposit and managed loan growth of 4% and 9%, respectively.  Global consumer average deposits and managed loans grew 15% and 14%, respectively, and card purchase sales increased 13%.
 
                 
In markets & banking, securities and banking revenues were negative due to substantial write-downs and losses related to the fixed income and credit markets, including:
 
Write-downs of $6.0 billion on sub-prime related direct exposures. These exposures on December 31, 2007, were comprised of approximately $8.0 billion of gross lending and structuring exposures and approximately $29.3 billion of net ABS CDO super senior exposures (ABS CDO super senior gross exposures of $39.8 billion).  On March 31, 2008, these were comprised of approximately $6.4 billion of gross lending and structuring exposures and approximately $22.7 billion of net ABS CDO super senior exposures (ABS CDO super senior gross exposures of $33.2 billion). See detail in Schedule A on page 11.
                 
 
Write-downs of $3.1 billion, net of underwriting fees, on funded and unfunded highly leveraged finance commitments.
                 
 
Downward credit market value adjustments of $1.5 billion related to exposure to monoline insurers.
                 
 
Write-downs of $1.5 billion on auction rate securities inventory, due to failed auctions and deterioration in the credit markets.
                 
 
                 
Transaction services revenues were a record, up 42%, driven by strong growth in customer liability balances, up 33%, and assets under custody, up 21%.  Record revenues were achieved in all three businesses: cash management, securities services and trade.
 
                 
Global wealth management revenues grew 16%, mainly due to the consolidation of Nikko and double-digit revenue growth in the Private Bank.
 
                 
Alternative investments recorded negative revenue of $358 million, primarily due to the impact of market disruption on proprietary investments in hedge funds and SIV assets.
 
                 
Operating expenses
grew 4%, driven by acquisitions and other items including:
 
                 
Repositioning charges of $622 million.
 
                 
An expense benefit related to a legal vehicle restructuring in Mexico of $282 million.
 
                 
A reserve of $250 million related to facilitating the liquidation of investments in a Citi-managed fund for GWM clients.
 
                 
A write-down of $202 million of the multi-strategy hedge fund intangible asset related to Old Lane.
 
                 
A partial release of the Visa-related litigation reserve of $166 million.
Expense growth was also driven by higher business volumes.  The increase in expenses was offset partially by the absence of a $1.4 billion charge related to the structural expense review in the prior-year period.
 
of $6.0 billion consisted primarily of $3.8 billion in net credit losses and a $1.9 billion net charge to increase loan loss reserves.  The $3.0 billion increase in credit costs was driven primarily by higher net credit losses, up $1.7 billion, and an incremental net charge to increase loan loss reserves of $1.3 billion.
                 
Credit costs
 
                 
In U.S. consumer, higher credit costs reflected an increase in net credit losses of $1.1 billion and an incremental net charge to increase loan loss reserves of $1.2 billion.  The increase in credit costs primarily reflected a weakening of leading credit indicators, including higher delinquencies on first and second mortgages, unsecured personal loans, credit cards and auto loans.  Credit costs also increased due to trends in the U.S. macro-economic environment, including the housing market downturn and rising unemployment rates, as well as portfolio growth.
 
                 
In international consumer, higher credit costs reflected an increase in net credit losses of $461 million and an incremental net charge to increase loan loss reserves of $312 million.  The increase in credit costs was primarily driven by Mexico cards and India consumer finance, as well as by acquisitions and portfolio growth.
 
                 
Markets & banking credit costs decreased by $5 million.  Credit costs included an increase in net credit losses of $123 million, an incremental net charge of $157 million to increase loan loss reserves for specific counterparties, and the absence of a $290 million net charge to increase loan loss reserves in the prior-year period.
 
               
Taxes
.
  The effective tax rate on continuing operations was 43.1% versus 26.9% in the prior-year period.  The increase in the tax rate was due largely to higher tax rates in the jurisdictions where the losses were incurred.
 
               
Capital raise.
  In January 2008, Citi raised $19.
5 billion of capital, significantly strengthening its capital position.
 
               
Summary of highlighted items.
  During the quarter, the following charges and benefits were recorded.  See Schedule A on page 11 for detail on write-downs and losses on sub-prime related direct exposures in securities and banking:

U.S. Consumer
 
Revenues grew 3% due to a 4% increase in average deposits, a 9% increase in average managed loans and a $349 million pre-tax gain on Visa shares, offset by lower securitization results in cards.  Excluding the gain on Visa shares and a $161 million pre-tax gain on the sale of MasterCard shares in the first quarter of 2007, revenues were up 1%.  Expenses increased 6%, driven by acquisitions and a repositioning charge of $131 million, partially offset by a $159 million release of the Visa-related litigation reserve.  Credit costs increased $2.3 billion, primarily reflecting a weakening of leading credit indicators, including higher delinquencies on mortgages, unsecured personal loans, credit cards and auto loans.  Credit costs also increased due to trends in the U.S. macro-economic environment, including the housing market downturn and rising unemployment rates, as well as portfolio growth.
 
                 
U.S. Cards
 
GAAP revenues decreased 2%, reflecting the impact of higher funding costs and higher credit losses in the securitization trusts, partially offset by the gain on Visa shares.

Expenses increased 6%, reflecting higher business volumes and branch openings.
                 
 
Credit costs increased $591 million, driven by higher net credit losses and a $362 million pre-tax charge to increase loan loss reserves.  Higher credit costs reflected a weakening of leading credit indicators, including higher delinquencies in the retail bank home equity portfolio and unsecured personal loans, as well as portfolio growth.  The net credit loss ratio increased 97 basis points to 3.82%.

Revenues increased 10%, driven by growth in net interest revenues of 8%, reflecting 8% growth in average loans.
                 
 
Expenses grew 53%, driven by acquisitions, increased business volumes, higher collection expenses and a repositioning charge.
                 
 
Credit costs increased $1.2 billion, driven by higher net credit losses, up $762 million, and a $659 million pre-tax charge to increase loan loss reserves.  These increases reflected a weakening of leading credit indicators, including higher delinquencies in first and second mortgages and auto loans.  Credit costs also reflected trends in the macroeconomic environment, including the housing market downturn.
                 
 
The higher expenses and credit costs led to a net loss of $476 million.
                 
 
                 
U.S. Commercial Business

Revenues increased 33%, driven by organic growth, the impact of recent acquisitions, a $663 million pre-tax gain on Redecard shares, and a $97 million pre-tax gain on Visa shares.  Excluding the gains on Redecard and Visa shares, as well as a gain on sale of MasterCard shares in the prior-year period, revenues increased 22%.   Revenue growth was offset partially by a decline in Japan consumer finance.  Average deposits and loans were up 23% and 30%, respectively.

International Consumer Finance
 
In Japan, revenues declined by 29% driven by lower interest revenue and higher refund claims.  The net loss of $69 million reflected the difficult operating environment and the ongoing impact of consumer lending laws passed in the fourth quarter 2006.
                 
 
Outside of Japan, revenues increased 10%, driven by average loan growth of 14%.  The net loss of $99 million mainly was due to an increase in credit costs of 92%, primarily driven by India, and a repositioning charge.

NM  Not meaningful.
 
                 
Securities and Banking
 
Securities and banking revenues were negative $6.8 billion due to substantial write-downs and losses related to the fixed income and credit markets.  Revenues included a $1.3 billion gain related to the inclusion of Citi's credit spreads in the determination of the market value of those liabilities for which the fair value option was elected.
                 
 
Fixed income markets revenues were a negative $6.9 billion driven by:
                 
 
Write-downs of $6.0 billion on sub-prime related direct exposures. These exposures on December 31, 2007 were comprised of approximately $8.0 billion of gross lending and structuring exposures and approximately $29.3 billion of net ABS CDO super senior exposures (ABS CDO super senior gross exposures of $39.8 billion).  On March 31, 2008, these were comprised of approximately $6.4 billion of gross lending and structuring exposures and approximately $22.7 billion of net ABS CDO super senior exposures (ABS CDO super senior gross exposures of $33.2 billion). See detail in Schedule A on page 11.
               
 
Downward credit market value adjustments of $1.5 billion related to exposure to monoline insurers.

Write-downs of $1.0 billion, net of hedges, on Alt-A mortgages.
               
 
Write-downs of $0.6 billion on commercial real estate positions.
               
 
Negative revenues were partially offset by record revenues in foreign exchange and local emerging markets.
 
Equity markets revenues decreased 34% to $979 million.  Strong customer flows and continued growth in equity finance were offset by weakness in proprietary trading and convertibles.
                 
 
Lending revenues increased 2% to $584 million, primarily driven by gains on credit default swap hedges, which were partially offset by write-downs of $739 million, net of underwriting fees, on funded and unfunded highly leveraged finance commitments.
                 
 
Net investment banking revenues were negative $1.7 billion due to write-downs of $2.3 billion, net of underwriting fees, on funded and unfunded highly leveraged finance commitments.
                 
 
Advisory revenues were down 28%, driven by market conditions.  For the first quarter 2008, Citi ranked #2 in global announced M&A.
               
Equity underwriting revenues were down 56%, as capital markets activity decreased, due to difficult market conditions.
               
 
Debt underwriting revenues were negative $2.1 billion, driven by the write-downs of $2.3 billion of highly leveraged finance commitments referenced above.
               
 
Operating expenses decreased 2%, reflecting a decline in incentive compensation costs, partially offset by a repositioning charge of $295 million.
                 
 
Securities and banking credit costs decreased by $2 million.  Credit costs included increased net credit losses of $126 million, an incremental net charge of $157 million to increase loan loss reserves for specific counterparties, and the absence of a $290 million net charge to increase loan loss reserves in the prior-year period.
                 
 
                 
Transaction Services
 
Revenues increased 42% to a record $2.3 billion, driven by higher customer volumes, continued sales momentum, improved net interest margin, and the acquisition of The Bisys Group.  Revenues grew at a double-digit pace in Japan, Latin America, Asia, U.S. and EMEA.
                 
 
Liability balances grew 32% and assets under custody were up 21%.
                 
 
Operating expenses increased 25%, primarily driven by increased business volumes and Bisys.
                 
 
Net income increased 63% to a record $732 million.

Smith Barney
 
Revenue growth of 18% reflected 17% growth in client assets under fee-based management, primarily driven by acquisitions.
                 
 
Expenses grew 38%, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions, a reserve related to facilitating the liquidation of investments in a Citi-managed fund for its clients, and increased customer activity.
                 
 
Credit costs increased $11 million, driven by Asia.
                 
 
Net income decreased 56%, due to higher expenses and credit costs.
                 
 
                 
Private Bank
 
Revenue growth of 10% was driven by a 15% increase in U.S. revenues, as strong business volumes were partially offset by net interest margin compression.  International revenues increased 8%, reflecting growth in structured lending products.
                 
 
Client business volumes increased 9%, including higher client assets under fee-based management, up 7%, and loans and unused commitments, up 33%.
                 
 
Expense growth of 6% primarily reflected a reserve related to facilitating the liquidation of investments in a Citi-managed fund for its clients and a repositioning charge.
                 
 
Net income increased 27% driven by increased customer activity.
                 
 
ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
 
 
NM Not meaningful.
                 
Alternative Investments
 
Alternative Investments recorded negative revenues of $358 million on sharply lower proprietary revenues and a $212 million mark-to-market loss on SIV assets.  The net loss was driven by the lower revenues and a $202 million write-down of the multi-strategy hedge fund intangible asset related to Old Lane.
                 
 
Corporate/Other income improved $248 million.  The current period included a $212 million pre-tax write-down of an equity investment held by Nikko Cordial.  The prior-year period included a $1.4 billion charge related to a structural expense review, partially offset by a gain on the sale of certain corporate-owned assets.

Mexico
 
Consumer revenue growth of 6% was driven by 21% growth in average loans and 19% growth in investment AUMs, partially offset by the absence of a gain on sale of MasterCard shares in the prior-year period. Higher credit costs were mostly driven by a net charge to increase loan loss reserves in cards, where receivables grew 24% over the last year, reflecting target market expansion.  Net income declined as higher revenues and an expense benefit related to a legal vehicle restructuring were more than offset by higher credit costs, primarily in the cards business.
                 
 
Markets & banking revenues and net income decreased as strong revenue and net income in transaction services were offset by lower results in securities and banking.  In securities and banking, revenues declined 17%, driven by lower revenues in fixed income markets and underwriting, lower results in lending,
                 
and volatile foreign exchange rates.  Transaction services revenues increased 7%, driven by strong growth in business volumes.
 
                 
Europe, Middle East and Africa
 
Consumer revenues increased 29%, driven by growth in average loans and deposits, up 48% and 49%, respectively.  Investment AUMs also increased by 15%.  Net income decreased mainly due to a repositioning charge.
                 
 
Markets & banking results reflected $1.4 billion of write-downs and credit costs on sub-prime related direct exposures and $461 million of write-downs related to highly leveraged finance commitments, both in securities and banking.  Revenues in securities and banking also included strong performance in fixed income emerging markets and foreign exchange.  The write-downs more than offset record revenues and net income in transaction services, which grew at a double-digit pace, driven by increased customer volumes and deposit growth.
                 
 
Wealth management revenue growth was driven by increases in banking, capital markets products and structured lending.
                 
 
                 
Japan
 
Consumer results were driven by double-digit growth in cards and retail banking, including the impact from an acquisition, offset by continued weakness in consumer finance.  Consumer finance net income declined due to higher refund claims, lower receivables, and an increase in the net credit loss ratio.
                 
 
Markets & banking results decreased in securities and banking, partially offset by strong results in transaction services.  Securities and banking results were primarily driven by mark-to-market losses in Nikko Cordial, and decreases in fixed income underwriting and equity markets.  Transaction services showed double-digit revenue growth across all products.
                 
 
Wealth management results reflected the consolidation of Nikko.
                 
 
                 
Asia
 
Consumer revenues increased 24%, driven by growth in average loans, up 22%, and average customer deposits, up 14%, as well as by an increase in investment AUMs of 13%.  The decline in net income reflected higher expenses associated with increased collection efforts, primarily in India, and branch openings, as well as higher credit costs in India consumer finance.
                 
 
Markets & banking revenues and net income increased 30% and 29%, respectively.  Securities and banking revenues increased 22%, driven by record fixed income markets, particularly in rates and currencies, and by strong results in equity markets.  Transaction services revenues and net income grew at a double-digit pace, reflecting increased business volumes and balances.
                 
 
Wealth management results were lower due to a decrease in capital markets revenue, mainly in structured products.

Consumer revenue and net income growth was driven by higher average loans and deposits, up 72% and a 69%, respectively, as well as by growth in investment AUMs. Results include the impact of acquisitions and a $661 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Redecard shares.
                 
 
Markets & banking revenues grew 9% and net income increased 7%, as strong results in transaction services were offset partially by declines in securities and banking, primarily due to weakness in fixed income underwriting, equity markets and advisory.

(1) Primarily backed by older vintage high grade ABS CDOs. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the CDOs that collateralized the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) were consolidated on Citi's balance sheet. 
 
(2) Comprised of net CDO Super Senior exposures and gross Lending and Structuring exposures.
(3) FAS 157 adjustment related to counterparty credit risk.
(4) Includes $79 million recorded in credit costs.
 
Citi's CDO Super Senior sub-prime direct exposures are subject to valuation based on an intrinsic cash flow methodology and not based on observable transactions.  During the course of the first quarter the methodology has been refined, and inputs used for the purposes of estimation have been modified to reflect market developments.  The methodology takes into account both macroeconomic factors, including estimated housing price adjustments over the next four years, unemployment rates, interest rates and their volatility, and microeconomic factors, including loan attributes, such as age, credit scores, documentation status, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.  In addition, the methodology takes account of estimates of the impact of geographic concentration of mortgages, estimated impact of reported fraud in the origination of sub-prime mortgages and the application of discount rates for each level of exposures.
 
Estimates of the fair value of the CDO Super Senior exposures depend on market conditions and are subject to further change over time.  In addition, while Citi believes that the methodology used to value these exposures is reasonable, the methodology is subject to continuing refinement, including as a result of market developments.  Further, if observable transactions in respect of some or all of these exposures occur in the future, these observable transactions, rather than estimates, could be used to determine fair value.
 
Most of the lending and structuring direct sub-prime exposures are fair valued based on observable transactions and other market data.  The majority of such exposures are classified as Level 3 assets.
 
Securities and banking also has trading positions, both long and short, in U.S. sub-prime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and related products, including ABS CDOs, that are not included in these figures.  The exposure from these positions is actively managed and hedged, although the effectiveness of the hedging products used may vary with material changes in market conditions.
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The following are measures considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC guidelines:
 
U.S. Consumer revenues excluding the gain on Visa and MasterCard shares.
1)
             
U.S. Cards revenues excluding the gain on Visa and MasterCard shares.
2)
             
U.S. Cards revenues excluding the net impact of credit card securitization activity.
3)
             
International Consumer revenues excluding the gains on Redecard, Visa and MasterCard shares.
4)
             
International Cards revenues excluding the gains on Redecard, Visa and MasterCard shares.
5)
             
 
The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of those results in prior periods as well as demonstrating the effects of unusual gains and charges in the quarter.  The Company believes that a meaningful analysis of its financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance.  The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the Company's underlying performance.
 
Reconciliation of the GAAP financial measures to the aforementioned non-GAAP measures follows:

GAAP revenues decreased 2%, reflecting the impact of higher funding costs and higher credit losses in the securitization trusts, partially offset by the gain on Visa shares.  Excluding the gain on Visa shares and a gain on MasterCard shares in the first quarter of 2007, revenues were down 8%. 
                 
Managed revenues grew 14% reflecting, the gain on Visa shares and a 6% increase in managed receivables. The managed net interest margin increased 3 basis points to 10.14%. 
                 
Expenses decreased by 6%, primarily driven by a partial release of the Visa-related litigation reserve, offset by increased collection and servicing expenses.
                 
Credit costs increased $447 million, driven by higher net credit losses, up 23%, and a $302 million pre-tax charge to increase loan loss reserves.  Higher credit costs reflected a weakening of leading credit indicators, trends in the macro-economic environment and an increase in the rate at which delinquent customers advanced to write-off.  The managed net credit loss ratio increased by 120 basis points to 5.83%.   
                 
Net income declined 34%, driven largely by increased credit costs.
