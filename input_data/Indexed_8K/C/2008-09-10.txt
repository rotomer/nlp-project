As of September 8, 2008, Citis net exposure to the preferred and convertible preferred shares of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) was approximately $50 million. Citi holds this exposure primarily in its Institutional Clients Group trading account, which is marked-to-market through revenues. The quarter-to-date pre-tax impact on revenues from trading losses and write-downs of this exposure is approximately $450 million. The exposure, which stood at approximately $1 billion at June 30, 2008, has been reduced substantially during the quarter through sales, hedges and write-downs. The final impact on Citis quarterly financial results could differ from the quarter-to-date impact disclosed above.
Citi also has an insignificant amount of net exposure to the common shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
