Deposit sweep accounts (and related deposits) of customers with accounts at both contributed businesses and all deposit sweep accounts of Joint Venture customers who become customers of the Joint Venture after closing will be allocated to Citi and Morgan Stanley pro rata according to their relative ownership interest in the Joint Venture.  Upon a reduction in Citis ownership percentage upon the exercise of any put or call rights pursuant to the LLC Agreement, balances in deposit sweep accounts of Joint Venture customers who had accounts at both contributed businesses or became customers of the Joint Venture after the consummation of the transaction will be rebalanced between Citi and Morgan Stanley to reflect the new relative ownership percentages.  Citis rights and obligations under the Deposit Sweep Agreement may be terminated by any party upon consummation of a call or put pursuant to the LLC Agreement that results in Citi ceasing to own any common equity interest in the Joint Venture.  Following termination of the Deposit Sweep Agreement, all deposit sweep accounts (and related deposits) of Joint Venture customers then held by Citi will be transferred to Morgan Stanley over a two-year transition period.  Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the consideration payable to Citi upon exercise of the applicable call or put will include a payment for the fair market value of the applicable deposits transferred to Morgan Stanley.
Each of Citi and Morgan Stanley will enter into a Distribution Agreement with the Joint Venture that will provide for Citi and Morgan Stanley to use the Joint Venture as their preferred channel for distribution of certain product offerings to retail customers.  The Distribution Agreements will terminate after 5 years, subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances.
Each of Citi and Morgan Stanley will enter into a Research Agreement with the Joint Venture that will provide for Citi and Morgan Stanley to provide research on the same basis as current practice to the Joint Venture for use by the Joint Ventures financial advisors and customers.  Each Research Agreement will terminate concurrently with the termination of the Distribution Agreement between the Joint Venture and Citi or Morgan Stanley, as applicable.
Each of Citi and Morgan Stanley will enter into an Order Flow Agreement with the Joint Venture that will provide for the Joint Venture to route orders generated by the Joint Venture to each of Citi and Morgan Stanley for execution at substantially the same level that Citi and Morgan Stanley currently receive from their respective contributed businesses, subject to applicable best execution requirements.  The Order Flow Agreements will also provide for Citi and Morgan Stanley to have substantially the same access to securities lending by the Joint Venture that Citi
 
 
and Morgan Stanley currently receive from their respective contributed businesses.  The Order Flow Agreement with Citi will also provide for the continuation of the relationship between the Joint Ventures financial advisors and Citis specialized product liaisons in the areas of Municipal Securities and Taxable Fixed Income Securities for at least a 3-year period.  The Order Flow Agreements will terminate after 6 years, subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances.
Each of Citi and Morgan Stanley will enter into a Transition Services Agreement with the Joint Venture that will provide for Citi and Morgan Stanley to provide certain transition services to the Joint Venture, and for the Joint Venture to provide certain transition services to Citi and Morgan Stanley.  Transition services will generally be provided for up to 3 years, subject to certain exceptions.
Citi and Morgan Stanley have agreed to certain general principles regarding the parties intended treatment of Citi and Morgan Stanley employees who transfer to the Joint Venture with respect to compensation and benefits, including the manner of allocating the cost of compensation and benefits and that the Joint Venture will bear such costs accrued after the Closing.  Citi, Morgan Stanley and the Joint Venture will enter into an Employee Matters Agreement pursuant to which the parties will take specified actions to reflect such agreed upon principles.
