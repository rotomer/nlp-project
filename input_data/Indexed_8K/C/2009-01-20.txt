Item 5.02.  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On January 14, 2009, the Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Citigroup Inc. (the Committee) made compensatory awards to members of senior management.  Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit, Chairman of the Board Sir Winfried Bischoff, and Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden declined to be considered for incentive or retention awards and did not receive any of the awards described below.
The other members of Citis executive committee received stock awards that vest if the price of shares of Citigroup Inc. common stock meets specified price targets during the next four years.  Half of each individuals award has a price target of $17.85 and half has a price target of $10.61.  These price levels were chosen based on the conversion prices of the warrants to purchase common stock issued by Citigroup to the U.S. Department of the Treasury on October 28, 2008 and on December 31, 2008.
These members of the executive committee also received premium priced stock options, which have a 10-year term and will vest ratably over four years.  Half of each individuals grant has an exercise price of $17.85 and the other half has an exercise price of $10.61.
On January 14, 2009 and January 20, 2009, awards were made under the Citigroup Inc. Deferred Cash Award Plan for the benefit of eligible Citi employees primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. with incentive compensation in excess of $100,000.  These awards vest ratably over a four-year period and earn interest during the vesting period at the 90-day LIBOR rate.  The other terms of these awards are substantially the same as the terms of equity awards made under Citis Capital Accumulation Plan.
On January 20, 2009, the Committee terminated the 1999 Executive Performance Plan (the Plan), effective for the 2009 compensation year.  The Plan provided for the federal income tax deduction of performance based compensation awards under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and recent changes in tax laws limiting tax deductible executive compensation have superseded the need for the Plan.
The above summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Exhibits hereto.  The complete terms of the awards described above are contained in the Exhibits hereto, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Prospectus
By accepting an Award, Participant acknowledges that he or she has read and understands the Prospectus and the terms and conditions set forth in this Appendix.  Participant understands that this Award is entirely discretionary and that no right to receive the Award, or any other award, exists absent a prior written agreement to the contrary.
Participant understands that the value that may be realized from an Award, if any, is contingent and depends on the future market price of Citigroup stock, among other factors, and that because equity awards are discretionary, and intended to promote employee retention and stock ownership and to align employees interests with those of stockholders, equity awards are subject to vesting conditions and will be canceled if vesting conditions are not satisfied.
Any monetary value assigned to an Award in any communication regarding the Award is contingent, hypothetical, and for illustrative purposes only and does not express or imply any promise or intent by the Company to deliver, directly or indirectly, any certain or determinable cash value to Participant.  Receipt of an Award covered by this Agreement, or any other incentive award, is neither an indication nor a guarantee that an incentive award of any type or amount will be made in the future, and absent a written agreement to the contrary, the Company is free to change its practices and policies regarding incentive awards at any time in its sole discretion.
Any actual, anticipated, or estimated financial benefit to Participant from an Award is not and shall not be deemed to be a normal or an integral part of Participants regular or expected salary or compensation from employment for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any statutory, common law or other severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments, and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company.
2. Vesting and Share Delivery.
Except as provided otherwise in Section 4 of this Agreement, Participant may vest in all or a portion of an Award by remaining employed by the Company until the earlier to occur of one or both of the vesting dates described in Sections 2(a)(i), or the vesting date described in Section 2(a)(ii) (each a ).

The Trigger Price Condition will be met if the New York Stock Exchange () closing price of Citigroup stock equals or exceeds the applicable Trigger Price on 20 trading days in any period of 30 consecutive NYSE trading days ending on or before the Award Termination Date.  If the NYSE is not open for trading on the Award Termination Date, the immediately preceding trading day shall be considered the Award Termination Date.

Treasury and the Company a waiver releasing the U.S. Treasury and the Company from any claims that Participant may otherwise have as a result of the issuance of any regulations which adversely modify the terms of an Award that would not otherwise comply with the executive compensation and corporate governance requirements of EESA or any securities purchase agreement or other agreement entered into between the Company and the U.S. Treasury pursuant to EESA.

By accepting an Award, Participant acknowledges that he or she has read and understands the Prospectus and the terms and conditions set forth in this Appendix.  Participant understands that this Award and all other awards are entirely discretionary and that no right to receive the Award, or any award, exists absent a prior written agreement to the contrary.
Participant understands that the value that may be realized from an Award, if any, is contingent and depends on the future market price of Citigroup stock, among other factors, and that because equity awards are discretionary, and intended to promote employee retention and stock ownership and to align employees interests with those of stockholders, equity awards are subject to vesting conditions and will be canceled if vesting conditions are not satisfied.
Any monetary value assigned to an Award in any communication regarding the Award is contingent, hypothetical, and for illustrative purposes only and does not express or imply any promise or intent by the Company to deliver, directly or indirectly, any certain or determinable cash value to Participant.  Receipt of an Award covered by this Agreement, or any other award, is neither an indication nor a guarantee that an award of any type or amount will be made in the future, and absent a written agreement to the contrary, the Company is free to change its practices and policies regarding discretionary awards at any time in its sole discretion.
Any actual, anticipated, or estimated financial benefit to Participant from an Award is not and shall not be deemed to be a normal or an integral part of Participants regular or expected salary or compensation from employment for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculating any statutory, common law or other severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments, and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company.
