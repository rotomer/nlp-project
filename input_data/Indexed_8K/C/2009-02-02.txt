CITIGROUP INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum of $_____________ on April 30, 2012and to pay interest thereon from and including January 30, 2009 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually, on April 30 and October 30 of each year, commencing April 30, 2009, at the rate of 2.125% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.  The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such interest, which shall be the April 15 and October 15 (whether or not a Business Day) immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date.
 
Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holder on such Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on a subsequent Record Date, such subsequent Record Date to be not less than five days prior to the date of payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to holders of Notes of this series not less than 15 days prior to such subsequent Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Notes of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
 
 
 
 
Interest hereon will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.
If either an Interest Payment Date or the Maturity of the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date or Maturity will be the next succeeding Business Day.  If a date for payment of interest or principal on the Notes falls on a day that is not a business day in the place of payment, such payment will be made on the next succeeding business day in such place of payment as if made on the date the payment was due.  No interest will accrue on any amounts payable for the period from and after the due date for payment of such principal or interest.

Any holder may elect not to be represented by the Representative by providing written notice of such election to the Representative.
Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Trustee maintained for that purpose in The City of New York.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company (the "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under the Indenture, dated as of March 15, 1987 (as amended and supplemented to date, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, formerly known as The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially limited in aggregate principal to $8,000,000,000.
If an event of default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to Notes of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture; provided, however, that no acceleration of the amounts due on the Notes of this series will be permitted at any time that the FDIC is making timely guarantee payments on the Notes of this series in accordance with the Debt Guarantee Program.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Note upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in Sections 11.03 and 11.04 thereof, which provisions apply to this Note.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, without the consent of the holders of the Securities, to establish, among other things, the form and terms of any series of Securities issuable thereunder by one or more supplemental indentures, and, with the consent of the holders of not less than 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of Securities at the time outstanding which are affected thereby, to modify the Indenture or any supplemental indenture or the rights of the holders of Securities of such series to be affected, provided that no such modification will (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Securities, reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, reduce the principal amount thereof or the premium, if any, thereon, reduce the amount of the principal of Original Issue Discount Securities payable on any date, change the currency in which Securities are payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the maturity thereof, without the consent of the holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities of any series the consent of the holders of which is required for any such modification without the consent of the holders of all Securities of such series then outstanding, or (iii) modify, without the written consent of the Trustee, the rights, duties or immunities of the Trustee; provided further that the express written consent of the FDIC will be required to amend, modify or waive any provision of the Indenture or any supplemental indenture relating to principal, interest, default or ranking provisions of the Notes, any provision of the Notes that is required to be included in connection with the Debt Guarantee Program, or any other provision the amendment of which would require the consent of any or all of the holders of the Notes.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
This Note is a Global Security registered in the name of a nominee of the Depository.  This Note is exchangeable for Notes registered in the name of a person other than the Depository or its nominee only in the limited circumstances hereinafter described.  Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for definitive Notes in certificated form, this Note may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository.
The Notes represented by this Global Security are exchangeable for definitive Notes in certificated form of like tenor as such Notes in denominations of $1,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof only if (i) the Depository notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for the Notes or (ii) the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or (iii) the Company in its sole discretion decides to allow the Notes to be exchanged for definitive Notes in registered form.  Any Notes that are exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence are exchangeable for certificated Notes issuable in authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Depository shall direct.  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of definitive Notes in certificated form is registrable in the register maintained by the Company in The City of New York for such purpose, upon surrender of the definitive Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the registrar, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the registrar duly executed by, the holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.  Subject to the foregoing, this Note is not exchangeable, except for a Global Security or Global Securities of this issue of the same principal amount to be registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Company will pay additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") to the beneficial owner of any Note that is a non-United States person in order to ensure that every net payment on such Note will not be less, due to payment of U.S. withholding tax, than the amount then due and payable.  For this purpose, a "net payment" on a Note means a payment by the Company or a paying agent, including payment of principal and interest, after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge of the United States. These Additional Amounts will constitute additional interest on the Note.

The Company will not be required to pay Additional Amounts, however, in any of the circumstances described in items (1) through (13) below.
For purposes of items (1) through (4) above, "beneficial owner" means a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the holder if the holder is an estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, corporation or other entity, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder.

As used in this Note, "United States person" means:
Additionally, "non-United States person" means a person who is not a United States person, and "United States" means the states of the United States of America and the District of Columbia, but excluding its territories and its possessions.
Except as provided below, the Notes may not be redeemed prior to maturity.
Any redemption of the Notes as set forth in clauses (1) or (2) above shall be in whole, and not in part, and will be made at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes Outstanding plus accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption.  Holders shall be given not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior notice by the Trustee of the date fixed for such redemption.
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.  The Notes are governed by the laws of the State of New York.

Interest hereon will be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in an Interest Period and a 360-day year.  Dollar amounts resulting from such calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.  An "Interest Period" shall be the period from and including an Interest Payment Date (or from December 9, 2008 in the case of the first Interest Payment Date) to and including the day immediately preceding the next Interest Payment Date.
If an Interest Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date will be the next succeeding Business Day.  If the Maturity of the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the payment due on Maturity will be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, and no further interest will accrue in respect of such postponement.  If a date for payment of interest or principal on the Notes falls on a day that is not a business day in the place of payment, such payment will be made on the next succeeding business day in such place of payment as if made on the date the payment was due.  No interest will accrue on any amounts payable for the period from and after the due date for payment of such principal or interest.
For these purposes, Business Day means any day which is a day on which commercial banks settle payments and are open for general business in The City of New York.
Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note will be made at the office or agency of the Trustee maintained for that purpose in The City of New York.

This is one of the Notes of the series issued under the within-mentioned Indenture.
Dated:  January 30, 2009
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Securities of the Company (the "Notes"), issued and to be issued in one or more series under the Indenture, dated as of March 15, 1987 (as amended and supplemented to date, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and of the terms upon which the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  This Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof, initially issued in the aggregate principal amount of $1,250,000,000 and increased to $1,350,000,000.
This Note will bear interest for each Interest Period at a rate determined by Citibank, N.A., acting as Calculation Agent.  The interest rate on this Note for a particular Interest Period will be a per annum rate equal to three-month LIBOR as determined on the related Interest Determination Date, plus 0.55%.  The Interest Determination Date for an Interest Period will be the second London business day preceding such Interest Period.  The Interest Determination Date for the first Interest Period was December 5, 2008.  Promptly upon determination, the Calculation Agent will inform the Trustee and the Company of the interest rate for the next Interest Period.  Absent manifest error, the determination of the interest rate by the Calculation Agent shall be binding and conclusive on the holders of Notes, the Trustee and the Company.
A London business day is a day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
On any Interest Determination Date, LIBOR will be equal to the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of six months for the next Interest Period, in amounts of at least $1,000,000, as such rate appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Interest Determination Date.  If the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 is replaced by another service or ceases to exist, the Calculation Agent will use the replacing service or such other service that may be nominated by the British Bankers' Association for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits.
If no offered rate appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 on an Interest Determination Date at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, then the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) will select four major banks in the London interbank market and shall request each of their principal London offices to provide a quotation of the rate at which six-month deposits in U.S. dollars in amounts of at least $1,000,000 are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, on that date and at that time, that is representative of single transactions at that time.  If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided.  Otherwise, the Calculation Agent will select three major banks in New York City and shall request each of them to provide a quotation of the rate offered by them at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Interest Determination Date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of six months for the applicable Interest Period in an amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative of single transactions at that time.  If three quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided.  Otherwise, the rate of LIBOR for the next Interest Period will be set equal to the rate of LIBOR for the current Interest Period.
The Luxembourg Stock Exchange shall be notified of the interest rate, the amount of the interest payment and the Interest Payment Date for a particular Interest Period not later than the first day of such Interest Period.  Upon request from any Noteholder, the Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate in effect on this Note for the current Interest Period and, if it has been determined, the interest rate to be in effect for the next Interest Period.
If an event of default (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to Notes of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture; provided, however, that no acceleration of the amounts due on the Notes of this series will be permitted at any time that the FDIC is making timely guarantee payments on the Notes of this series in accordance with the Debt Guarantee Program.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire indebtedness of this Note upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in Sections 11.03 and 11.04 thereof, which provisions apply to this Note.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, without the consent of the holders of the Securities, to establish, among other things, the form and terms of any series of Securities issuable thereunder by one or more supplemental indentures, and, with the consent of the holders of not less than 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of Securities at the time outstanding which are affected thereby, to modify the Indenture or any supplemental indenture or the rights of the holders of Securities of such series to be affected, provided that no such modification will (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Securities, reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, reduce the principal amount thereof or the premium, if any, thereon, reduce the amount of the principal of Original Issue Discount Securities payable on any date, change the currency in which Securities are payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the maturity thereof, without the consent of the holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities of any series the consent of the holders of which is required for any such modification without the consent of the holders of all Securities of such series then outstanding, or (iii) modify, without the written consent of the Trustee, the rights, duties or immunities of the Trustee; provided further that the express written consent of the FDIC will be required to amend, modify or waive any provision of the Indenture or any supplemental indenture relating to principal, interest, default or ranking provisions of the Notes, any provision of the Notes that is required to be included in connection with the Debt Guarantee Program, or any other provision the amendment of which would require the consent of any or all of the holders of the Notes.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
 
 
 
This Note is a Global Security registered in the name of a nominee of the Depository.  This Note is exchangeable for Notes registered in the name of a person other than the Depository or its nominee only in the limited circumstances hereinafter described.  Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for definitive Notes in certificated form, this Note may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository.
The Notes represented by this Global Security are exchangeable for definitive Notes in certificated form of like tenor as such Notes in denominations of $1,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof only if (i) the Depository notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for the Notes or (ii) the Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or (iii) the Company in its sole discretion decides to allow the Notes to be exchanged for definitive Notes in registered form.  Any Notes that are exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence are exchangeable for certificated Notes issuable in authorized denominations and registered in such names as the Depository shall direct.  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of definitive Notes in certificated form is registrable in the register maintained by the Company in The City of New York for such purpose, upon surrender of the definitive Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the registrar, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the registrar duly executed by, the holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.  Subject to the foregoing, this Note is not exchangeable, except for a Global Security or Global Securities of this issue of the same principal amount to be registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Company will pay additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") to the beneficial owner of any Note that is a non-United States person in order to ensure that every net payment on such Note will not be less, due to payment of U.S. withholding tax, than the amount then due and payable.  For this purpose, a "net payment" on a Note means a payment by the Company or a paying agent, including payment of principal and interest, after deduction for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge of the United States. These Additional Amounts will constitute additional interest on the Note.
The Company will not be required to pay Additional Amounts, however, in any of the circumstances described in items (1) through (13) below.
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of items (1) through (4) above, "beneficial owner" means a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the holder if the holder is an estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company, corporation or other entity, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust administered by a fiduciary holder.
Except as specifically provided herein, the Company will not be required to make any payment of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by any government or a political subdivision or taxing authority of such government.
As used in this Note, "United States person" means:
 
 
 
 
 
Additionally, "non-United States person" means a person who is not a United States person, and "United States" means the states of the United States of America and the District of Columbia, but excluding its territories and its possessions.
Except as provided below, the Notes may not be redeemed prior to maturity.
Any redemption of the Notes as set forth in clauses (1) or (2) above shall be in whole, and not in part, and will be made at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes Outstanding plus accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption.  Holders shall be given not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior notice by the Trustee of the date fixed for such redemption.
All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.  The Notes are governed by the laws of the State of New York.

If the Holder of this Note has a Survivors Option, as indicated above, to elect repayment of this Note prior to Stated Maturity in the event of the death of any beneficial owner hereof, then, pursuant to exercise of such Survivors Option, the Company will repay this Note (or applicable portion hereof) when properly tendered for repayment by or on behalf of the Person (the Representative) that has authority to act on behalf of the deceased beneficial owner hereof under the laws of the appropriate jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the personal representative, executor, surviving joint tenant or surviving tenant by the entirety of such deceased beneficial owner) at a price equal to the Amortized Face Amount (calculated as set forth below) payable hereunder with respect to such beneficial owner, plus accrued interest thereon to the date of such repayment; , , that the Company may, in its sole discretion, limit to $2,500,000 (or the approximate equivalent thereof in other currencies) the aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series as to which exercises of the Survivors Option will be accepted in any calendar year (the Annual Put Limitation) and, in the event that the Annual Put Limitation is applied, limit to $250,000 (or the approximate equivalent thereof in other currencies) the aggregate principal amount of Notes (or portions thereof) as to which exercises of the Survivors Option will be accepted in such calendar year with respect to any individual deceased beneficial owner of Notes; and , , that the Company will not make any principal payment pursuant to exercise of the Survivors Option in an amount that is less than $5,000 (or the approximate equivalent thereof in other currencies), and, in the event that the foregoing limitations would result in the partial repayment to any individual deceased beneficial owner of Notes, the principal amount owned by such deceased beneficial owner must not be less than $5,000 (or the approximate equivalent thereof in other currencies) as a result of such repayment, which is the minimum authorized denomination of the Notes.

The Amortized Face Amount of this Note on any date shall be the amount equal to (i) the Issue Price set forth on the face hereof plus (ii) that portion of the difference between such Issue Price and the stated principal amount of such Note that has accrued by such date at (x) the Bond Yield to Maturity set forth on the face hereof or (y) if so specified, the Bond Yield to Call set forth on the face hereof (computed in each case in accordance with generally accepted United States bond yield computation principles), , , that in no event shall the Amortized Face Amount of a Note exceed its stated principal amount.  The Bond Yield to Call listed on the face of this Note shall be computed on the basis of the first occurring Optional Redemption Date with respect to such Note and the amount payable on such Optional Redemption Date.  In the event that such Note is not redeemed on such first occurring Optional Redemption Date, the Bond Yield to Call with respect to such Note shall be recomputed on such Optional Redemption Date on the basis of the next occurring Optional Redemption Date and the amount payable on such Optional Redemption Date, and shall continue to be so recomputed on each succeeding Optional Redemption Date until the Note is so redeemed.

This Note (or any portion hereof), if tendered pursuant to a valid exercise of the Survivors Option, will be accepted promptly based on the order in which all such Notes (or any portion thereof) are tendered, unless the acceptance hereof would (i) contravene the Annual Put Limitation or (ii) result in the acceptance during the then current calendar year of an aggregate principal amount of Notes (or portions thereof) exceeding $250,000 (or the approximate equivalent thereof) with respect to any individual deceased beneficial owner.  If, as of the end of any calendar year, the Company has not imposed the Annual Put Limitation or the aggregate principal amount of Notes that have been accepted pursuant to exercise of the Survivors Option during such year has not exceeded the Annual Put Limitation for such year, any exercise of the Survivors Option with respect to this Note (or any portion hereof) not accepted during such calendar year because more than $250,000 (or the approximate equivalent thereof) aggregate principal amount of Notes (or portions thereof) was tendered with respect to the individual deceased beneficial owner hereof will be accepted in the order all such Notes were tendered, to the extent that any such exercise would not trigger the Annual Put Limitation, if any, for such calendar year.  This Note (or portion hereof), if accepted for repayment pursuant to exercise of the Survivors Option, will be repaid on the first Interest Payment Date that occurs twenty or more calendar days after the date of such acceptance.  If this Note (or any portion hereof) is tendered for repayment and is not accepted in any calendar year due to the application of the Annual Put Limitation, then this Note (or any such portion) will be deemed to be tendered in the following calendar year based on the order in which all such Notes (or any portion thereof) were originally tendered, unless this Note (or any such portion hereof) is withdrawn by the Holder.  In the event that this Note (or any portion hereof) tendered for repayment pursuant to valid exercise of the Survivors Option is not accepted, the Paying Agent will deliver a notice to the affected Representative by first-class mail to the broker or other entity that represents the deceased beneficial owner of this Note that states the reasons this Note (or such portion) has not been accepted for repayment.
 
Subject to the foregoing, in order for the Survivors Option to be validly exercised, the Paying Agent must receive (i) a written request for repayment signed by the Representative, and such signature must be guaranteed by a member firm of a registered national securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States, (ii) tender of this Note (or applicable portion hereof), (iii) appropriate evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Paying Agent that (A) the Representative has authority to act on behalf of the applicable deceased beneficial owner hereof, (B) the death of such beneficial owner has occurred and (C) the deceased was a beneficial owner hereof at the time of death, and (iv) if applicable, a properly executed assignment or endorsement, and (v) if the Note is held by a nominee of the deceased beneficial owner, a certificate satisfactory to the Paying Agent from such nominee attesting to the beneficial ownership of such Note.  All questions as to the eligibility or validity of any exercise of the Survivors Option will be determined by the Company, in its sole discretion, which determination will be final and binding.
 
The principal hereof and any premium and interest hereon are payable by the Company in the Specified Currency shown above.  If the Specified Currency shown above is other than U.S. dollars, the Company will arrange to convert all payments in respect hereof into U.S. dollars in the manner described on the reverse hereof.  The Holder hereof may, if so indicated above, elect to receive all payments in respect hereof in the Specified Currency by delivery of a written notice to the Trustee not later than fifteen calendar days prior to the applicable payment date.  Such election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Trustee received not later than fifteen calendar days prior to the applicable payment date.  If the Company determines that the Specified Currency is not available for making payments in respect hereof due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Companys control or is no longer used by the government of the country issuing such currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions or within the international banking community, then the Holder hereof may not so elect to receive payments in the Specified Currency, and any such outstanding election shall be automatically suspended, and payments shall be in U.S. dollars, until the Company determines that the Specified Currency is again available for making such payments.

Payments of interest in U.S. dollars (other than interest payable at Stated Maturity) will be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Register; that, if the Holder hereof is the Holder of U.S. $10,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof in a currency other than U.S. dollars determined as provided on the reverse hereof) or more in aggregate principal amount of Registered Notes of like tenor and term, such U.S. dollar interest payments will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds, but only if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee not less than fifteen calendar days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date.  Simultaneously with any election by the Holder hereof to receive payments in respect hereof in the Specified Currency (if other than U.S. dollars), such Holder shall provide appropriate wire transfer instructions to the Trustee and all such payments will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account maintained by the payee with a bank located outside the United States.  The principal hereof and any premium and interest hereon payable at Stated Maturity will be paid in immediately available funds upon surrender of this Note at the corporate trust office or agency of the Trustee located in the City and State of New York.

As specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, this Note may also have either or both of the following (in each case expressed as a rate per annum on a simple interest basis):  (i) a maximum numerical limitation, or ceiling, on the rate at which interest may accrue during any interest period (Maximum Interest Rate) and/or (ii) a minimum numerical limitation, or floor, on the rate at which interest may accrue during any interest period (Minimum Interest Rate).  In addition to any Maximum Interest Rate that may be specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, the interest rate will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
 
The Company will appoint, and enter into an agreement with, agents (each, a Calculation Agent) to calculate interest rates on this Note.  All determinations of interest rates by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Holder hereof.  Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, Citibank, N.A. shall be the Calculation Agent for this Note.  At the request of the Holder hereof, the Calculation Agent will provide the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the interest rate that will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date.

The interest rate hereon will be reset daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually (such period being the Interest Reset Period specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, and the first day of each Interest Reset Period being an Interest Reset Date).  Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, the Interest Reset Dates will be as follows: (i) if this Note resets daily, each Business Day; (ii) if this Note (unless this Note is a Treasury Rate Note) resets weekly, Wednesday of each week; (iii) if this Note is a Treasury Rate Note that resets weekly, Tuesday of each week (except as provided below under Determination of Treasury Rate); (iv) if this Note resets monthly, the third Wednesday of each month; (v) if this Note is an Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Note that resets monthly, the first calendar day of each month; (vi) if this Note resets quarterly, the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year; (vii) if this Note resets semiannually, the third Wednesday of the two months of each year specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith; and (viii) if this Note resets annually, the third Wednesday of the month of each year specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  If an Interest Reset Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, except that, if the Base Rate specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith is LIBOR or EURIBOR and such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall instead be the immediately preceding Business Day.  If an auction of direct obligations of United States Treasury Bills falls on a day that is an Interest Reset Date for Treasury Rate Notes, the Interest Reset Date shall be the succeeding Business Day.
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, the interest payable hereon on each Interest Payment Date shall equal the accrued interest from and including the Original Issue Date or the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date in respect of which interest has been paid, as the case may be, to but excluding such Interest Payment Date or maturity.
 
If more than one Interest Reset Date occurs during any period for which accrued interest is being calculated, accrued interest shall be calculated by multiplying the principal amount hereof (or if this Note is an Indexed Principal Note, the Face Amount specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith) by an accrued interest factor.  Such accrued interest factor will be computed by adding the interest factors calculated for each day in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated.  The interest factor (expressed as a decimal calculated to seven decimal places without rounding) for each such day will be computed, unless otherwise specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, by dividing the interest rate in effect on such day by 360, if the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is the Commercial Paper Rate, the Federal Funds Rate, the CD Rate, the Prime Rate, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate, LIBOR, or EURIBOR, or by the actual number of days in the year, if the Base Rate specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith is the Treasury Rate.  In all other cases, accrued interest shall be calculated by multiplying the principal amount hereof (or if this Note is an Indexed Principal Note, the Face Amount specified on the face hereof) by the interest rate in effect during the period for which accrued interest is being calculated, and multiplying that product by the quotient obtained by dividing the number of days in the period for which accrued interest is being calculated by 360, if the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is the Commercial Paper Rate, the Federal Funds Rate, the CD Rate, the Prime Rate, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate, LIBOR, or EURIBOR, or by the actual number of days in the year, if the Base Rate specified on the face hereof is the Treasury Rate.  For purposes of making the foregoing calculations, the interest rate in effect on any Interest Reset Date will be the applicable rate as reset on such date.
 
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, all percentages resulting from any calculation of the rate of interest hereof will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100,000 of 1% (.0000001), with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, and all currency amounts used in or resulting from such calculation will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a unit (with .005 of a unit being rounded upward).
 
The pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith will specify the dates on which interest will be payable.  This Note will bear interest from and including the Original Issue Date at the rates specified in this Note until the principal is paid or otherwise made available for payment.  Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, interest will be payable as follows: (i) if this Note resets daily, weekly or monthly (other than Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Notes), interest will be payable on the third Wednesday of each month or on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December of each year, as specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith or; (ii) in the case of Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Notes, interest will be payable on the first calendar day of each March, June, September and December; (iii) if this Note resets quarterly, interest will be payable on the third Wednesday of March, June, September, and December of each year; (iv) if this Note resets semiannually, interest will be payable on the third Wednesday of each of two months of each year specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith; and (v) if this Note resets annually, interest will be payable on the third Wednesday of the month of each year specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, and in each case at Stated Maturity (each such day being an Interest Payment Date).  If an Interest Payment Date would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day, except that, if the Base Rate specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith is LIBOR or EURIBOR and such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Payment Date shall instead be the immediately preceding Business Day; , if with respect to any Note for which Accrue to Pay is not specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, if an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Note would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall not be postponed; , , that any payment required to be made in respect of a Note that does not Accrue to Pay on a date (including the day of Stated Maturity) that is not a Business Day for such Note need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such date, and no additional interest shall accrue as a result of such delayed payment.

Subject to applicable provisions of law and except as specified herein, on each Interest Reset Date the rate of interest shall be the rate determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading below.
 
Determination of CD Rate
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith is the CD Rate, this Note will bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at the interest rate calculated with reference to the CD Rate and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  The CD Rate for each Interest Reset Period will be determined by the Calculation Agent as of the second Business Day prior to the Interest Reset Date for such Interest Reset Period (a CD Rate Determination Date) for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith as published in H.15(519) under the caption CDs (secondary market).  In the event that such rate is not published prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date (as defined above), then the CD Rate for such Interest Reset Period will be the rate on such CD Rate Determination Date for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith as published in the H.15 Daily Update, or other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption CDs (secondary market).  If by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Calculation Date such rate is not yet published in either H.15(519) or H.15 Daily Update, then the CD Rate for such Interest Reset Period will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offered rates as of 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such CD Rate Determination Date of three leading nonbank dealers in negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit of major United States money center banks of the highest credit standing (in the market for negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit) with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith in a denomination of $5,000,000; , that if the dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting offered rates as mentioned in this sentence, the CD Rate for such Interest Reset Period will be the same as the CD Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or, if there was no preceding Interest Reset Period, the Initial Interest Rate).
provided, however
 
Determination of Commercial Paper Rate
 
If the Base Rate shown on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith is the Commercial Paper Rate, this Note will bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at the interest rate calculated with reference to the Commercial Paper Rate and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  The Commercial Paper Rate for each Interest Reset Period will be determined by the Calculation Agent as of the second Business Day prior to the Interest Reset Date for such Interest Reset Period (a Commercial Paper Rate Determination Date) and shall be the Money Market Yield (as defined below) on such Commercial Paper Rate Determination Date of the rate for commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, as such rate shall be published in H.15(519) under the caption Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial.  In the event that such rate is not published prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date (as defined above), then the Commercial Paper Rate for such Interest Reset Period shall be the Money Market Yield on such Commercial Paper Rate Determination Date of the rate for commercial paper of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith as published in the H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption Commercial Paper-Nonfinancial.  If by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Calculation Date such rate is not yet published in either H.15(519) or the H.15 Daily Update, then the Commercial Paper Rate for such Interest Reset Period shall be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of the offered rates as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Commercial Paper Rate Determination Date of three leading dealers of U.S. dollar commercial paper in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial paper of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith placed for an industrial issuer whose bonds are rated AA or the equivalent by a nationally recognized rating agency; that if the dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting offered rates as mentioned in this sentence, the Commercial Paper Rate for such Interest Reset Period will be the same as the Commercial Paper Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or, if there was no preceding Interest Reset Period, the Initial Interest Rate).

Money Market Yield shall be the yield calculated in accordance with the following formula:
 
 
where D refers to the applicable per annum rate for commercial paper quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal and M refers to the actual number of days in the applicable Interest Reset Period specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.
 
Determination of Federal Funds Rate
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith is the Federal Funds Rate, this Note will bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at the interest rate calculated with reference to the Federal Funds Rate and Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  The Federal Funds Rate for each Interest Reset Period will be determined by the Calculation Agent on the second Business Day prior to the Interest Reset Date for such Interest Reset Period (a Federal Funds Rate Determination Date) for Federal Funds as published in H.15(519) under the caption Federal Funds (Effective) and displayed on Moneyline Telerate (or any successor service) on page 120 (or any other page as may replace page 120).  In the event that such rate does not appear on Moneyline Telerate on page 120 or is not published prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date (as defined above), the Federal Funds Rate for such Interest Reset Period shall be the rate on such Federal Funds Rate Determination Date as published in the H.15 Daily Update under the caption Federal Funds (Effective), or other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate.  If by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Calculation Date, such rate is not yet published, then the Federal Funds Rate for such Interest Reset Period shall be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight U.S. dollar federal funds arranged by three leading brokers of U.S. dollar Federal Funds transactions in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on that Federal Funds Rate Determination Date; , that if the brokers so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned above, the Federal Funds Rate for the Interest Reset Period will be the same as the Federal Funds Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period.  If there was no preceding Interest Reset Period, the Federal Funds Rate will be the initial interest rate.
provided, however
 
Determination of LIBOR
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith is LIBOR, this Note will bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at the interest rate calculated with reference to LIBOR and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.  LIBOR for each Interest Reset Period will be determined by the Calculation Agent as follows.
 
On the second London Business Day prior to the Interest Reset Date for such Interest Reset Period (a LIBOR Determination Date), the Calculation Agent for such LIBOR Note will determine the offered rates for deposits in the Specified Currency for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, commencing on such Interest Reset Date, which appear on the Designated LIBOR Page at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such LIBOR Determination Date.  Designated LIBOR Page means either (a) if LIBOR Moneyline Telerate is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, or if neither LIBOR Reuters nor LIBOR Moneyline Telerate is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith as the method for calculating LIBOR, the display designated as page 3750 on the Telerate Service (Telerate) (or such other page as may replace page 3750 on such service or such other service as may be replaced by a successor service for the purpose of displaying the London interbank offered rates of major banks), and LIBOR for such Interest Reset Period will be the relevant offered rate as determined by the Calculation Agent or (b) if LIBOR Reuters is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, Designated LIBOR Page means the display designated as page LIBO on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service and LIBOR will be the arithmetic means of the offered rates, calculated by the Calculation Agent, or the offered rate, if the designated LIBOR page by its terms provides only for a single rate (or such other page as may replace the LIBO page on such service or such other service as may be replaced by a successor service for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates of major banks).  If neither LIBOR Reuters nor LIBOR Telerate is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, LIBOR will be determined as if LIBOR Moneyline Telerate had been specified.

If LIBOR cannot be determined as described above (either because the Designated LIBOR Page is no longer available or because fewer than two offered rates appear on the Designated LIBOR Page on the LIBOR Determination Date), the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Citigroup Funding) will determine LIBOR as follows.  The Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of the four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotations for deposits in the Specified Currency for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, commencing on such Interest Reset Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the LIBOR Determination Date, in a principal amount equal to an amount of at least $1,000,000 or its approximate equivalent thereof in the Specified Currency, that is representative of a single transaction in such market at such time.  If two or more such quotations are provided, LIBOR for such Interest Reset Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations.  If fewer than two such quotations are provided, LIBOR for such Interest Reset Period will be the arithmetic mean of rates quoted by three major banks in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York city time, on the LIBOR Determination Date for loans in the Specified Currency to leading European banks for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, commencing on such Interest Reset Date, in a principal amount equal to an amount of at least $1,000,000 or the approximate equivalent thereof in the Specified Currency that is representative of a single transaction in such market at such time; , that if fewer than three banks selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are quoting rates as mentioned in this sentence.  LIBOR for such Interest Reset Period will be the same as LIBOR for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or, if there was no such Interest Reset Period, LIBOR will be the Initial Interest Rate).
provided, however
 
Determination of Treasury Rate
 
If the Base Rate specified in the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith is the Treasury Rate or Treasury Rate Constant Maturity, this Note will bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at the interest rate calculated with reference to the Treasury Rate and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  Unless Treasury Rate Constant Maturity is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, the Treasury Rate for each Interest Reset Period will be the rate for the auction held on the Treasury Rate Determination Date (as defined below) for such Interest Reset Period of direct obligations of the United States (Treasury Securities) that have the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, as such rate appears on either Moneyline Telerate (or any successor service) on page 56 (or any other page as may replace page 56) or on page 57 (or any other page as may replace page 57) under the caption INVESTMENT RATE.  The following procedures will be followed if the Treasury Rate cannot be determined as described above.  If not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Treasury Rate will be the Bond Equivalent Yield (defined below) of the rate for the applicable treasury securities as published in H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Auction High on that Treasury Rate Determination Date.  In the event that such rate is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, the Treasury Rate will be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the auction rate of the applicable Treasury Securities as announced by the United States Department of the Treasury on that Treasury Rate Determination Date.  In the event that the results of the auction of Treasury Securities is not so announced by the United States Department of the Treasury, or if the auction is not held, then the Treasury Rate will be the Bond Equivalent Yield of the rate on the Treasury Rate Determination Date of the applicable Treasury Securities published in H.15(519) under the caption U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market.  If such rate is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the Treasury Rate will be the rate on the Treasury Rate Determination Date of the applicable Treasury Securities as published in H.15 Daily Update, or another recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying the applicable rate, under the caption U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market on that Treasury Rate Determination Date.  In the event that such rate is not so published by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the Treasury Rate will be the rate on the Treasury Rate Determination Date calculated by the Calculation Agent as the Bond Equivalent Yield of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the Treasury Rate Determination Date, of three primary United States government securities dealers selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Citigroup Funding) for the issue of Treasury Securities with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith; that if the dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting bid rates as mentioned in this sentence, then the Treasury Rate for such Interest Reset Period will be the same as the Treasury Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or, if there was no Interest Reset Period, the Initial Interest Rate).
provided, however,
 
The Treasury Rate Determination Date for each Interest Reset Period will be the day of the week in which the Interest Reset Date for such Interest Reset Period falls on which Treasury Securities would normally be auctioned.  Treasury Securities are normally sold at auction on Monday of each week, unless that day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is normally held on the following Tuesday, except that such auction may be held on the preceding Friday.  If, as the result of a legal holiday, an auction is so held on the preceding Friday, such Friday will be the Treasury Rate Determination Date pertaining to the Interest Reset Period commencing in the next succeeding week.  If an auction date shall fall on any day that would otherwise be an Interest Reset Date for a Note whose Base Rate is the Treasury Rate, then such Interest Reset Date shall instead be the Business Day immediately following such auction date.
 
Bond Equivalent:  Yield will be calculated as follows:
 
 
where D refers to the applicable per annum rate for treasury securities quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal, N refers to 365 or 366, as the case may be, and M refers to the actual number of days in the applicable interest reset period.

If Treasury Rate Constant Maturity is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, the Treasury Rate for each Interest Reset Period will be the rate displayed on the Designated CMT Telerate Rate Page under the caption Treasury Constant Maturities under the column for the Designated CMT Maturity Index in the following manner.  If the Designated CMT Moneyline Telerate Page is 7051, the Treasury Rate will be the rate on the Constant Maturity Treasury Rate Determination Date.  In the event that such rate does not appear on Moneyline Telerate Page 7051, then the Treasury Rate will be the treasury constant maturity rate for the designated CMT maturity index as published in the relevant H.15(519) under the caption Treasury Constant Maturities.  In the event that such rate does not so appear in H.15(519), then the Treasury Rate will be the constant treasury maturity rate on the Constant maturity Treasury Rate Determination Date for the designated CMT maturity index as may then be published by either the Federal Reserve System Board of Governors or the United States Department of the Treasury that the calculation agent determines to be comparable to the rate which would have otherwise been published in H.15(519).  If the Designated CMT Moneyline Telerate Page is 7052, the Treasury Rate will be the weekly or monthly average, as specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, for the week or the month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which the related Constant Maturity Treasury Rate Determination Date occurs.  In the event that such rate does not appear on Moneyline Telerate Page 7052, then the Treasury Rate will be the one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, average of the treasury constant maturity rate for the designated CMT maturity index for the week or month as applicable, preceding the Constant Maturity Treasury Determination Date as published in the relevant H.15(519) under the caption Treasury Constant Maturities.  In the event that such rate does not so appear in H.15(519), then the Treasury Rate will be the one-week or one-month, as specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, average of the constant treasury maturity rate for the designated CMT maturity index as otherwise announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the week or month, as applicable, ended immediately preceding the week or month, as applicable, in which the Constant Maturity Treasury Rate Determination Date falls.
 
The following procedures will be followed if the Treasury Rate cannot be determined as indicated above.  If such information, as applicable, is not so published, then the Calculation Agent will calculate the Treasury Rate on the Constant Maturity Treasury Rate Determination Date as follows which shall be a yield to maturity, based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the Constant Maturity Treasury Rate Determination Date of three leading U.S. government securities dealers in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Citigroup Funding), one of which may be the Agent, from five such dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation, or in the event of equality, one of the highest, and the lowest quotation, or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest, for United States Treasury Securities (Treasury Notes), with an original maturity of approximately the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity of not less than such Designated CMT Maturity Index minus one year and in a principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the securities in that market at that time.
 
If the Calculation Agent is unable to obtain three such Treasury Note quotations, the Treasury Rate on the Constant Maturity Treasury Rate Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent, and shall be a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market offer side prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the Constant Maturity Treasury Rate Determination Date of three leading U.S. government securities dealers in the City of New York, one of which may be the Agent, from five such dealers selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Citigroup Funding) and eliminating the highest quotation, or, in the event of equality, one of the highest, and the lowest quotation, or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest, for Treasury Notes with an original maturity of the number of years that is the next highest to the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, and in an amount that is representative for a single transaction in that market at that time.
 
If three or four, and not five, of such dealers are quoting as described above, then the Treasury Rate will be based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of such quotes will be eliminated.  However, if fewer than three dealers so selected by the Calculation Agent are quoting as mentioned above, the Treasury Rate determined as of the Constant Maturity Treasury Rate Determination Date will be the Treasury Rate in effect on the Constant Maturity Treasury Rate Determination Date.  If two Treasury Notes with an original maturity as described in the third preceding sentence have remaining terms to maturity equally close to the Designated CMT Maturity Index, the Calculation Agent will obtain quotations for the Treasury Note with the shorter remaining term to maturity and will use such quotations to calculate the Treasury Rate as set forth above.
 
Designated CMT Moneyline Telerate Page means the display on the Telerate Service, or any successor service on the page specified in the applicable pricing supplement, or any other page as may replace such page on that service, or any successor service, for the purpose of displaying Treasury Constant Maturities as reported in H.15(519).  If no such page is specified in the applicable pricing supplement, the Designated CMT Telerate Page shall be 7052, for the most recent week.
 
Designated CMT Maturity Index means the original period to maturity of the U.S. Treasury securities, either one, two, three, five, seven, ten, twenty or thirty years, specified in the applicable pricing supplement with respect to which the Treasury Rate will be calculated.  If no such maturity is specified in the applicable pricing supplement, the Designated CMT Maturity Index shall be two years.
 
The Constant Maturity Treasury Rate Determination Date shall be the second Business Day prior to the Interest Reset Date for the applicable Interest Reset Period.
 
Determination of Prime Rate
 
Prime Rate Notes will bear interest at the interest rates (calculated with reference to the Prime Rate and the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any) specified in the Prime Rate Notes and in the applicable pricing supplement.
 
 
6
 
 
The Prime Rate for each Interest Reset Period will be determined by the Calculation Agent for such Prime Rate Note as of the second Business Day prior to the Interest Reset Date for such Interest Reset Period (a Prime Rate Determination Date) and shall be the rate made available and subsequently published on such date in H.15(519) under the caption Bank Prime Loan.  In the event that such rate is not published prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date (as defined above) pertaining to such Prime Rate Determination Date, then the Prime Rate for such Interest Reset Period shall be the rate published in the H.15 Daily Update under the caption Bank Prime Loan.  In the event that such rate has not been published prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Calculation Date, then the Prime Rate will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen USPRIME1 Page (as defined below) as such banks prime rate or base lending rate on the Prime Rate Determination Date.  If fewer than four such rates appear on the Reuters Screen USPRIME1 Page for the Prime Rate Determination Date, the rate shall be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by 360 as of the close of business on the Prime Rate Determination Date by three major banks in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with Citigroup Funding).  However, if the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in the previous sentence, the Prime Rate will be the Prime Rate for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or, if there was no such Interest Reset Period, the Initial Interest Rate).
 
Reuters Screen USPRIME1 Page means the display designated as page USPRIME1 on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service, (or such other page as may replace the USPRIME1 page on that service for the purpose of displaying prime rates or base lending rates of major United States banks).
 
Determination of Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate
 
Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Notes will bear interest at the interest rates (calculated by reference to the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate and the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any) specified in the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Notes and in the applicable pricing supplement.
 
The Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate, for each Interest Reset Period will be determined by the Calculation Agent for such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Note as of the last working day of the month immediately prior to such Interest Reset Date for such Interest Reset Period on which the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (the FHLB of San Francisco) publishes the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Index (as defined below) (the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Determination Date), and shall be the rate equal to the monthly weighted average cost of funds for the calendar month preceding such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Determination Date as set forth under the caption Eleventh District on Moneyline Telerate (or any successor service) on page 7058 (which page shall include any successor page (as determined by the Calculation Agent)) as of 11:00 a.m., San Francisco time, on such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Determination Date.  If such rate does not appear on Telerate page 7058 on any related Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Determination Date, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Determination Date shall be the monthly weighted average cost of funds paid by member institutions of the Eleventh Federal Home Loan Bank District that was most recently announced (the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Index) by the FHLB of San Francisco as such cost of funds for the calendar month preceding the date of such announcement.  If the FHLB of San Francisco fails to announce such rate on or prior to the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Determination Date for the calendar month immediately preceding such date, then the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate for such date will be the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate in effect on the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Determination Date.  If there was no preceding Interest Reset Period, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate will be the Initial Interest Rate.
 
The Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Index will be the monthly weighted average cost of funds paid by member institutions of the Eleventh Federal Home Loan Bank District that the FHLB of San Francisco most recently announced as the cost of funds for the calendar month preceding the date of such announcement.
 
Determination of EURIBOR
 
If the Base Rate specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith is EURIBOR, this Note will bear interest for each Interest Reset Period at the interest rate calculated with reference to EURIBOR and the Spread or Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  EURIBOR for each Interest Reset Period will be determined by the Calculation Agent as follows.
 
On the second TARGET Business Day prior to the Interest Reset Date for such Interest Reset Period (a EURIBOR Determination Date), the Calculation Agent for such EURIBOR Note will determine the offered rates for deposits in Euros as sponsored, calculated and published jointly by the European Banking Federation and ACIThe Financial Market Association, or any company established by the joint sponsors for purposes of compiling and publishing those rates, for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, commencing on such Interest Reset Date, which appears on the Designated EURIBOR Page as of 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such EURIBOR Determination Date.  Designated EURIBOR Page means the display designated as page 248 on Telerate (or any successor service or such other page as may replace page 248 on such service), and EURIBOR for such Interest Reset Period will be the relevant offered rates as determined by the Calculation Agent.
 
If EURIBOR cannot be determined as described above the Calculation Agent will determine EURIBOR as follows.  The Calculation Agent will request the principal Euro-zone (as defined below) office of each of four major banks in the Euro-zone interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent to provide the Calculation Agent with their respective offered quotations for deposits in Euros for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, commencing on such Interest Reset Date, to prime banks in the Euro-zone interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on the EURIBOR Determination Date, in a principal amount equal to an amount of at least 1,000,000 or its approximate equivalent thereof in Euros that is representative of a single transaction in such market at such time.  If two or more such quotations are provided, EURIBOR for such Interest Reset Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations.  If less than two such quotations are provided, EURIBOR for such Interest Reset Period will be the arithmetic mean of rates quoted by four major banks in the Euro-zone selected by the Calculation Agent for such EURIBOR Note at approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on the EURIBOR Determination Date for loans in Euros to leading European banks for the period of the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, commencing on such Interest Reset Date, in a principal amount equal to an amount of at least 1,000,000 or the approximate equivalent thereof in Euros that is representative of a single transaction in such market at such time; , that if the banks so selected a aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are not quoting rates as mentioned in this sentence, EURIBOR for such Interest Reset Period will be same as EURIBOR for the immediately preceding Interest Reset Period (or, if there was no such Interest Reset Period, the EURIBOR Rate will be the Initial Interest Rate).
provided, however

Inverse Floating Rate Notes
 
If this Note is designated as an Inverse Floating Rate Note on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, the Inverse Floating Rate shall be equal to (i) in the case of the period, if any, commencing on the Original Issue Date (or such other date which may be specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith as the date on which this Note shall begin to accrue interest), up to the first Interest Reset Date, the Initial Fixed Interest Rate specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, and (ii) in the case of each period commencing on an Interest Reset Date, the Reset Fixed Reference Rate specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith minus the interest rate determined by reference to the Base Rate specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, as adjusted by the Spread and/or Spread Multiplier, if any, as determined in accordance with the provisions hereof; that the interest rate thereon will not be less than zero.
provided, however,
 
Floating Rate / Fixed Rate Notes
 
If this Note is designated as a Floating Rate / Fixed Rate Note, this Note will be a Floating Rate note for a specified portion of its term and a Fixed Rate Note for the remainder of its term, in which event the interest rate on this Note will be determined as provided herein as if it were a Floating Rate Note and a Fixed Rate Note hereunder for each such respective period, all as described herein and in the applicable pricing supplement.
 
Subsequent Interest Periods
 
If so specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, the Spread, Spread Multiplier or method of calculation of the Interest Rate on this Note may be reset by the Company on the date or dates specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith (each an Optional Reset Date).  The Company may reset the Spread, Spread Multiplier or method of calculation of the Interest Rate Interest Rate by notifying the Trustee for this Note at least 45 but not more than 60 days prior to each Optional Reset Date.  Not later than 40 days prior to each Optional Reset Date, the Trustee will mail to the Holder of this Note a notice (the Reset Notice), first class, postage prepaid, indicating whether the Company has elected to reset the Spread, Spread Multiplier or method of calculation of the Interest Rate, and if so, (i) such new Spread, Spread Multiplier or method of calculation of the Interest Rate and (ii) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the period from such Optional Reset Date to the next Optional Reset Date, or, if there is no such next Optional Reset Date, to the Stated Maturity of this Note (each such period, a Subsequent Interest Period), including the date or dates on which or the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the Subsequent Interest Period.  Upon the transmittal by the Trustee of a Reset Notice to the Holder of a Note, such new Spread, Spread Multiplier or method of calculation of the Interest Rate shall take effect automatically.  Except as modified by the Reset Notice and as described below, such Note will have the same terms as prior to the transmittal of such Reset Notice.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days prior to the Optional Reset Date, the Company may, at its option, revoke the Spread or Spread Multiplier provided for in the Reset Notice and establish a higher Spread or Spread Multiplier for the Subsequent Interest Period by causing the Trustee to mail notice of such higher Spread or Spread Multiplier, first class, postage prepaid, to the Holder of this Note.  Such notice shall be irrevocable.  All Registered Notes with respect to which the Spread or Spread Multiplier is reset on an Optional Reset Date will bear such higher Spread or Spread Multiplier.
 
The Holder of this Note will have the option to elect repayment of the Note by the Company on each Optional Reset Date at a price equal to the principal amount hereof, plus interest accrued to such Optional Reset Date.  In order to obtain repayment on an Optional Reset Date, the Holder must follow the procedures set forth below for optional repayment, except that the period for delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days prior to such Optional Reset Date, and except that if the Holder has tendered this Note for repayment pursuant to a Reset Notice, the Holder may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke such tender for repayment until the close of business on the tenth day before the Optional Reset Date.
 
Indexed Notes
 
If this Note is an Indexed Principal Note, then certain or all interest payments, in the case of an Indexed Rate Note, and/or the principal amount payable at Stated Maturity or earlier redemption or retirement, in the case of an Indexed Principal Note, is determined by reference to the amount designated on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith as the Face Amount of this Note and by reference to the Index as described on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  If this Note is an Indexed Principal Note, the amount of any interest payment will be determined by reference to the Face Amount described on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  If this Note is an Indexed Principal Note, the principal amount payable at Stated Maturity or any earlier redemption or repayment of this Note may be different from the Face Amount.  If a third party is appointed to calculate or announce the Index for a particular Indexed Note and the third party either suspends the calculation or announcement of such Index or changes the basis upon which such Index is calculated in a manner that is inconsistent with the applicable pricing supplement, then the Company will select another third party to calculate or announce the Index.  The agent or another affiliate of the Company may be either the original or successor third party selected by the Company.
 
 
8
 
 
If for any reason such Index cannot be calculated on the same basis and subject to the same conditions and controls as applied to the original third party, then the indexed interest payments, if any, or any indexed principal amount of this Note shall be calculated in the manner set forth in the applicable pricing supplement.  Any determination of such third party shall in the absence of manifest error be binding on all parties.
 
Specified Currency
 
If the Specified Currency is other than U.S. dollars, the amount of any U.S. dollar payment to be made in respect hereof will be determined by the Company or its agent based on the specified currency/U.S. dollar exchange rate prevailing at 11:00 a.m., London time, on the second Exchange Rate Business Day prior to the applicable payment date.  In the event that such exchange rate bid quotation is not so available, the Exchange Rate Agent after consultation with the Companys control.   All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Holders of such Registered Notes by deductions from such payments.  If no such bid quotations are available, then such payments will be made in the Specified Currency, unless the Specified Currency is unavailable due to the imposition of exchange controls or to other circumstances beyond the Companys control, in which case payment will be made as described in the next paragraph.
 
Payments in Currencies other than the Specified Currency
 
Except as set forth below, if any payment in respect hereof is required to be made in a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars and such currency is unavailable due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Companys control or is no longer used by the government of the country issuing such currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then such payment shall be made in U.S. dollars until such currency is again available or so used.  The amount so payable in such foreign currency shall be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate for such currency or as otherwise indicated on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  Any payment made under such circumstances in U.S. dollars will not constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.
 
In the event of an official redenomination of the Specified Currency of this Note (other than as a result of European Monetary Union, but including, without limitation, an official redenomination of any such Specified Currency that is a composite currency), the obligations of the Company with respect to payments on this Note shall, in all cases, be deemed immediately following such redenomination to provide for the payment of that amount of redenominated currency representing the amount of such obligations immediately before such redenomination.  This Note does not provide for any adjustment to any amount payable under this Note as a result of (i) any change in the value of the Specified Currency hereof relative to any other currency due solely to fluctuations in exchange rates or (ii) any redenomination of any component currency of any composite currency (unless such composite currency is itself officially redenominated).
 
Dual Currency Notes
 
If this Note is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith as a Dual Currency Note, the Company may have a one time option of making all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on all Dual Currency Notes issued on the same day and having the same terms (a Tranche), which payments would otherwise be made in the Specified Currency of such Notes, in an optional currency (the Optional Payment Currency).  Such option will be exercisable in whole but not in part on an Option Election Date, which will be any one of the dates specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.
 
If the Company makes such an election, the amount payable in the Optional Payment Currency shall be determined using the Designated Exchange Rate specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  If such election is made, notice of such election shall be mailed in accordance with the terms of the applicable Tranche of Dual Currency Notes within two Business Days of the Option Election Date and shall state (i) the first date, whether an Interest Payment Date and/or Stated Maturity, in which scheduled payments in the Optional Payment Currency  will be made and (ii) the Designated Exchange Rate.  Any such notice by the Company, once given, may not be withdrawn.  The equivalent value in the Specified Currency of payments made after such an election may be less, at the then current exchange rate, than if the Company had made such payment in the Specified Currency.
 
Renewable Notes

On the Interest Payment Date occurring in the sixth month (unless a different interval (the Special Election Interval) is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith) prior to the Initial Maturity Date of this Note (the Initial Renewal Date) and on the Interest Payment Date occurring in each sixth month (or in the last month of each Special Election Interval) after such Initial Renewal Date (each, together with the Initial Renewal Date, a Renewal Date), the term of this Note may be extended to the Interest Payment Date occurring in the twelfth month (or, if a Special Election Interval is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, the last month in a period equal to twice the Special Election Interval) after such Renewal Date, if the Holder of this Note elects to extend the term of this Note or any portion thereof as described below.  If the Holder does not elect to extend the term of any portion of the principal amount of this Note during the specified period prior to any Renewal Date, such portion will become due and payable on the Interest Payment Date occurring in the sixth month (or the last month in the Special Election Interval) after such Renewal Date (the New Maturity Date).
 
 
9
 
 
The Holder may elect to renew the term of this Note, or if so specified, any portion thereof, by delivering a notice to such effect to the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) at the corporate trust office of the Trustee or agency of the Trustee in the City of New York not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to such Renewal Date, unless another period is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  Such election will be irrevocable and will be binding upon each subsequent Holder of this Note.  An election to renew the term of this Note may be exercised with respect to less than the entire principal amount of this Note only if so specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith and then only in such principal amount, or any integral multiple in excess thereof, as is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.

Extension of Stated Maturity

The Company may exercise such option by notifying the Trustee for this Note at least 45 but not more than 60 days prior to the original Stated Maturity of this Note.

Upon the Trustees mailing of the Extension Notice, the Stated Maturity of this Note shall be extended automatically and, except as modified by the Extension Notice and as described in the next paragraph, this Note will have the same terms as prior to the mailing of such Notice.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days prior to the original Stated Maturity of this Note, the Company may, at its option, revoke the Spread or Spread Multiplier provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher Spread or Spread Multiplier for the Extension Period by causing the Trustee to mail notice of such higher Spread or Spread Multiplier, first class, postage prepaid, to the Holder of this Note.  Such notice shall be irrevocable.  All Registered Notes with respect to which the Stated Maturity is extended will bear such higher Spread or Spread Multiplier for the Extension Period, whether or not tendered for repayment.
 
If the Company extends the Stated Maturity of this Note, the Holder will have the option to elect repayment of this Note by the Company on the original Stated Maturity at a price equal to the principal amount hereof, plus interest accrued to such date.  In order to obtain repayment on such original Stated Maturity once the Company has extended the Stated Maturity hereof, the Holder must follow the procedures set forth below for optional repayment, except that the period for delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days before the original Stated Maturity, and except that if the Holder has tendered this Note for repayment pursuant to an Extension Notice, the Holder may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke such tender for repayment until the close of business on the tenth calendar day before the original Stated Maturity.

Unless otherwise stated on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, the Trustee shall mail to the Holder a notice of such redemption first class, postage prepaid, at least 30 days prior to the date of redemption.

The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on each Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which, unless otherwise specified on the face of this Note or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith (and other than interest payable at Stated Maturity), shall be the date (whether or not a Business Day) fifteen calendar days immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date and, in the case of interest payable at Stated Maturity, shall be the Stated Maturity of this Note.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Note is issued between a Regular Record Date and the related Interest Payment Date, the interest so payable for the period from the Original Issue Date to such Interest Payment Date shall be paid on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date to the Registered Holder hereof on the related Regular Record Date.  Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Registered Holder hereof on such Regular Record Date, and may be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes not less than ten days prior to such Special Record Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Registered Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.

If the Holder of this Note has a Survivors Option, as indicated above, to elect repayment of this Note prior to Stated Maturity in the event of the death of any beneficial owner hereof, then, pursuant to exercise of such Survivors Option, the Company will repay this Note (or applicable portion hereof) when properly tendered for repayment by or on behalf of the Person (the Representative) that has authority to act on behalf of the deceased beneficial owner hereof under the laws of the appropriate jurisdiction (including, without limitation, the personal representative, executor, surviving joint tenant or surviving tenant by the entirety of such deceased beneficial owner) at a price equal to the Amortized Face Amount (calculated as set forth below) payable hereunder with respect to such beneficial owner, plus accrued interest thereon to the date of such repayment; , , that the Company may, in its sole discretion, limit to $2,500,000 (or the approximate equivalent thereof in other currencies) the aggregate principal amount of Notes of this series as to which exercises of the Survivors Option will be accepted in any calendar year (the Annual Put Limitation) and, in the event that the Annual Put Limitation is applied, limit to $250,000 (or the approximate equivalent thereof in other currencies) the aggregate principal amount of Notes (or portions thereof) as to which exercises of the Survivors Option will be accepted in such calendar year with respect to any individual deceased beneficial owner of Notes; and , , that the Company will not make any principal payment pursuant to exercise of the Survivors Option in an amount that is less than $5,000 (or the approximate equivalent thereof in other currencies), and, in the event that the foregoing limitations would result in the partial repayment to any individual deceased beneficial owner of Notes, the principal amount owned by such deceased beneficial owner must not be less than $5,000 (or the approximate equivalent thereof in other currencies) as a result of such repayment, which is the minimum authorized denomination of the Notes.  This Note, or any portion hereof, if tendered pursuant to an exercise of the Survivors Option, may be withdrawn by a written request of the Holder hereof received by the Paying Agent prior to its repayment.

The Amortized Face Amount of this Note on any date shall be the amount equal to (i) the Issue Price set forth on the face hereof plus (ii) that portion of the difference between such Issue Price and the stated principal amount of such Note that has accrued by such date at (x) the Bond Yield to Maturity set forth on the face hereof or (y) if so specified, the Bond Yield to Call set forth on the face hereof (computed in each case in accordance with generally accepted United States bond yield computation principles), , , that in no event shall the Amortized Face Amount of a Note exceed its stated principal amount.  The Bond Yield to Call listed on the face of this Note shall be computed on the basis of the first occurring Optional Redemption Date with respect to such Note and the amount payable on such Optional Redemption Date.  In the event that such Note is not redeemed on such first occurring Optional Redemption Date, the Bond Yield to Call with respect to such Note shall be recomputed on such Optional Redemption Date on the basis of the next occurring Optional Redemption Date and the amount payable on such Optional Redemption Date, and shall continue to be so recomputed on each succeeding Optional Redemption Date until the Note is so redeemed.

This Note (or any portion hereof), if tendered pursuant to a valid exercise of the Survivors Option, will be accepted promptly based on the order in which all such Notes (or any portion thereof) are tendered, unless the acceptance hereof would (i) contravene the Annual Put Limitation or (ii) result in the acceptance during the then current calendar year of an aggregate principal amount of Notes (or portions thereof) exceeding $250,000 (or the approximate equivalent thereof) with respect to any individual deceased beneficial owner.  If, as of the end of any calendar year, the Company has not imposed the Annual Put Limitation or the aggregate principal amount of Notes that have been accepted pursuant to exercise of the Survivors Option during such year has not exceeded the Annual Put Limitation for such year, any exercise of the Survivors Option with respect to this Note (or any portion hereof) not accepted during such calendar year because more than $250,000 (or the approximate equivalent thereof) aggregate principal amount of Notes (or portions thereof) was tendered with respect to the individual deceased beneficial owner hereof will be accepted in the order all such Notes were tendered, to the extent that any such exercise would not trigger the Annual Put Limitation, if any, for such calendar year.  This Note (or portion hereof), if accepted for repayment pursuant to exercise of the Survivors Option, will be repaid on the first Interest Payment Date that occurs twenty or more calendar days after the date of such acceptance.  If this Note (or any portion hereof) is tendered for repayment and is not accepted in any calendar year due to the application of the Annual Put Limitation, then this Note (or any such portion) will be deemed to be tendered in the following calendar year based on the order in which all such Notes (or any portion thereof) were originally tendered, unless this Note (or any such portion hereof) is withdrawn by the Holder.  In the event that this Note (or any portion hereof) tendered for repayment pursuant to valid exercise of the Survivors Option is not accepted, the Paying Agent will deliver a notice to the affected Representative by first-class mail to the broker or other entity that represents the deceased beneficial owner of this Note that states the reasons this Note (or such portion) has not been accepted for repayment.  If this Note is an Amortizing Note as shown on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, a portion or all the principal amount of the Note is payable prior to Stated Maturity in accordance with a schedule, by application of a formula, or by reference to an Index (as described above).
 
Subject to the foregoing, in order for the Survivors Option to be validly exercised, the Paying Agent must receive (i) a written request for repayment signed by the Representative, and such signature must be guaranteed by a member firm of a registered national securities exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States, (ii) tender of this Note (or applicable portion hereof), (iii) appropriate evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Paying Agent that (A) the Representative has authority to act on behalf of the applicable deceased beneficial owner hereof, (B) the death of such beneficial owner has occurred and (C) the deceased was a beneficial owner hereof at the time of death, and (iv) if applicable, a properly executed assignment or endorsement, and (v) if the Note is held by a nominee of the deceased beneficial owner, a certificate satisfactory to the Paying Agent from such nominee attesting to the beneficial ownership of such Note.  All questions as to the eligibility or validity of any exercise of the Survivors Option will be determined by the Company, in its sole discretion, which determination will be final and binding.

The principal hereof and any premium and interest hereon are payable by the Company in the Specified Currency shown above.  If the Specified Currency shown above is other than U.S. dollars, the Company will arrange to convert all payments in respect hereof into U.S. dollars in the manner described on the reverse hereof.  The Holder hereof may, if so indicated above, elect to receive all payments in respect hereof in the Specified Currency by delivery of a written notice to the Trustee not later than fifteen calendar days prior to the applicable payment date.  Such election will remain in effect until revoked by written notice to the Trustee received not later than fifteen calendar days prior to the applicable payment date.  If the Company determines that the Specified Currency is not available for making payments in respect hereof due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Companys control or is no longer used by the government of the country issuing such currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions or within the international banking community, then the Holder hereof may not so elect to receive payments in the Specified Currency, and any such outstanding election shall be automatically suspended, and payments shall be in U.S. dollars, until the Company determines that the Specified Currency is again available for making such payments.
 
Payments of interest in U.S. dollars (other than interest payable at Stated Maturity) will be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear on the Register; that, if the Holder hereof is the Holder of U.S. $10,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof in a currency other than U.S. dollars determined as provided on the reverse hereof) or more in aggregate principal amount of Registered Notes of like tenor and term, such U.S. dollar interest payments will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds, but only if appropriate wire transfer instructions have been received in writing by the Trustee not less than fifteen calendar days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date.  Simultaneously with any election by the Holder hereof to receive payments in respect hereof in the Specified Currency (if other than U.S. dollars), such Holder shall provide appropriate wire transfer instructions to the Trustee and all such payments will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account maintained by the payee with a bank located outside the United States.  The principal hereof and any premium and interest hereon payable at Stated Maturity will be paid in immediately available funds upon surrender of this Note at the corporate trust office or agency of the Trustee located in the City and State of New York.

General
 
This Note is one of a series of duly authorized debt securities of the Company (the Debt Securities) issued or to be issued in one or more series under an indenture, dated as of June 1, 2005, as such indenture may be amended from time to time (the Indenture), among the Company,  the Guarantor, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as trustee (the Trustee, which term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to which indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Holders of the Debt Securities and of the terms upon which the Debt Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.  The payments due on the Debt Securities are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantor.
This debt is guaranteed under the FDIC TLGP and is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.  The details of the FDIC guarantee are provided in the FDICs regulations, 12 CFR Part 370, and at the FDICs website,
www.fdic.gov/tlgp
.  The expiration date of the FDICs guarantee is the earlier of the maturity date of this debt or June 30, 2012.
 
  The U.S. dollar equivalent of the public offering price or purchase price of Notes denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars will be determined by the Company or its agent, as exchange rate agent for the Notes (the Exchange Rate Agent) on the basis of the noon buying rate in New York City for cable transfers in foreign currencies as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the Market Exchange Rate) for such currencies on the applicable issue dates.
 
The Notes are in registered form without coupons.  Unless otherwise specified in the applicable pricing supplement, the authorized denominations of Registered Notes denominated in U.S. dollars will be U.S.$1,000 and any larger amount that is an integral multiple of U.S.$1,000.  The authorized denominations of Registered Notes denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars will be the approximate equivalents thereof in the Specified Currency.
 
Each Registered Note will be issued initially as a Book-Entry Note, and will not be exchangeable for Certificated Notes, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture or specified in the applicable pricing supplement.
 
Fixed Rate Notes
 
This Note will bear interest from its Original Issue Date, or from the last Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, at the Interest Rate stated on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith until the principal amount hereof is paid or made available for payment, except as otherwise described below under Subsequent Interest Periods and Extension of Stated Maturity, and except that if so specified in the attached pricing supplement, the rate of interest payable may be subject to adjustment as specified therein.
 
Unless otherwise set forth herein or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, interest on this Note will be payable semiannually in arrears on the Interest Payment Dates set forth above and at Stated Maturity. If an Interest Payment Date with respect to any Note would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall not be postponed; , that any payment required to be made in respect of such Note on a date (including the day of Stated Maturity) that is not a Business Day for such Note need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such date, and no additional interest shall accrue as a result of such delayed payment.  However, if with respect to any Note for which Accrue to Pay is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, any Interest Payment Date with respect to such Fixed Rate Note would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day.
provided,
however
 
Each payment of interest in respect of an Interest Payment Date shall include interest accrued through the day before such Interest Payment Date.  Unless otherwise specified herein, interest on this Note will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months (30 over 360) or, in the case of an incomplete month, the number of days elapsed.
 
Subsequent Interest Periods
 
If so specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, the Interest Rate on this Note may be reset by the Company on the date or dates specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith (each an Optional Reset Date).  The Company may reset the Interest Rate by notifying the Trustee for this Note at least 45 but not more than 60 days prior to each Optional Reset Date.  Not later than 40 days prior to each Optional Reset Date, the Trustee will mail to the Holder of this Note a notice (the Reset Notice), first class, postage prepaid, indicating whether the Company has elected to reset the Interest Rate, and if so, (i) such new Interest Rate and (ii) the provisions, if any, for redemption during the period from such Optional Reset Date to the next Optional Reset Date, or, if there is no such next Optional Reset Date, to the Stated Maturity of this Note (each such period, a Subsequent Interest Period), including the date or dates on which or the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the Subsequent Interest Period.  Upon the transmittal by the Trustee of a Reset Notice to the Holder of a Note, such new Interest Rate shall take effect automatically.  Except as modified by the Reset Notice and as described below, such Note will have the same terms as prior to the transmittal of such Reset Notice.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days prior to the Optional Reset Date, the Company may, at its option, revoke the Interest Rate provided for in the Reset Notice and establish a higher Interest Rate for the Subsequent Interest Period by causing the Trustee to mail notice of such higher Interest Rate, first class, postage prepaid, to the Holder of this Note.  Such notice shall be irrevocable.  All Registered Notes with respect to which the Interest Rate is reset on an Optional Reset Date will bear such higher Interest Rate.

The Holder of this Note will have the option to elect repayment of the Note by the Company on each Optional Reset Date at a price equal to the principal amount hereof, plus interest accrued to such Optional Reset Date.  In order to obtain repayment on an Optional Reset Date, the Holder must follow the procedures set forth below for optional repayment, except that the period for delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days prior to such Optional Reset Date, and except that if the Holder has tendered this Note for repayment pursuant to a Reset Notice, the Holder may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke such tender for repayment until the close of business on the tenth day before the Optional Reset Date.
 
Indexed Notes
 
If this Note is an Indexed Principal Note, then the principal amount payable at Stated Maturity or earlier redemption or retirement is determined by reference to the amount designated on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith as the Face Amount of this Note and by reference to the Index as described on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  If this Note is an Indexed Principal Note, the principal amount payable at Stated Maturity or any earlier redemption or repayment of this Note may be different from the Face Amount.  If a third party is appointed to calculate or announce the Index for a particular Indexed Note and the third party either suspends the calculation or announcement of such Index or changes the basis upon which such Index is calculated in a manner that is inconsistent with the applicable pricing supplement, then the Company will select another third party to calculate or announce the Index.  The agent or another affiliate of the Company may be either the original or successor third party selected by the Company.
 
If for any reason such Index cannot be calculated on the same basis and subject to the same conditions and controls as applied to the original third party, then the indexed principal amount of this Note shall be calculated in the manner set forth in the applicable pricing supplement.  Any determination of such third party shall in the absence of manifest error be binding on all parties.
 
Specified Currency
 
If the Specified Currency is other than U.S. dollars, the amount of any U.S. dollar payment to be made in respect hereof will be determined by the Company or its agent based on the highest firm bid quotation expressed in U.S. dollars received by the Company or its agent at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date (or, if no such rate is quoted on such date, the last date on which such rate was quoted) from three (or, if three are not available, then two) recognized foreign exchange dealers in The City of New York selected by the Exchange Rate Agent (one or more of which may be an agent involved in the distribution of the Notes (an Agent) and another of which may be the Exchange Rate Agent) for the purchase by the quoting dealer, for settlement on such payment date, of the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable on such payment date in respect of all Registered Notes denominated in such Specified Currency.  All currency exchange costs will be borne by the Holders of such Registered Notes by deductions from such payments.  If no such bid quotations are available, then such payments will be made in the Specified Currency, unless the Specified Currency is unavailable due to the imposition of exchange controls or to other circumstances beyond the Companys control, in which case payment will be made as described in the next paragraph.
 
Payments in Currencies other than the Specified Currency
 
Except as set forth below, if any payment in respect hereof is required to be made in a specified currency other than U.S. dollars and such currency is unavailable due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Companys control or is no longer used by the government of the country issuing such currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community, then such payment shall be made in U.S. dollars until such currency is again available or so used.  The amount so payable in such foreign currency shall be converted into U.S. dollars on the basis of the most recently available Market Exchange Rate for such currency or as otherwise indicated on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  Any payment made under such circumstances in U.S. dollars will not constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.
 
In the event of an official redenomination of the Specified Currency of this Note (other than as a result of European Monetary Union, but including, without limitation, an official redenomination of any such Specified Currency that is a composite currency), the obligations of the Company with respect to payments on this Note shall, in all cases, be deemed immediately following such redenomination to provide for the payment of that amount of redenominated currency representing the amount of such obligations immediately before such redenomination.  This Note does not provide for any adjustment to any amount payable under this Note as a result of (i) any change in the value of the Specified Currency hereof relative to any other currency due solely to fluctuations in exchange rates or (ii) any redenomination of any component currency of any composite currency (unless such composite currency is itself officially redenominated).
 
Dual Currency Notes
 
If this Note is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith as a Dual Currency Note, the Company may have a one time option of making all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on all Dual Currency Notes issued on the same day and having the same terms (a Tranche), which payments would otherwise be made in the Specified Currency of such Notes, in an optional currency (the Optional Payment Currency).  Such option will be exercisable in whole but not in part on an Option Election Date, which will be any one of the dates specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.
 
If the Company makes such an election, the amount payable in the Optional Payment Currency shall be determined using the Designated Exchange Rate specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  If such election is made, notice of such election shall be mailed in accordance with the terms of the applicable Tranche of Dual Currency Notes within two Business Days of the Option Election Date and shall state (i) the first date, whether an Interest Payment Date and/or Stated Maturity, in which scheduled payments in the Optional Payment Currency will be made and (ii) the Designated Exchange Rate.  Any such notice by the Company, once given, may not be withdrawn.  The equivalent value in the Specified Currency of payments made after such an election may be less, at the then current exchange rate, than if the Company had made such payment in the Specified Currency.

Renewable Notes
 
If this Note is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith as a Renewable Note, this Note will mature on an Interest Payment Date occurring in or prior to the twelfth month following the Original Issue Date of this Note (the Initial Maturity Date) unless the term of all or any portion of this Note is renewed in accordance with the following procedures:
 
On the Interest Payment Date occurring in the sixth month (unless a different interval (the Special Election Interval) is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith) prior to the Initial Maturity Date of this Note (the Initial Renewal Date) and on the Interest Payment Date occurring in each sixth month (or in the last month of each Special Election Interval) after such Initial Renewal Date (each, together with the Initial Renewal Date, a Renewal Date), the term of this Note may be extended to the Interest Payment Date occurring in the twelfth month (or, if a Special Election Interval is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, the last month in a period equal to twice the Special Election Interval) after such Renewal Date, if the Holder of this Note elects to extend the term of this Note or any portion thereof as described below.  If the Holder does not elect to extend the term of any portion of the principal amount of this Note during the specified period prior to any Renewal Date, such portion will become due and payable on the Interest Payment Date occurring in the sixth month (or the last month in the Special Election Interval) after such Renewal Date (the New Maturity Date).
 
The Holder may elect to renew the term of this Note, or if so specified, any portion thereof, by delivering a notice to such effect to the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) at the corporate trust office of the Trustee or agency of the Trustee in the City of New York not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to such Renewal Date, unless another period is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  Such election will be irrevocable and will be binding upon each subsequent Holder of this Note.  An election to renew the term of this Note may be exercised with respect to less than the entire principal amount of this Note only if so specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith and then only in such principal amount, or any integral multiple in excess thereof, as is specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term of this Note may not be extended beyond the Stated Maturity specified for this Note on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.
 
If the Holder does not elect to renew the term, this Note must be presented to the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) and, as soon as practicable following receipt of such Note the Trustee (or any duly appointed paying agent) shall issue in exchange therefor in the name of such Holder (i) a Note, in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of such exchanged Note for which no election to renew the term thereof was exercised, with terms identical to those specified on such exchanged Note (except that such Note shall have a fixed, nonrenewable Stated Maturity on the New Maturity Date) and (ii) if an election to renew is made with respect to less than the full principal amount of such Holders Note, the Trustee, or any duly appointed paying agent, shall issue in exchange for such Note in the name of such Holder a replacement Renewable Note, in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of such exchanged Note for which the election to renew was made, with terms otherwise identical to the exchanged Note.
 
Extension of Stated Maturity
 
If so specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, the Stated Maturity of this Note may be extended at the option of the Company for one or more periods of whole years specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith (each an Extension Period) from one to five years up to but not beyond the date (the Final Maturity) set forth on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith.  The Company may exercise such option by notifying the Trustee for this Note at least 45 but not more than 60 days prior to the original Stated Maturity of this Note.  If the Company exercises such option, the Trustee will mail to the Holder of this Note not later than 40 days prior to the original Stated Maturity a notice (the Extension Notice), first class, postage prepaid, indicating (i) the election of the Company to extend the Stated Maturity, (ii) the new Stated Maturity, (iii) the Interest Rate applicable to the Extension Period, and (iv) the provisions, if any, for redemption during such Extension Period including the date or dates on which, or the period or periods during which, and the price or prices at which, such redemption may occur during the Extension Period.  Upon the Trustees mailing of the Extension Notice, the Stated Maturity of this Note shall be extended automatically and, except as modified by the Extension Notice and as described in the next paragraph, this Note will have the same terms as prior to the mailing of such Notice.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days prior to the original Stated Maturity of this Note, the Company may, at its option, revoke the Interest Rate provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher Interest Rate for the Extension Period by causing the Trustee to mail notice of such higher Interest Rate, first class, postage prepaid, to the Holder of this Note.  Such notice shall be irrevocable.  All Registered Notes with respect to which the Stated Maturity is extended will bear such higher Interest Rate for the Extension Period, whether or not tendered for repayment.
 
If the Company extends the Stated Maturity of this Note, the Holder will have the option to elect repayment of this Note by the Company on the original Stated Maturity at a price equal to the principal amount hereof, plus interest accrued to such date.  In order to obtain repayment on such original Stated Maturity once the Company has extended the Stated Maturity hereof, the Holder must follow the procedures set forth below for optional repayment, except that the period for delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days before the original Stated Maturity, and except that if the Holder has tendered this Note for repayment pursuant to an Extension Notice, the Holder may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke such tender for repayment until the close of business on the tenth calendar day before the original Stated Maturity.

If so specified on the face hereof or in the pricing supplement attached hereto or delivered herewith, the Company may, at its option, redeem this Note in whole or in part, on the date or dates (each an Optional Redemption Date) specified herein, at the price (the Redemption Price) (together with accrued interest to such Optional Redemption Date) specified herein.
