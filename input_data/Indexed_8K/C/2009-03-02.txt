Filed by Citigroup Inc. pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act of 1933 and deemed filed pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Subject Company: Citigroup Inc. Commission File No. 1-9924
     On February 27, 2009, Citi announced that it will offer to exchange shares of its common stock for approximately $15 billion aggregate liquidation value of publicly held preferred stock and trust preferred securities at exchange factors to be announced. Additional information about the terms of the exchange offers is provided below.
Publicly Held Preferred Stock
     Citi will offer to acquire any and all issued and outstanding depositary shares representing shares of its Series F, Series AA, Series T and Series E preferred stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of the exchange offers and assuming 100% participation by holders of depositary shares representing these series of preferred stock, Citi will accept for purchase approximately $14.92 billion aggregate liquidation value of preferred stock, which would leave approximately $80 million in aggregate liquidation value available to accept trust preferred securities for purchase as described below.
     The following table shows, with respect to each series of preferred stock, the aggregate liquidation value outstanding, the liquidation value per depositary share, the applicable exchange factor and the number of shares of common stock that Citi will offer per depositary share representing preferred stock.

     Citi will offer to acquire an aggregate liquidation value of publicly held E-TPS and TPS of approximately $15 billion, less the aggregate liquidation value of all depositary shares representing preferred stock accepted for purchase in the exchange offers. We refer to this amount as the "Remaining Amount." The Remaining Amount will be equal to at least $80 million and will be higher in the event that less than all of the $14.92 billion aggregate liquidation value of issued and outstanding preferred stock is tendered and accepted in the exchange offers.

     Because the aggregate liquidation value of E-TPS and TPS that Citi will accept for purchase in the exchange offers is limited to the Remaining Amount, Citi has assigned each series of E-TPS and TPS an Acceptance Priority Level (with Acceptance Priority Level 1 being the highest). Subject to the terms and conditions of the exchange offers, Citi will apply the Remaining Amount to accept for purchase all E-TPS or TPS with a higher Acceptance Priority Level before accepting any E-TPS or TPS with a lower Acceptance Priority Level. If Citi is unable to purchase all E-TPS or TPS with the same Acceptance Priority Level without exceeding the Remaining Amount, then Citi will purchase only a pro rata portion of the E-TPS or TPSwith that Acceptance Priority Level. Citi will not purchase any E-TPS or TPSfrom a series with an Acceptance Priority Level that is lower than a series that has been subject to prorationing.

Additional Terms of the Exchange Offers
The exchange offers have not yet commenced. Consummation of each exchange offer will be subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by us, at or prior to the expiration of the exchange offers, of a number of conditions. We will describe additional terms of the exchange offers, including the conditions, in a prospectus and related exchange offer materials that we will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In no event will Citi accept for purchase any depositary shares representing preferred stock or trust preferred securities to the extent that doing so would require Citi to issue a number of shares of common stock in excess of its currently authorized share capital. Citi will continue to pay distributions on the E-TPS and TPS at the current rates. Citi is offering to acquire a limited number of E-TPS and TPS, and as a result, holders of E-TPS and TPS may be subject to prorationing as described above. In connection with the transactions, Citi will suspend dividends on its preferred stock. Citi is offering to acquire any and all depositary shares representing preferred stock, and holders of these shares will not be subject to prorationing.
