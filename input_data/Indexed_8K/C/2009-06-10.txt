Item 8.01  Other Events.
 
On June 10, 2009, Citigroup Inc. announced that it finalized a definitive agreement with the U.S. Government and will now launch its previously announced exchange offers for publicly held convertible and non-convertible preferred and trust preferred securities.  The public exchange offers are currently scheduled to expire on or about July 24, 2009, unless extended.  Citigroup also announced that the record date for holders of preferred securities entitled to give written consent for certain amendments to the terms of Citigroups preferred securities described in a proxy statement for that consent action is currently scheduled to be June 16, 2009 which Citi will confirm via press release.
 
A copy of the press release announcing the events described above, among other items, is being filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
 
Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Item 3.03.  Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.
 
On June 9, 2009, the board of directors of Citigroup adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan (the ).  The purpose of the Plan is to protect Citigroups ability to utilize certain tax assets, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits (the ), to offset future income.  Citigroups use of the Tax Benefits in the future could be significantly limited if it experiences an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  as defined under U.S. income tax laws
Plan
Tax Benefits
In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in Citigroups ownership by 5-percent shareholders (
) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.
 
The Plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that Citigroup will experience an ownership change by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a 5-percent shareholder and (ii) discouraging any existing 5-percent shareholder from acquiring more than a specified number of additional shares of Citigroup stock.  There is no guarantee, however, that the Plan will prevent Citigroup from experiencing an ownership change.
 
  
A corporation that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on certain of its pre-ownership change tax assets equal to the value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate (subject to certain adjustments), provided that the annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year.  The limitation arising from an ownership change on Citigroups ability to utilize the Tax Benefits depends on the value of Citigroups stock at the time of the ownership change.
If Citigroups Tax Benefits are subject to limitation because it experiences an ownership change, depending on the value of Citigroups stock at the time of the ownership change, Citigroups tangible common equity might be reduced.
 
After giving careful consideration to this issue, in light of the previously announced exchange offers, Citigroups board of directors has concluded that the Plan is in the best interests of Citigroup and its stockholders.
 
In connection with the adoption of the Plan, on June 9, 2009, Citigroups board of directors declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (a ) for each outstanding (i) share of Citigroups common stock and (ii) one-millionth of a share of the Series M preferred stock (as described below, the ).  The dividend will be payable to holders of record of Citigroups common stock and Interim Securities on June 22, 2009 (the ).

Record Date
 
Each Right will initially represent the right to purchase, for $20.00 (the ), one one-millionth of a share of Series R Cumulative Participating Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the ).  The terms and conditions of the Rights are set forth in the Plan.
Purchase Price
Series R Preferred Stock
 
The Rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of (i) the close of business on the 10th business day after the date (the ) of the announcement that a person has become an Acquiring Person (as defined below) and (ii) the close of business on the 10th business day (or such later day as may be designated by Citigroups board of directors before any person has become an Acquiring Person (as defined below)) after the date of the commencement of a tender or exchange offer by any person which could, if consummated, result in such person

becoming an Acquiring Person (as defined below).  The date that the Rights become exercisable is referred to as the .
Distribution Date
 
After any person has become an Acquiring Person (as defined below) (other than Rights treated as beneficially owned under certain U.S. tax rules by the Acquiring Person), each Right will generally entitle the holder to purchase for the Purchase Price a number of shares of Series R Preferred Stock having a market value of twice the Purchase Price.
 
An  means, in general, any person or group that has become a 5-percent shareholder of Citigroup, other than (A) Citigroup or any subsidiary or employee benefit plan or compensation arrangement of Citigroup; (B) the United States government; (C) certain existing 5-percent shareholders (including certain persons who are 5-percent shareholders following the previously announced exchange offers with Citigroup) so long as each such shareholder does not acquire more than a specified number of additional shares of Citigroups stock; (D) certain other grandfathered persons (as described in the Plan), so long as such grandfathered persons satisfy the applicable requirements in the Plan; (E) any person or group that Citigroups board of directors determines, in its sole discretion, has inadvertently become a 5-percent shareholder (or inadvertently failed to continue to qualify as a grandfathered person), so long as such person or group promptly divests sufficient shares so as to no longer own 5% of Citigroups stock; (F) any person or group that has become a 5-percent shareholder (or failed to qualify as a grandfathered person) solely as a result of certain in-kind distributions, so long as such person or group satisfies the applicable requirements set forth in the Plan; (G) any person or group that Citigroups board of directors determines, in its sole discretion, has not jeopardized or endangered Citigroups utilization of its Tax Benefits, so long as each such shareholder does not acquire any additional shares of Citigroups stock and so long as our board of directors does not, in its sole discretion, make a contrary determination; and (H) any person that acquires at least a majority of Citigroups common stock (and, for so long as the Interim Securities remain outstanding, at least a majority of the Interim Securities) in connection with an offer to acquire 100% of Citigroups common stock then outstanding (and, for so long as the Interim Securities remain outstanding, 100% of the Interim Securities).
Acquiring Person
 
At any time after any person has become an Acquiring Person (but before any person becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of Citigroups common stock), Citigroups board of directors may generally exchange all or part of the Rights (other than Rights beneficially owned under certain U.S. tax rules by an Acquiring Person) for shares of Series R Preferred Stock at an exchange ratio of one one-millionth of a share of Series R Preferred Stock per Right.
 
The issuance of the Rights is not taxable to holders of Citigroups common stock or Interim Securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
Upon conversion of the Interim Securities into common stock, any Rights associated with such Interim Securities will be extinguished and the common stock issued upon such conversion will be issued with Rights attached thereto.
 
Citigroups board of directors may redeem all of the Rights at a price of $0.00001 per Right at any time before a Distribution Date.
 
Prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced by the certificates for (or current ownership statements issued with respect to uncertificated shares in lieu of certificates for) and will be transferred with, Citigroups common stock and Interim Securities, and the registered holders of Citigroups common stock and Interim Securities will be deemed to be the registered holders of the Rights.  After the Distribution Date, the rights agent will mail separate certificates evidencing the Rights to each record holder of Citigroups common stock and Interim Securities as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, and thereafter the Rights will be transferable separately from Citigroups common stock and Interim Securities.  The Rights will expire on June 10, 2012, unless earlier exchanged or redeemed.
 
At any time prior to the Distribution Date, the Plan may be amended in any respect.  At any time after the occurrence of a Distribution Date, the Plan may be amended in any respect that does not adversely affect Rights holders (other than any Acquiring Person).
 
 
A Rights holder has no rights as a stockholder of Citigroup, including the right to vote and to receive dividends.
 
The Plan includes antidilution provisions designed to maintain the effectiveness of the Rights.
 
The above summary of the Plan is qualified by the full text of the Plan being filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The Company shall (i) file, as soon as practicable following the earliest date after a Stock Acquisition Date and determination of the consideration to be delivered by the Company upon exercise of the Rights in accordance with Section 9(a)(ii), or as soon as is required by law following a Distribution Date, as the case may be, a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the securities issuable upon exercise of the Rights, (ii) to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing and (iii) cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Securities Act) until the earlier of (A) the date as of which the Rights are no longer exercisable for such securities and (B) the Expiration Date. The Company shall also take such action as may be appropriate to ensure compliance with the securities or blue sky laws of the various states in connection with the exercisability of the Rights. The Company may temporarily suspend, for a period of time not to exceed 90 days after the date set forth in Section 8(c)(i), the exercisability of the Rights in order to prepare and file such registration statement and permit it to become effective. Upon any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement when the suspension is no longer in effect.

Prior to any such issuance or delivery of any Right Certificates or any certificates for Preferred Stock, any such transfer tax or other governmental charge shall have been paid by the holder of such Right Certificate or it shall have been established to the Companys satisfaction that no such tax or other governmental charge is due.

If an event occurs which requires an adjustment under both this Section 9(a)(i) and Section 9(a)(ii), the adjustment provided for in this Section 9(a)(i) shall be made prior to, and in addition to, any adjustment required pursuant to Section 9(a)(ii).

The closing price for each day shall be the last sale price, regular way, at the close of the regular session of trading or, if no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system at the close of the regular session of trading with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the shares of Common Stock are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, on the principal national securities exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed or admitted to trading or, if the shares of Common Stock are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the- counter market, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System or such other system then in use or, if on any such date the shares of Common Stock are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Common Stock selected by the Board (in each case prices which are not identified as having been reported late to such system). If on any such date, no market maker is making a market in the Common Stock or the Common Stock is not publicly held or not so listed or traded, the current market value of such shares on such date shall be as determined in good faith by the Board (or, if at the time of such determination there is an Acquiring Person, by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Board) which determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be conclusive for all purposes.

For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the current market price per share of Preferred Stock shall be determined in the same manner as set forth above for the Common Stock in Section 9(d)(i) (other than the last sentence thereof). If the current market price per share of Preferred Stock cannot be determined in such manner, the current market price per share of Preferred Stock shall be conclusively deemed to be an amount equal to 1,000,000 (as such number may be appropriately adjusted for such events as stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock occurring after the date of this Rights Plan) multiplied by the current market price per share of Common Stock (as determined pursuant to Section 9(d)(i)). For all purposes of this Rights Plan, the current market price of one one- millionth of a share of Preferred Stock shall be equal to the current market price of one share of Preferred Stock divided by 1,000,000.
(iii)
 
For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the value of any securities or assets other than Common Stock or Preferred Stock shall be the fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, or, if at the time of such determination there is an Acquiring Person, by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Board, which determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be conclusive for all purposes.
 
(e)
 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Rights Plan to the contrary, no adjustment of any item described in Section 9(a)(i) (., the Purchase Price, the Redemption Price, the number of shares of Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights, etc) shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the relevant item; that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 9(e) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 9 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share of Common Stock or other share or one ten-billionth of a share of Preferred Stock, as the case may be.

After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company shall file notice thereof with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock, and, subsequent to a Distribution Date, mail a notice thereof to the registered holders of the Right Certificates. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 19, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
SECTION 20 (a) At any time prior to a Distribution Date, the Board may, at its option, redeem all but not less than all of the then outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $0.00001 per Right, as such amount may be appropriately adjusted pursuant to Section 9(a)(i) (such redemption price being hereinafter referred to as the ). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish. The Redemption Price shall be payable, at the option of the Company, in cash, shares of Common Stock, or such other form of consideration as the Board shall determine.

The Company shall promptly thereafter give notice of such redemption to the Rights Agent and the holders of the Rights in the manner set forth in Section 23;

SECTION 21 (a) At any time on or after a Stock Acquisition Date, with respect to all or any part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become void pursuant to Section 6(e)), the Board may, at its option, exchange for each Right one one-millionth of a share of Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 9(a)(i) (such exchange ratio being hereinafter referred to as the ). The exchange of the Rights by the Board may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish.

Immediately upon the effectiveness of the action of the Board to exchange any Rights pursuant to Section 21(a) (or at such later time as the Board may establish) and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights will terminate and thereafter the only right of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of fractional shares of Preferred Stock equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The Company shall promptly thereafter give notice of such exchange to the Rights Agent and the holders of the Rights to be exchanged in the manner set forth in Section 23; that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of Rights for fractional shares of Preferred Stock will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to Section 6(e)) held by each holder of Rights.

(c)
 
In lieu of exchanging all or any part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights for fractional shares of Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 21(a), the Board may, at its option, exchange any such Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become void pursuant to Section 6(e)) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right, as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 9(a)(i).

Exhibit 99.1
Filed by Citigroup Inc. pursuant to Rule 425
under the Securities Act of 1933 and
deemed filed pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Subject Company: Citigroup Inc.
Registration No. 333-158100
For Immediate Release
Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C)
June 10, 2009
Citi has finalized with the U.S. Governmentlaunch its exchange offers for publicly held convertible and non-convertible preferred and trust preferred securities. Under the agreement, the Government will exchange a portion of its preferred securities with an aggregate liquidation value of up to $25 billion for interim securities and warrants and its remaining preferred securities for trust preferred securities.  The public exchange offers are currently scheduled to expire on July 24, 2009, subject to extension by Citi.
New York 
a definitive agreement
and will now
Assuming full participation of holders of convertible and non-convertible public preferred and trust preferred securities in the exchange offers, Citi will convert into common shares approximately $58 billion in aggregate liquidation value of preferred stock and trust preferred securities.  The exchange offers are subject to a number of conditions, including the closing of the previously announced exchange offers with private holders of its preferred securities and the matching exchange offer with the Government and related regulatory approval of those transactions.
Vikram Pandit, CEO of Citi, said, "Following completion of the exchange offers, Citi will be among the best capitalized banks in the world.  Our employees have worked tirelessly to get Citi fit by taking control of our balance sheet and expenses.  Their hard work has helped position the company to withstand a challenging market environment and to return to sustained profitability.  We have the right strategy, the right structure and the right people.  I'm confident that we will continue to make progress and that the strength of our franchise will be evident as the economy improves."
"A great deal has been accomplished over the past year, said Richard Parsons, Citi Chairman of the Board.  "Citi's management team, led by CEO Vikram Pandit, has clarified the Company's strategy by announcing the Citicorp/Citi Holdings plan, and has taken the tough decisions to downsize the Company and cut expenses significantly.

Once this exchange offer is completed, we will also have addressed Citi's financial stability.  We have confidence in our management and the future of our institution."
After completion of the exchange offers, our Tangible Common Equity could increase by up to approximately $61 billion, and our Tier 1 Common may increase by up to approximately $64 billion from their respective amounts at March 31, 2009, said Ned Kelly, Citi CFO. These new levels place us squarely among the ranks of the worlds best capitalized banks.
 
(Tangible Common Equity and Tier 1 Common are non-GAAP financial measures.  A reconciliation of Tangible Common Equity and Tier 1 Common to total stockholders' equity and common stockholders' equity, respectively, is included below.)
 
In connection with the public exchange offers, Citi will file two definitive proxy statements with the SEC, updating preliminary versions filed on June 3, 2009.  One definitive proxy statement proposes, among other things, to amend Citis Charter and certain certificates of designation to modify the rights of holders of publicly held convertible and non-convertible preferred stock.  The record date for holders of publicly held convertible and non-convertible preferred securities entitled to vote on these matters is currently scheduled to be June 16, 2009 which Citi will confirm via a press release.
The other definitive proxy statement proposes, among other things, to amend Citis Charter to increase the number of authorized shares of its common stock and authorize the Board of Directors the option to execute a reverse stock split of its common stock.  The record date for holders of common stock entitled to vote on these matters will be the settlement date for the public exchange offers, which is scheduled to occur shortly after the expiration date.
Today Citi also announced that its Board of Directors has unanimously adopted a tax benefits preservation plan to protect the companys ability to utilize certain tax assets. According to U.S. federal income tax rules, Citis use of certain tax assets could be substantially limited if the Company experiences an ownership change.  In general, an ownership change would occur if there were a cumulative change in Citis ownership by 5-percent shareholders (as defined under U.S. federal income tax laws) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.  The tax benefits preservation plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that Citi experiences such an ownership change by discouraging any person or group from becoming a 5-percent shareholder and dissuading existing 5-percent shareholders from acquiring more than a minimal number of additional shares of Citis stock.  
Details of the tax benefits preservation plan will be filed today with the SEC and will be accessible via the EDGAR database on the SECs website at
www.sec.gov
.
As part of the tax benefits preservation plan, on June 9, 2009, Citis Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right (a Right) for each outstanding share of common stock and interim securities, which are the securities issued in connection with the exchange offers with the U.S. Government and private holders of Citis preferred stock.  The dividend will be payable to holders of record as of
 
2
 
the close of business on June 22, 2009 and shares of Citi common stock and interim securities issued after such date will also receive Rights.
The Rights will be triggered in any instance of a person becoming an Acquiring Person (as defined in the plan).  If triggered, each Right entitles the holder (other than the person or group that caused the Rights to become exercisable) to purchase the preferred stock (an underlying common stock equivalent) at a 50 percent discount to the then market price of the common stock; and the Rights owned by the acquiring person or group become void.  Alternatively, if the rights are triggered, Citis Board of Directors may decide instead to exchange all or part of the exercised Rights (other than those held by the acquiring person) for shares of common stock.
The tax benefits preservation plan will be in effect for only 36 months, in contrast to traditional rights plans that generally last 10 years. Additionally, the plan does not apply to U.S. Government acquisitions of Citi common stock.

In connection with the exchange offers, Citi has filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 that contains a prospectus and related exchange offer materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on June 3, 2009. This registration statement has not yet become effective. Citi will mail the prospectus to the holders of its series of convertible and non-convertible public preferred stock and TruPs and E-TruPs that may be eligible to participate in the exchange offer. Holders of these series of preferred stock, TruPs and E-TruPs are urged to read the prospectus and related exchange offer materials because they contain important information.
In connection with the solicitation of proxies for the proposed amendments to its certificate of incorporation, Citi has filed preliminary proxy statements with the SEC.  The definitive proxy statements and accompanying proxy cards will be mailed to stockholders of Citi. Investors and security holders of Citi are urged to read the proxy statements and other relevant materials as they become available because they will contain important information.
Citi and its directors and executive officers and other persons may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect of the proposed amendments to its certificate of incorporation and the certificates of designations of its public preferred stock. Information regarding Citis directors and executive officers is available in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, which was filed with the SEC on February 27, 2009, and its definitive proxy statement for its 2009 annual meeting of shareholders, which was filed with the SEC on March 19, 2009. The proxy statements contain additional information regarding the participants in the proxy solicitations and a description of their direct and indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise.
 
As stated above, after completion of the exchange offers, Citis TCE could increase by up to approximately $61 billion and its Tier 1 Common could increase by up to approximately $64 billion, in each case, as of March 31, 2009, on a pro forma basis.TCE, as defined by Citi, represents common equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights) net of the related deferred tax liabilities. Other companies may calculate TCE in a manner different from Citi. Citis TCE was $30.9 billion at March 31, 2009. A reconciliation of Citis total stockholders equity to TCE is included in the table below:

Tier 1 Common is defined as Tier 1 Capital less non-common elements including qualified perpetual preferred stock, qualifying minority interest in subsidiaries and qualifying trust preferred securities.
