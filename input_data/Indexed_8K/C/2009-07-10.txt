Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
(1)
        
The Company adopted FSP EITF 03-6-1 on January 1,  2009.  All prior periods have been restated to conform to the current presentation.  The Diluted EPS calculation for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2008, and the 2009 first quarter, utilizes Basic shares and Income available to common shareholders (Basic) due to the negative Income available to common shareholders. Using actual Diluted shares and Income available to common shareholders (Diluted) would result in anti-dilution.
(2)
        
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, preferred stock dividends (subject to declaration) will vary quarter-to-quarter due to Series E being declared on a semi-annual basis compared to a quarterly basis for all other series.
(3)
     
The first quarter of 2009 Income available to common shareholders includes a reduction of $1.285 billion related to the conversion price reset (triggered on January 23, 2009) pursuant to Citigroup's prior agreement with the purchasers of the $12.5 billion convertible preferred stock issued in a private offering in January 2008, the conversion price was reset from $31.62 per share to $26.35 per share. The reset will result in Citigroup's issuing approximately 79 million additional common shares when the preferred stock is converted. There is no impact to net income, total stockholders' equity or capital ratios due to the reset. However, the reset resulted in a reclassification from Retained earnings to Additional paid-in capital of $1.285 billion and a reduction in Income available to common shareholders of $1.285 billion.  Income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 includes a reduction of $ 37 million and $53 million, respectively, related to the preferred stock Series H quarterly discount accretion.

Includes allowance for credit losses for letters of credit and unfunded lending commitments of $1,100 million for the first and second quarters of 2007, $1,150 million for the third quarter of 2007 and $1,250 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, respectively.

Managed-basis (Managed) presentations detail certain non-GAAP financial measures.  Managed presentations (applicable only to North American credit card operations, as securitizations are not done in any other regions) include results from both the on-balance sheet loans and off- balance sheet loans, and exclude the impact of card securitization activity. Managed presentations assume that securitized loans have not been sold and present the results of the securitized loans in the same manner as the Citigroup's owned loans. Citigroup believes that Managed presentations are useful to investors because they are widely used by analysts and investors within the credit card industry. Managed presentations are commonly used by other companies within the financial services industry.
See pages 26 - 28 for a further discussion of the Managed presentations and a reconciliation of these measures to their most comparable GAAP measure.

Exhibit 99.4
 
 
For Immediate Release
Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C)
July 10, 2009
 
New York  On January 16, 2009, Citi announced its realignment into three new reporting segments: Citicorp, Citi Holdings and Corporate/Other.   Today, Citi is providing a historical Quarterly Financial Data Supplement for these segments.  The supplement includes quarterly results from the first quarter of 2007 through the first quarter of 2009, and yearly results from 2006 through 2008, to reflect the new reporting structure and assist the historical analysis process.
 
Citi implemented this realignment in February, and though there is no legal separation of the three segments, financial reporting will reflect the new structure going forward, beginning with the second quarter of 2009.
 
"The creation of Citicorp and Citi Holdings reflects our strategy to refocus the company on its greatest strength: our global institutional and consumer banking businesses, while exiting non-core businesses and reducing risk assets," said Vikram Pandit, Chief Executive Officer.  "Citicorp is an extraordinary franchise with the largest global presence of any financial services firm in the world.  Our focus is to grow Citicorp while managing our long term exit from the non-core businesses and assets held in Citi Holdings."
 
As previously announced:
 
                 
Citicorp consists of Regional Consumer Banking in North America, EMEA, Asia and Latin America, and the Institutional Clients Group (Securities and Banking, including the Private Bank, and Transaction Services).
 
                 
Citi Holdings consists of Brokerage and Asset Management, Local Consumer Lending, and a Special Asset Pool. At the end of the first quarter 2009, Citi had $235.8 billion of on-balance sheet assets covered by the loss-sharing agreement with the U.S. Government. Local Consumer Lending holds approximately 75% of these assets (mostly Consumer assets), and the Special Asset Pool holds the remainder (mostly former Securities and Banking assets).
 
                 
Corporate/Other and Discontinued Operations will be reported at the Citigroup level, and will not be reflected in Citicorp and Citi Holdings results.
 
The reformatted Quarterly Financial Data Supplement, as well as historical Press Release Disclosed Items, Securities and Banking Revenue Marks, and a Citigroup Segment Chart, each mapped to the new structure, are now posted on Citi's Investor Relations website at
http://www.citigroup.com/citigroup/fin.
 
Citi will announce second quarter results on Friday, July 17, 2009 at 8 a.m. (New York time).
 
Citi, the leading global financial services company, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 140 countries. Through its two operating units, Citicorp and Citi Holdings, Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, and wealth management. Additional information may be found at www.citigroup.com or www.citi.com.
