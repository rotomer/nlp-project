Exhibit 99.1
 
 
For Immediate Release
Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C)
October 15, 2009
 
 
New York  Citigroup today reported net income for the third quarter 2009 of $101 million, and a $0.27 loss per share, based on an average 12.1 billion shares outstanding(2).  Third quarter revenues were $20.4 billion.  Results included $8.0 billion in net credit losses and an $802 million net loan loss reserve build.
 
During the third quarter, Citigroup completed its previously announced exchange offers.  This resulted in an $851 million after-tax gain, but also in a $3.1 billion reduction in income available to common shareholders, resulting in an incremental net $0.18 loss per share.  The reported loss per share also reflected preferred stock dividends, which did not affect net income but reduced income available to common shareholders by $288 million or $0.02 per share.
 
"This was an important quarter for us. The completion of the exchange offers and the significant actions taken during the last few quarters have created a strong foundation. With strong capital, strong liquidity and a strong franchise, we are looking forward.  We continue to execute steadily against our plan, and sustainable profitability remains our primary goal in the near term.  While consumer credit trends are improving in international markets, the U.S. consumer credit environment remains challenging," said Vikram Pandit, Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup.
 
"Our Tier 1 and Tier 1 Common ratios ended the quarter at 12.7% and 9.1% respectively.  Our client franchise continues to perform well. Customer deposits grew $28 billion during the quarter, Securities and Banking has produced record year-to-date revenues and Global Transaction Services has produced record year-to-date net income and both had a solid third quarter.  We are also seeing increased customer activity in our Global Consumer business."
 
"Looking forward, we will continue to focus on sustainable profitability and growth, repaying TARP and helping support America's economic recovery."
 
KEY ITEMS
 
                 
Citigroup revenues were $20.4 billion.  Managed revenues(3) were $23.1 billion.  Excluding a $1.4 billion gain from the impact of the exchange offers and the $11.1 billion Smith Barney gain on sale, managed revenues were stable versus the prior quarter.
 
                 
Citicorp revenues of $13.0 billion (managed revenues
3
 of $14.8 billion) included a negative $1.7 billion credit value adjustment ("CVA").
 
                 
Citi Holdings revenues of $6.7 billion (managed revenues
3
 of $7.6 billion) included $1.5 billion of positive net revenue marks.
                 
Net credit losses remained elevated at $8.0 billion, but were down from $8.4 billion in the prior quarter.  Managed net credit losses(3) were $11.0 billion, down from $11.5 billion in the prior quarter.
 
                 
Net loan loss reserve build was $802 million, down from $3.9 billion in the prior quarter.
 
                 
The allowance for loan losses increased to $36.4 billion, or 5.9% of total loans.
 
                 
Completion of exchange offers resulted in an additional $64 billion of Tier 1 Common and $60 billion of Tangible Common Equity(4).  As a result, Tangible Common Equity and Tier 1 Common ratios improved during the third quarter to 10.3% and 9.1%, respectively.  Tier 1 Capital remained stable at 12.7%. Tangible book value per share was $4.47.
 
                 
Deposits were $833 billion, up $28 billion from the second quarter of 2009. Deposit growth was strong in both Transaction Services and Regional Consumer Banking.
 
                 
Citi Holdings assets declined $32 billion to $617 billion during the quarter and are now down $281 billion from peak levels in the first quarter 2008.
 
                 
Enhanced liquidity position  ended the quarter with $244 billion in cash and due from banks, and deposits with banks, up from $209 billion at June 30, 2009.
 
                 
Completed sales of Nikko Cordial Securities and Nikko Asset Management on October 1, 2009, which will result in a further approximate $25 billion decline in Citi Holdings assets in the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
                 
Completed more than 24,000 mortgage loan modifications during the quarter.  In addition, at the end of the quarter, Citigroup had more than 63,000 loans in the trial modification period under the Home Affordable Modification Program ("HAMP").
 
 
 
Citigroup
revenueswere $20.4 billion, down from $30.0 billion in the prior quarter, which included an $11.1 billion gain from the Smith Barney transaction.  Managed revenues(
3) were $23.1 billion, down from $33.1 billion in the prior quarter.  Third quarter managed revenues included a $1.4 billion gain from the extinguishment of debt associated with the exchange offers.  Excluding the impact of this gain and the Smith Barney transaction from the prior quarter, managed revenues were down 1% sequentially.
 
Citicorp
revenues were $13.0 billion, down from $15.0 billion in the prior quarter.  Managed revenues(
3) were $14.8 billion, down from $16.6 billion in the prior quarter.  Excluding the impact of negative net revenue marks in each quarter, managed revenues were down approximately 6% sequentially due primarily to declines in Securities and Banking revenue.
 
                 
Regional Consumer Banking revenues were $5.7 billion, up 1% sequentially.  Managed revenues(3) of $7.5 billion were up 3% from the prior quarter. Asia, EMEA and Latin America all showed sequential increases in revenues.  North America revenues were flat with the prior quarter, as increasing credit losses flowing through the securitization trusts offset increases in net interest revenue due to higher deposit and loan volumes.  North America managed revenues(3) were up 4% sequentially.  Average deposits were up 3% sequentially to $275 billion, primarily driven by growth in North America and Asia.  Investment AUMs increased 7% sequentially to $115 billion on improving markets and stronger investment sales, particularly in Asia.  Average retail banking loans increased 4% sequentially to $77.7 billion, while Citi-branded cards average managed loans
3
 were up about 2% to $112.7 billion.
 
                 
Securities and Banking revenues declined to $4.9 billion from $6.9 billion in the prior quarter, reflecting CVA of negative $1.7 billion.  Excluding the impact of CVA, revenues were $6.6 billion which compares to an equivalent of $7.7 billion in the prior quarter.  Investment banking revenues were $1.2 billion, flat with the prior quarter as an uptick in advisory revenue offset modest declines in debt underwriting.  The continued improvement in market liquidity, traditional seasonal factors and lower volatility in many markets resulted in
diminished trading opportunities during the quarter, particularly in equity derivatives, credit, and securitized products.  Equity markets revenues were $446 million ($1.3 billion excluding CVA) versus $1.1 billion ($1.8 billion excluding CVA) in the prior quarter.  Fixed income markets revenues were $3.9 billion ($4.7 billion excluding CVA) versus $5.6 billion ($5.7 billion excluding CVA) in the prior quarter.
 
                 
Transaction Services revenues were $2.5 billion, in line with the prior quarter, as higher fees and higher deposits offset spread compression.   Average deposits and other customer liability balances increased $26 billion during the quarter to $314 billion.  End of period assets under custody increased by $0.7 trillion to $11.8 trillion.
 
Citi Holdings
revenues were $6.7 billion versus $15.8 billion in the prior quarter, which included the $11.1 billion gain from the Smith Barney transaction.  Managed revenues(
3) were $7.6 billion during the quarter, up 25% from the prior quarter excluding the Smith Barney gain, driven primarily by positive net revenue marks within the Special Asset Pool (see Appendix A).  The current quarter's results include a $320 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Citigroup's managed futures business to the Smith Barney JV.
 
Corporate/Other
revenues were $671 million versus a $741 million loss in the prior quarter, primarily due to the $1.4 billion gain on debt extinguishment associated with the exchange offers.
 
CREDIT
 
Citigroup's credit costs of $9.1 billion included net credit losses of $8.0 billion, a $0.8 billion net loan loss reserve build and $0.3 billion of policyholder benefits and claims.  Total credit costs were down 28% sequentially from $12.7 billion in the prior quarter.
 
                
Net credit losses declined $386 million or 5% sequentially.  Citigroup consumer managed net credit losses(3) were $9.4 billion, down 3% sequentially, driven by lower losses in Retail Partner Cards and North America residential real estate in Citi Holdings.  The sequential decline in net credit losses in North America residential real estate primarily reflected a higher volume of trial loan modifications under the HAMP.  Loans in the trial modification period under the HAMP continue to remain delinquent even if the reduced payments agreed to under the program are made by the borrower.  So long as the required payments are being made, the loans are not charged off.  The decision to either charge off or record the loan as a successful modification is made only at the conclusion of the trial period.  During the quarter, the recognition of $100 million of net credit losses was deferred because the underlying mortgages were in the trial modification period under the HAMP; however the loan loss reserve was increased to offset this impact.  The impact of the HAMP also contributed to the $2.0 billion sequential increase in loans 90+ days past due in the North America residential real estate lending business.
 
                 
Outside North America, Citicorp consumer net credit losses were up 5% or $59 million sequentially, driven by increases in Latin America and EMEA.  Within Regional Consumer Banking, loans 90+ days past due declined across all regions.
 
                 
Total corporate net credit losses declined sequentially from $1.7 billion to $1.5 billion.
 
                 
Citigroup's loan loss reserve build for the quarter was $3.1 billion lower than the prior quarter and consisted of a net build of $893 million for consumer loans, and a net release of $91 million for corporate loans.  The corporate loan portfolio declined by $13 billion in the third quarter, and overall credit characteristics of this portfolio stabilized.  While the consumer loan loss reserve build was lower than the second quarter of 2009, the months of concurrent coverage increased to 13.3 from 12.7 sequentially.
 
                 
Citigroup's total allowance for loan losses was $36.4 billion, up from $35.9 billion in the prior quarter, while its total allowance for loan losses increased to 5.9% of total loans from 5.6% in the prior quarter.
 
EXPENSES
 
Citigroup's operating expenseswere $11.8 billion, down from $12.0 billion in the prior quarter.  Quarterly operating expenses were down $3.8 billion from the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting ongoing reengineering efforts and divestitures of noncore businesses.
TAXES
 
Citigroup's tax provision for the quarter was a $1.1 billion benefit reflecting a higher proportion of income earned and indefinitely reinvested in countries with relatively lower tax rates as well as a higher proportion of income from tax advantaged sources.
 
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
 
Discontinued operations net loss was $418 million versus a net loss of $142 million in the prior quarter.
 
NET INCOME
 
Citigroup's net income was $101 million versus $4.3 billion in the second quarter.  Excluding the Smith Barney gain on sale, net income was up $2.5 billion sequentially, benefitting from lower credit costs and the gain on debt extinguishment associated with the exchange offers.
 
                
Citicorp's income from continuing operations was $2.3 billion, down $0.7 billion from the prior quarter, due primarily to a higher negative CVA and lower Securities and Banking revenues, partially offset by decreases in credit costs and a lower effective tax rate.
 
                
Citi Holdings' loss from continuing operations was $1.8 billion, versus a loss of $5.3 billion in the prior quarter excluding the Smith Barney gain on sale, driven by lower credit costs and  positive net revenue marks.
 
BALANCE SHEET
 
                
Total assetswere $1.9 trillion, up 2% from the prior quarter primarily reflecting growth in cash and due from banks, and deposits with banks, partially offset by declining loans and securities.

The following measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC guidelines:

Citigroup Managed Revenues
2)
             
Citicorp Managed Revenues

Tangible Common Equity and Related Ratios
9)
             
Tier 1 Common and Related ratios
 
Reconciliation of the aforementioned non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP measure follows:
 
 
 
 
 
(1) Tier 1 Capital excludes net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities and net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values, in accordance with regulatory risk-based capital guidelines. In arriving at Tier 1 Capital, institutions are required to deduct net unrealized losses on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values, net of tax.
 
(2) The Federal Reserve Board granted interim capital relief for the impact of adopting SFAS 158.
 
(3) The impact of including Citigroup's own credit rating in valuing liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected is excluded from Tier 1 Capital, in accordance with regulatory risk-based capital guidelines.
 
(4) Of Citi's approximately $38 billion of net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2009, approximately $13 billion of such assets were includable without limitation in regulatory capital pursuant to the risk-based capital guidelines, while approximately $22 billion of such assets exceeded the limitation imposed by these guidelines and, as "disallowed deferred tax assets," were deducted in arriving at Tier 1 Capital. Citi's other approximately $3 billion of net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2009 primarily represented the deferred tax effects of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, which are permitted to be excluded prior to deriving the amount of net deferred tax assets subject to limitation under the guidelines.

Managed-basis (Managed) presentations detail certain non-GAAP financial measures. Managed presentations (applicable only to North American credit card operations, as securitizations are not done in any other regions) include results from both the on-balance sheet loans and off- balance sheet loans, and exclude the impact of card securitization activity. Managed presentations assume that securitized loans have not been sold and present the results of the securitized loans in the same manner as the Citigroup's owned loans. Citigroup believes that Managed presentations are useful to investors because they are widely used by analysts and investors within the credit card industry. Managed presentations are commonly used by other companies within the financial services industry.

Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based upon a review by the Company's Risk officers.  Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for Consumer loans. Consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due, and are charged off at 120 days past due. Residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due.
