Filed pursuant to Rule 433 File No. 333-157459
For Immediate Release Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) December 16, 2009
NEW YORK  Citi today announced the pricing of 5.4 billion common shares and 35 million tangible equity units as part of its agreement with the U.S. government and its regulators to repay U.S. taxpayers for the $20 billion the government holds in TARP trust preferred securities and to terminate the loss-sharing agreement with the government. The common stock priced at $3.15 per share, generating net proceeds of approximately $17 billion. The tangible equity units priced at $100 each, generating net proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion (about $2.8 billion counted as equity.) The combined offering of common stock and tangible equity offering was the largest public equity offering in U.S. capital markets history.
Upon completion of the offerings and the repayment of the $20 billion of the TARP trust preferred securities and the termination of the loss-sharing agreement, Citi will no longer be deemed to be a recipient of "exceptional financial assistance" under TARP.
The U.S. Treasury (UST) announced it would extend its lock-up period on the sale of its 7.7 billion share common equity stake to 90 days from 45 days after the completion of this offering. The UST decided not to sell any of its shares in connection with Citi's sale of common stock and tangible equity units.
The tangible equity units are comprised of a prepaid stock purchase contract and a junior subordinated amortizing note. Each stock purchase contract has a settlement date of December 15, 2012 and will settle for between 25.3968 and 31.7460 shares of Citi common stock, subject to adjustment as described in the final prospectus relating to the offering. The amortizing notes will pay holders equal quarterly installments of $1.875 per amortizing note, which in the aggregate will be equivalent to a 7.50% cash payment per year with respect to each $100 Stated Amount of T-DECS and has a scheduled final installment payment date of December 15, 2012. Citigroup has the right to defer installment payments on the amortizing notes at any time and from time to time but not beyond December 15, 2015.
After giving effect to the issuance of the $17 billion in common stock, $3.5 billion of tangible equity units and $1.7 billion of stock compensation previously announced by Citi, as well as the repayment of $20 billion of the TARP trust preferred securities and the termination of the loss-sharing agreement, Citi's pro forma Tier 1 capital ratio at the end of the third quarter of 2009 would have been 11.0%, compared with 12.8%. The company's pro forma Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the third quarter would have been 9.0%, compared with 9.1%.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is serving as sole book-running manager of these offerings. Citi has granted the underwriters for the common stock offerings an over-allotment option to purchase up to 809.5 million additional shares of common stock.
