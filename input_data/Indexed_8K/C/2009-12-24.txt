Citigroup Global Markets Inc.    as Representative of the several Underwriters c/o Citigroup Global Markets Inc. 388 Greenwich Street New York, New York 10013
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          Citigroup Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell to the several underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters"), for whom you (the "Representatives") are acting as representative, 5,396,825,397 shares of common stock of the Company, $0.01 par value ("Common Stock") (said shares to be issued and sold by the Company being hereinafter called the "Underwritten Securities"). The Company also proposes to grant to the Underwriters an option to purchase up to a total of 809,523,810 additional shares of Common Stock to cover over-allotments, if any (the "Option Securities"; the Option Securities, together with the Underwritten Securities, being hereinafter called the "Securities").
          The Company wishes to confirm as follows its agreement with you and the other several Underwriters listed on Schedule I on whose behalf you are acting, in connection with the several purchases of the Securities by the Underwriters. To the extent there are no additional Underwriters listed on Schedule I other than you, the term Representatives as used herein shall mean you, as Underwriter, and the terms Representatives and Underwriters shall mean either the singular or plural as the context requires. Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Exchange Act on or before the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the Effective Date of the Registration Statement or the issue date of the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference. Certain terms used herein are defined in Section 21 hereof.
 
          1. . (a) The Company hereby agrees, subject to all the terms and conditions set forth herein, to sell to each Underwriter and, upon the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements of the Company herein contained and subject to all the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at a purchase price of $3.07125 per Security, the number of Underwritten Securities set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto.
Agreements to Sell and Purchase
          (b) Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company hereby grants an option to the several Underwriters to purchase, severally and not jointly, up to 809,523,810 Option Securities at the same purchase price per share as the Underwriters shall pay for the Underwritten Securities. Said option may be exercised only to cover over-allotments in the sale of the Underwritten Securities by the Underwriters. Said option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time or from time to time on or before the 30 day after the date of the Final Prospectus, upon written, electronic or facsimile notice by the Representative to the Company setting forth the number of Option Securities as to which the several Underwriters are exercising the option and the date on which delivery and payment shall occur, which shall not be less than three Business Days after the date of the notice of exercise. The number of Option Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be the same percentage of the total number of Option Securities to be purchased by the several Underwriters as such Underwriter is purchasing of the Underwritten Securities, subject to such adjustments as the Representative, in its absolute discretion, shall make to eliminate any fractional shares.
th
          2. . It is understood that the several Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale to the public as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus.
Offering by Underwriters
          3. . Delivery to the Underwriters of, and payment for, the Underwritten Securities shall be made at the office of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York 10006, at 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on December 22, 2009 (the "Closing Date"). Delivery to the Underwriters of, and payment for, the Option Securities (if the option provided for in Section 1(b) hereof is exercised) shall be made on the date and at the time specified in the notice of exercise of the option, which shall not be less than three Business Days after the date of the notice. The place of closing for the Underwritten Securities and the Closing Date may be varied by agreement between you and the Company. If settlement for the Option Securities occurs after the Closing Date, the Company will deliver to the Representatives on the settlement date for the Option Securities, and the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase the Option Securities shall be conditioned on receipt of, supplemental opinions, certificates and letters confirming as of such date the opinions, certificates and letters delivered on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 7 hereof.
Delivery of the Securities and Payment Therefor
          Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Representative for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters directly or through the Representative of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Company by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to an account specified by the Company. Delivery of
 
the Securities shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company unless the Representative shall otherwise instruct.
          It is understood that the Representative, acting individually and not in a representative capacity, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment to the Company on behalf of any other Underwriter for Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter. Any such payment by the Representative shall not relieve any such Underwriter of any of its obligations hereunder.
          4. . The Company agrees with the several Underwriters that:
Agreements
          (a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus unless the Company has furnished the Representative a copy for its review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which they reasonably object. The Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto, to be filed in a form acceptable to the Representative with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representative of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representative (i) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (ii) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (iii) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice objecting to its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the occurrence of any such suspension or objection to the use of the Registration Statement and, upon such issuance, occurrence or notice of objection, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal of such stop order or relief from such occurrence or objection, including, if necessary, by filing an amendment to the Registration Statement or a new registration statement and using its best efforts to have such amendment or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable.
          (b) If, at any time prior to the filing of the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, the Company will (i) notify promptly the Representative so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
 
          (c) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Representative of such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Final Prospectus and (iv) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to the Representative in such quantities as the Representative may reasonably request.
          (d) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representative a consolidated earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158.
          (e) Upon request, the Company will furnish to the Representative and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representative may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering that are required to be prepared, furnished or delivered by the Company.
          (f) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as the Representative reasonably may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (as successor to the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.), in connection with its review of the offering; that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.

The Press Releases, Investor Presentation, the Final Term Sheet and any such free writing prospectus consented to by the Representative or the Company are each hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Free Writing Prospectus." The Company agrees that (x) it has treated and will treat, as the case may be, each Permitted Free Writing Prospectus as an Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and (y) it has complied and will comply, as the case may be, with the requirements of Rules 164 and 433 applicable to any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus, including in respect of timely filing with the Commission, legending and record keeping.

          (e) As of the date hereof, the Disclosure Package and the Final Term Sheet, when taken together as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 6 hereof.
          (f) (i) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), (iii) at the time the Company or any person acting on its behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c)) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption in Rule 163 and (iv) on the date hereof (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (iv)), the Company was or is (as the case may be) a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405.

The foregoing sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 6 hereof.
          Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company and delivered to the Representative or counsel for the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company, as to matters covered thereby, to each Underwriter.
          6. .
Indemnification and Contribution
          (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
          (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise
 
have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (ii) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (iii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iv) the paragraphs related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
 
investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by each of them, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Each Security has a stated amount of $100 (the "Stated Amount") and consists of (1) a prepaid stock purchase contract (each, a "Purchase Contract") under which the holder has purchased and the Company will agree to automatically deliver on December 15, 2012 (the "Purchase Contract Settlement Date"), subject to acceleration in connection with any early settlement of such Purchase Contract pursuant to the provisions thereof and of the Purchase Contract Agreement (the "Purchase Contract Agreement"), to be dated as of the Closing Date (as defined herein), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as purchase contract agent (the "Purchase Contract Agent"), a number of shares of common stock (the "Issuable Common Stock") of the Company, par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), determined pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Contract and the Purchase Contract Agreement and (2) a junior subordinated amortizing note with an initial maturity date of December 15, 2012 (each, an "Amortizing Note") issued by the Company, each of which will have an initial principal amount of $20.284 and will pay equal quarterly installments of $1.875, which in the aggregate would be equivalent to a 7.50% cash distribution per year on the Stated Amount per Security.

Agreements of the Company
          (a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to any Preliminary

          (b) If, at any time prior to the filing of the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b), any event occurs as a result of which the Disclosure Package would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made at such time not misleading, the Company will (i) notify promptly the Representative so that any use of the Disclosure Package may cease until it is amended or supplemented; (ii) amend or supplement the Disclosure Package to correct such statement or omission; and (iii) supply any amendment or supplement to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.
          (c) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement, file a new registration statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, including in connection with use or delivery of the Final Prospectus, the Company promptly will (i) notify the Representative of such event, (ii) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement or new registration statement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance, (iii) use its best efforts to have any amendment to the Registration Statement or new registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable in order to avoid any disruption in use of the Final Prospectus and (iv) supply any
 
supplemented Final Prospectus to the Representative in such quantities as the Representative may reasonably request.
          (d) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representative a consolidated earnings statement or statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158.
          (e) Upon request, the Company will furnish to the Representative and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (including in circumstances where such requirement may be satisfied pursuant to Rule 172), as many copies of any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representative may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering that are required to be prepared, furnished or delivered by the Company.
          (f) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as the Representative reasonably may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (as successor to the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.), in connection with its review of the offering; that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.

          (f) As of the date hereof, the Disclosure Package and the Final Term Sheet, when taken together as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Disclosure Package based upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 6 hereof.
          (g) (i) At the time of filing the Registration Statement, (ii) at the time of the most recent amendment thereto for the purposes of complying with Section 10(a)(3) of the Act (whether such amendment was by post-effective amendment, incorporated report filed pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or form of prospectus), (iii) at the time the Company or any person acting on their behalf (within the meaning, for this clause only, of Rule 163(c)) made any offer relating to the Securities in reliance on the exemption in Rule 163 and (iv) on the date hereof (with such date being used as the determination date for purposes of this clause (iv)), the Company was or is (as the case may be) a "well-known seasoned issuer" as defined in Rule 405.

          (h) (i) At the earliest time after the filing of the Registration Statement that the Company or another offering participant made a offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2)) of the Securities and (ii) as of the date hereof (with such date being used as the

          6. .
Indemnification and Contribution
          (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls or is under common control with any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
provided, however
 
          (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representative specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting", (ii) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (iii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iv) the paragraphs related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the
provided, however
 
indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
          (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , that in no case shall any (i) Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder or (ii) Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (the "Independent Underwriter") in its capacity as "qualified independent underwriter" (within the meaning of NASD Conduct Rule 2720 adopted by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA")) be responsible for any amount in excess of the compensation received by the Independent Underwriter for acting in such capacity. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Benefits received by the Independent Underwriter in its capacity as "qualified independent underwriter" shall be deemed to be equal to the compensation received by the Independent Underwriter for acting in such capacity. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 6, each person who controls or is under common control with an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
provided, however
 
          (e) Without limitation of and in addition to its obligations under the other paragraphs of this Section 6, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Independent Underwriter, its directors, officers, employees and agents and each person who controls or is under common control with the Independent Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which it may become subject, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon the Independent Underwriter's acting as a "qualified independent underwriter" (within the meaning of NASD Conduct Rule 2720 as adopted by FINRA) in connection with the offering contemplated by this Agreement, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Independent Underwriter.
provided
however
          7. . The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the date hereof and the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

Insofar as such opinion involves factual matters, such counsel may rely, to the extent such counsel deems proper, upon certificates of officers of the Company, its subsidiaries and certificates of public officials.
          (c) The Company shall have requested and caused Michael J. Tarpley, Associate General CounselCapital Markets of the Company, to have furnished to the Representative an opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representative, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Securities Agreements, the Registration

          (h) Subsequent to the date hereof, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.

          9. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 7 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 12 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through the Representative on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be obligated to authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder or deliver any Equity-Linked Security in exchange for any other Equity-Linked Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange on or after the Business Day immediately preceding the earliest of the Mandatory Settlement Date, any Early Settlement Date, any Early Mandatory Settlement Date or any Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date with respect to such Equity-Linked Security. In lieu of delivery of a new Equity-Linked Security, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, if the Mandatory Settlement Date, any Early Settlement Date, any Early Mandatory Settlement Date or any Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date shall have occurred with respect to such Equity-Linked Security, deliver the shares of Common Stock deliverable in respect of the Purchase Contracts evidenced by such Equity-Linked Security (together with the Separate Note, if such Equity-Linked Security is a Unit).

Book-Entry Interests.
          (i) the provisions of this Section 3.09 shall be in full force and effect;
     (ii) except as contemplated in the definition of "Holders" in Section 1.01(d), the Company shall be entitled to deal with the Depositary for all purposes of this
 
Agreement (including receiving approvals, votes or consents hereunder) as the Holder of the Global Units and Global Purchase Contracts and shall have no obligation to the Beneficial Owners;
     (iii) to the extent that the provisions of this Section 3.06 conflict with any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 3.06 shall control; and
     (iv) the rights of the Beneficial Owners shall be exercised only through the Depositary and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Beneficial Owners and the Depositary or the Depositary Participants.
     Section 3.07. Whenever a notice or other communication to the Holders is required to be given under this Agreement, the Company or the Company's agent shall give such notices and communications to the Holders and, with respect to any Units or Purchase Contracts registered in the name of the Depositary or the nominee of the Depositary, the Company or the Company's agent shall, except as set forth herein, have no obligations to the Beneficial Owners.
Notices to Holders.
     Section 3.08. If the Depositary elects to discontinue its services as securities depositary with respect to the Units or Purchase Contracts, the Company may, in its sole discretion, appoint a successor Depositary with respect to such Units or such Purchase Contracts, as the case may be.

Definitive Securities.
     If:

     (ii) an Event of Default occurs and is continuing; or
     (iii) the Company elects, in its sole discretion, to terminate the book-entry system for the Global Securities,
then (x) Definitive Securities shall be prepared by the Company with respect to such Global Securities and delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent and the Trustee, as appropriate, and (y) upon surrender of such Global Securities by the Depositary, accompanied by registration instructions, the Company shall cause Definitive Securities to be delivered to Beneficial Owners in accordance with the instructions of the Depositary. The Company shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions. Each Definitive Security so delivered shall evidence Units, Purchase Contracts or Notes, as the case may be, of the same kind and tenor as the Global
 
Security so surrendered in respect thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exchange of Global Notes for Notes in definitive form shall be governed by the Indenture.
     Section 3.10. If any mutilated Equity-Linked Security is surrendered to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Equity-Linked Security, evidencing the same number of Units or Separate Purchase Contracts, as the case may be, and bearing a security number not contemporaneously outstanding.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
     If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Equity-Linked Security, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be reasonable required by them to hold each of them and any agent of any of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent that such Equity-Linked Security has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Equity-Linked Security, a new Equity-Linked Security, evidencing the same number of Units or Separate Purchase Contracts, as the case may be, and bearing a security number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be obligated to authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, an Equity-Linked Security on or after the Business Day immediately preceding the earliest of the Mandatory Settlement Date, any Early Settlement Date, any Early Mandatory Settlement Date or any Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date with respect to such Equity-Linked Securities. In lieu of delivery of a new Equity-Linked Security, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent shall if the Mandatory Settlement Date, any Early Settlement Date, any Early Mandatory Settlement Date or any Fundamental Change Early Settlement Date with respect to such Equity-Linked Securities has occurred, deliver the shares of Common Stock deliverable in respect of the Purchase Contracts evidenced by such Equity-Linked Security (together with the Separate Note, if such Equity-Linked Securities is a Unit).
     Upon the issuance of any new Equity-Linked Security under this Section 3.10, the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require the payment by the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Purchase Contract Agent) connected therewith.
     Every new Equity-Linked Security issued pursuant to this Section 3.10 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Equity-Linked Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company and of the Holder in respect of the Unit or Separate Purchase Contract, as the case may be, evidenced thereby, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen
 
Equity-Linked Security shall be found at any time. Such new Equity-Linked Security (and the Units or Separate Purchase Contracts, as applicable, evidenced thereby) shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits and be subject to all the obligations of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Equity-Linked Securities delivered hereunder.
     The provisions of this Section 3.10 are exclusive and shall preclude, to the extent lawful, all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Equity-Linked Securities.
     Section 3.11. Prior to due presentment of an Equity-Linked Security for registration of transfer, the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent, and any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent, may treat the Person in whose name such Equity-Linked Security is registered as the owner of the Unit or Purchase Contract, as the case may be, evidenced thereby, for the purpose of performance of the Units or Purchase Contracts, as applicable, evidenced by such Equity-Linked Securities and for all other purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Purchase Contract Agent, nor any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent, shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
Persons Deemed Owners.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Unit or Global Purchase Contract, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent or any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary (or its nominee), as a Holder, with respect to such Global Unit or Global Purchase Contract or impair, as between such Depositary and the related Beneficial Owner, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of rights of the Depositary (or its nominee) as Holder of such Global Unit or Global Purchase Contract.
     Section 3.12. All Securities surrendered for separation or recreation and all Equity-Linked Securities surrendered for settlement or upon the registration of transfer or exchange of a Purchase Contract shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Purchase Contract Agent, be delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent and, if not already cancelled, be promptly cancelled by it. In the case of a Unit or Units surrendered for settlement, the Company and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and deliver in accordance with the terms of the Indenture to the Holder thereof a number of Separate Notes equal to the number of, and in the same form as, the Units so surrendered. The Company may at any time deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent for cancellation any Equity-Linked Securities previously authenticated, executed and delivered hereunder that the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Equity-Linked Securities so delivered shall, upon an Issuer Order, be promptly cancelled by the Purchase Contract Agent. No Equity-Linked Securities shall be authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holder and delivered in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. All cancelled Equity-Linked Securities held by the Purchase Contract Agent shall be disposed of in accordance with its customary practices.
Cancellation.
 
     If the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall acquire any Equity-Linked Security, such acquisition shall not operate as a cancellation of such Equity-Linked Security unless and until such Equity-Linked Security is delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent for cancellation.

Exhibit 99.1
For Immediate Release Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) December 23, 2009
NEW YORK  Citi today announced it has completed the previously announced repayment of $20 billion invested in the company by the U.S. government through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and terminated the loss-sharing agreement with the government. The repayment of the TARP trust preferred securities and termination of the loss-sharing agreement follow the successful completion of a securities offering in which Citi raised $20.5 billion, including $17 billion in common shares and $3.5 billion in tangible equity units.
To repay the TARP investment, Citi repurchased $20 billion of TARP trust preferred securities. As part of the agreement to end the loss-sharing program, the government has cancelled $1.8 billion of trust preferred securities that were part of the $7.1 billion paid in consideration for the program. The government continues to hold $5.3 billion in trust preferred securities.
The U.S. Treasury continues to hold warrants to buy Citi common stock issued as part of the TARP investment and 7.7 billion common shares, which it said it plans to sell in 2010.
After giving effect to the issuance of the $17 billion in common stock, $3.5 billion of tangible equity units and $1.7 billion of stock compensation previously announced by Citi, as well as the repayment of $20 billion of the TARP trust preferred securities and the termination of the loss-sharing agreement, Citi's pro forma Tier 1 capital ratio at the end of the third quarter of 2009 would have been 11.0%, compared with 12.8%. The company's pro forma Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the third quarter would have been 9.0%, compared with 9.1%.
Citi, the leading global financial services company, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 140 countries. Through Citicorp and Citi Holdings, Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, and wealth management. Additional information may be found at www.citigroup.com or .

Certain statements in this release, including without limitation the execution of the proposed transactions and the exiting of the loss-sharing agreement with the U.S. government, the expected impact of these transactions on Citi's Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 common capital ratio, and the financial and accounting input of the transactions, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from those included in these statements due to a variety of factors, including the actual completion of the proposed transactions and the final analysis of the financial, accounting and regulatory capital treatment of the transactions.
