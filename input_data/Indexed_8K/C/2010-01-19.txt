Exhibit 99.1
 
 
For Immediate Release
Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C)
January 19, 2010
 
New York  Citigroup today reported a full year 2009 net loss of $1.6 billion, or $0.80 per share.  Managed revenues were $91.1 billion for the year.  The fourth quarter 2009 net loss was $7.6 billion, or $0.33 per share.  Excluding the $6.2 billion after-tax loss associated with TARP repayment and exiting the loss-sharing agreement, the fourth quarter net loss was $1.4 billion or $0.06 per share.
 
The provision for loan losses(3) in the fourth quarter was $8.2 billion, down 36% from the prior year and 10% from the prior quarter.
 
"We have made enormous progress in 2009," said Vikram Pandit, Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup.  "It was our responsibility to get our own house in order.  We greatly improved Citi's capital strength, reduced the size and scope of the company, and refocused our business strategy to take advantage of our unmatched global network.  We created Citi Holdings to rationalize non-strategic businesses, totally overhauled risk management, cut costs by over $13 billion annually, reduced headcount by 100,000, and reduced assets by $500 billion from peak levels.  And to take advantage of all these changes, we assembled a talented new management team focused on the new Citicorp franchise to move us forward.
 
"We also completed the repayment of $20 billion invested in the company by the U.S. government through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and exited the loss-sharing agreement with the government," said Mr. Pandit.  "As we enter 2010, we are strongly capitalized, significantly more efficient, and are executing on a clear

strategy that is focused on clients.  With the commitment and dedication of our people, we have created a strong foundation for the future."
 
Mr. Pandit concluded: "In the near term, we will continue to focus on sustainable profitability and growth, and supporting the global economic recovery.  I believe we are positioned for long-term success, and have a strategy that combines our international footprint, global talent and unique capabilities to serve our clients and customers here and around the world.  We serve nearly every Fortune 500 company and 85% of the top global companies, enabling liquidity and capital flows by providing the financial infrastructure that facilitates these companies' international operations.  Citi is one of the great franchises in financial services, and with our renewed financial strength and strategy, we can now completely focus on executing this strategy."
 
Commenting on Citi's financial results, John Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer of Citigroup, said: "We have made significant progress in 2009. While the environment continues to be challenging, we have a strong capital base and client franchise.  Although we remain cautious and continue to monitor the future impacts of our current loss mitigation efforts, we continue to see indications that credit may be stabilizing or improving, particularly in Asia and Latin America."
 
KEY ITEMS

.  Excluding goodwill impairments and restructuring/repositioning charges recorded in 2008, operating expenses were down 15%.
 
               
Fourth quarter managed revenues were $7.9 billion
, or $17.9 billion excluding a $10.1 billion pre-tax loss associated with the TARP repayment and exiting the loss-sharing agreement, down from $23.1 billion in the third quarter, which included a $1.4 billion pre-tax gain from the extinguishment of debt associated with the exchange offers.

were down $0.8 billion from the prior quarter, marking the second consecutive quarter of improvement. Managed net credit losses were $10.0 billion, down from $11.0 billion in the prior quarter.

Citi is also currently helping more than 1.5 million credit card members to manage their card debt through a variety of forbearance programs.

REVENUES
 
Citigroup
fourth quarter revenueswere $5.4 billion, or $15.5 billion excluding the loss on the repayment of TARP and exiting the loss-sharing agreement, down from $20.4 billion in the prior quarter which included a $1.4 billion gain from the extinguishment of debt associated with the exchange offers.
 
Citicorp
fourth quarter revenues were $11.7 billion, down from $13.0 billion in the prior quarter.  Managed revenues were $13.4 billion, down from $14.8 billion in the prior quarter.  Excluding the impact of CVA in each quarter, managed revenues were down approximately 7% sequentially, due primarily to declines in S&B revenues.
 
                 
RCB revenues were $5.7 billion, up 1% sequentially.  Managed revenues of $7.5 billion were flat with the prior quarter. Average deposits of $288 billion were up 5% sequentially, driven by growth in all regions.  Average retail banking loans increased 4% sequentially to $80.6 billion, while Citi-branded cards average managed loans were up 1% sequentially to $114.2 billion.
 
                 
North America RCB revenues of $1.6 billion were down 6% sequentially and managed revenues were $3.4 billion, down 5% sequentially.  The decline in managed revenues was mainly driven by lower card revenues due to implementation of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the CARD Act).
 
                 
EMEA RCB revenues were $0.4 billion, down 7% sequentially due to declining margins.
 
                 
Latin America RCB revenues were $1.9 billion, up from $1.8 billion in the prior quarter driven by increasing deposits, loan balances and card purchase sales, as well as by the impact of foreign exchange.  Revenues increased in both cards and retail banking.
 
                 
Asia RCB revenues of $1.8 billion were up 6% sequentially driven by increasing investment sales and loan and deposit volumes within retail banking, as well as increasing purchase sales and loan volumes within cards.  Revenue increases also included the impact of foreign exchange.
 
                 
S&B revenues declined to $3.5 billion from $4.9 billion in the prior quarter. Fourth quarter S&B revenues included a negative CVA of $1.9 billion, of which $840 million pre-tax ($518 million after-tax) represented the cumulative impact of a correction of an error in calculating the CVA on the company's fair value option debt in prior periods. Excluding the impact of CVA, revenues were $5.4 billion compared to $6.6 billion in the prior quarter.  The $1.2 billion sequential decline in revenues excluding CVA was primarily driven by lower revenues in fixed income and equity markets reflecting lower market volatility and a decline in market volumes.
 
                 
Investment banking revenues were $1.5 billion, up 25% sequentially, driven by strength in advisory and equity underwriting partially offset by lower debt issuance volume.
 
                 
Equity markets revenues were $31 million ($0.7 billion excluding CVA) versus $0.4 billion ($1.3 billion excluding CVA) in the prior quarter.  The $0.6 billion sequential decline in revenues excluding CVA was primarily driven by weaker market activity and lower volatility.
 
                 
Fixed income markets revenues were $1.8 billion ($3.0 billion excluding CVA) versus $3.9 billion ($4.7 billion excluding CVA) in the prior quarter.  The $1.7 billion sequential decline in revenues excluding CVA was primarily driven by weaker trading results as lower market volatility led to a reduction in trading opportunities.
 
                 
Lending revenues were negative $0.2 billion versus negative $0.7 billion in the prior quarter driven by lower credit default swap losses.  In addition, the net interest margin of the portfolio increased during the quarter as improved pricing more than offset the impact of a decline in the size of the loan book.
 
                 
Private Bank revenues were $0.6 billion, up 7% sequentially.  Excluding the impact of CVA (negative $6 million and negative $39 million in the fourth and third quarter, respectively), revenues were up 1% sequentially.
 
                 
Transaction Services revenues were $2.5 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter, as higher deposits and increased volumes offset spread compression.  Average deposits and other customer liability balances increased $21 billion, or 7% during the quarter to $335 billion.  End of period assets under custody were $12.1 trillion.
 
 
Citi Holdings
fourth quarter revenues were $4.7 billion versus $6.7 billion in the prior quarter.  Managed revenues were $5.5 billion during the quarter, down from $7.6 billion in the prior quarter. Key drivers of the decline included lower positive net revenue marks within the Special Asset Pool (SAP) of $0.2 billion versus $1.5 billion in the prior quarter (see Appendix A), as well as the prior quarter's $0.3 billion pre-tax gain on the sale of Citigroup's Managed Futures business, and lower net interest revenue within Local Consumer Lending. SAP asset sales of approximately $10 billion resulted in $0.8 billion of pre-tax gains during the quarter.
 
Corporate/Other
fourth quarter revenues were negative $11.0 billion down from positive $0.7 billion in the prior quarter, due to the $10.1 billion pre-tax loss on the TARP repayment and exiting the loss-sharing agreement, and the prior quarter's $1.4 billion pre-tax gain from the extinguishment of debt associated with the exchange offers.
 
EXPENSES
 
Citigroup
fourth quarter operating expenseswere $12.3 billion, up from $11.8 billion in the prior quarter.
 
Citicorp
fourth quarter operating expenses were $8.5 billion, up from $8.2 billion in the prior quarter driven primarily by higher marketing and investment spending in Latin America and Asia RCB, increases in repositioning expenses, and the impact of foreign exchange.
 
Citi Holdings
fourth quarter operating expenses were $3.3 billion, up 2% from the prior quarter, driven by higher repositioning costs and increased collections expense, primarily in U.S. mortgages.
 
CREDIT
 
Citigroup
fourth quarter credit costs of $8.2 billion included net credit losses of $7.1 billion, a $0.7 billion net loan loss reserve build and a $0.3 billion provision for policyholder benefits and claims.  Net credit losses were down 10% from the prior quarter.  Total credit costs declined 10% sequentially, to the lowest level since the second quarter of 2008.
 
                 
Citigroup fourth quarter consumer managed net credit losses were $8.9 billion, down 6% sequentially, driven by lower losses across most consumer lending portfolios, due in part to loss mitigation efforts.
 
                 
Total corporate net credit losses declined sequentially to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, from $1.5 billion, reflecting continued stabilization in corporate credit quality, and declines in the size of the portfolio. The corporate loan portfolio declined by $13.3 billion in the fourth quarter to $167.4 billion
 
                 
Citigroup's loan loss reserve build for the quarter was $0.7 billion, down from $0.8 billion in the prior quarter, and consisted of a build of $1.0 billion for consumer loans, and a release of $0.3 billion for corporate loans.
 
                 
The consumer loan loss reserve was $28.4 billion at year-end, representing 14.1 months of concurrent coverage, up from 13.3 months of coverage at the end of the third quarter.
 
                 
Citigroup's total allowance for loan losses at year-end was $36.0 billion or 6.1% of total loans, compared to $36.4 billion or 5.9% of total loans in the prior quarter.
 
Citicorp
fourth quarter credit costs were $1.6 billion, consisting essentially of net credit losses.  Citicorp managed net credit losses were $3.3 billion, down 8% sequentially.
 
                 
North America RCB managed net credit losses were $2.0 billion, down 6% from the prior quarter reflecting a decline in credit losses in the Citi-branded card portfolio driven by loss mitigation efforts.
 
                 
EMEA RCB net credit losses were $138 million, flat with the prior quarter.  The reserve build was $10 million, down from $67 million in the prior quarter.
 
                 
Latin America RCB net credit losses were $626 million, down $30 million sequentially driven by lower credit losses in the Mexico card portfolio, reflecting loss mitigation programs and improving economic conditions.  The reserve release was $3 million versus a build of $141 million in the prior quarter.
 
                 
Asia RCB net credit losses were $306 million, down from $351 million in the prior quarter, as retail banking and card net credit losses declined broadly across the region. The reserve build of $79 million was flat with the prior quarter.
 
 
                 
S&B net credit losses were $181 million, down from $294 million in the prior quarter.  The reserve release was $141 million versus a build of $151 million in the prior quarter, reflecting declines in lending balances and stabilizing corporate credit.
 
                 
Transaction Services net credit losses were $5 million in the fourth quarter versus net recoveries of $2 million in the third quarter.  The reserve build was $3 million versus release of $5 million in the prior quarter.
 
Citi Holdings
fourth quarter credit costs were $6.6 billion, and included $5.6 billion of net credit losses, a $0.7 billion reserve build and a $0.3 billion provision for policyholder benefits and claims.  Managed net credit losses were $6.7 billion, down 9% from the prior quarter.
 
                 
North America retail partner card managed net credit losses declined 2% sequentially to $2.0 billion, reflecting tightened underwriting standards and loss mitigation efforts.
 
                 
Net credit losses in North America residential real estate lending declined 7% sequentially to $2.1 billion due primarily to lower losses on second mortgages reflecting the impact of portfolio re-positioning and loss mitigation.  In addition, increasing volumes of trial modifications of first mortgages under the HAMP contributed to the sequential decline in losses; the loan loss reserve was increased to offset this impact.
 
                 
International consumer net credit losses declined 18% sequentially to $0.8 billion driven by improvements in Asia and EMEA.
 
                 
Within the Special Asset Pool, net credit losses declined to $950 million from $1.3 billion in the prior quarter due to lower write-offs of corporate loans.
 
TAXES
 
Citigroup's tax provision for the quarter was a $7.4 billion benefit reflecting a higher proportion of income being earned and indefinitely reinvested in countries with relatively lower tax rates as well as a higher proportion of income from tax advantaged sources.
 
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
 
Discontinued operations net income in the fourth quarter was $232 million versus a net loss of $418 million in the prior quarter, due to the sale of Nikko Cordial Securities completed during the quarter.
 
NET INCOME
 
Citigroup's net loss was $7.6 billion in the fourth quarter versus $0.1 billion of net income in the third quarter.  Excluding the impact of the TARP repayment and exiting the loss-sharing agreement in the fourth quarter and the gain on debt extinguishment associated with the exchange offers in the third quarter, net income was lower by $0.6 billion sequentially.  The impact of the TARP repayment, exiting of the loss-sharing agreement and the gain on debt extinguishment were recorded in the Corporate/Other segment.
 
Citicorp
fourth quarter net income was $1.7 billion, down from $2.3 billion from the prior quarter, as declines in S&B revenues and higher operating expenses were partially offset by sequential declines in credit costs across businesses. Income growth in Asia and Latin America was offset by declines in North America and EMEA.
 
Citi Holdings
fourth quarter net loss was $2.5 billion versus a loss of $1.9 billion in the prior quarter as a sequential decline in credit costs was more than offset by a reduction in positive revenue marks, lower net interest revenue and the absence of the $0.2 billion after-tax gain on the sale of Citigroup's Managed Futures business in the quarter.
 
BALANCE SHEET
 
Total assetswere $1.9 trillion, down 2% from the third quarter reflecting business dispositions and asset sales within Citi Holdings.  During the quarter approximately $46 billion of cash and deposits with banks were redeployed into liquid securities held in the available-for-sale portfolio.

The Company adopted FSP EITF 03-6-1 on January 1, 2009.  All prior periods have been restated to conform to the current presentation.  The Diluted EPS calculation for all periods in 2008, and the first, third and fourth quarters in 2009, utilize Basic shares and Income available to common shareholders (Basic) due to the negative Income available to common shareholders.

The first quarter of 2009 Income available to common shareholders includes a reduction of $1.285 billion related to the conversion price reset (triggered on January 23, 2009) pursuant to Citigroup's prior agreement with the purchasers of the $12.5 billion convertible preferred stock issued in a private offering in January 2008, the conversion price was reset from $31.62 per share to $26.35 per share.  There was no impact to net income, total stockholders' equity or capital ratios due to the reset. However, the reset resulted in a reclassification from Retained earnings to Additional paid-in capital of $1.285 billion and a reduction in Income available to common shareholders of $1.285 billion. Income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2008, first quarter of 2009, second quarter of 2009 and third quarter of 2009 includes a reduction of $ 37 million, $53 million, $54 million and $16 million, respectively, related to the preferred stock Series H quarterly discount accretion.  Income available to common shareholders for the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2009 includes a reduction of $ 3.1 billion and $187 million, respectively, related to the Public and Private Exchange Offers.

Managed-basis (Managed) presentations detail certain non-GAAP financial measures.  Managed presentations (applicable only to North American credit card operations, as securitizations are not done in any other regions) include results from both the on-balance sheet loans and off- balance sheet loans, and exclude the impact of card securitization activity. Managed presentations assume that securitized loans have not been sold and present the results of the securitized loans in the same manner as Citigroup's owned loans. Citigroup believes that Managed presentations are useful to investors because they are widely used by analysts and investors within the credit card industry. Managed presentations are commonly used by other companies within the financial services industry.
 
The following tables present a reconciliation of Citigroup's Managed presentations within this Financial Data Supplement to their most comparable GAAP measure.
