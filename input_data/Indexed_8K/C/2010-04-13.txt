(d)   Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
(1)   The Company adopted FSP EITF 03-6-1 on January 1, 2009.  All prior periods have been restated to conform to the current presentation.  The Diluted EPS calculation for all periods in 2008, and the first, third and fourth quarters in 2009, utilize Basic shares and Income available to common shareholders (Basic) due to the negative Income available to common shareholders. Using actual Diluted shares and Income available to common shareholders (Diluted) would result in anti-dilution.
 
(2)   The first quarter of 2009 Income available to common shareholders includes a reduction of $1.285 billion related to the conversion price reset (triggered on January 23, 2009) pursuant to Citigroup's prior agreement with the purchasers of the $12.5 billion convertible preferred stock issued in a private offering in January 2008, the conversion price was reset from $31.62 per share to $26.35 per share.  There was no impact to net income, total stockholders' equity or capital ratios due to the reset. However, the reset resulted in a reclassification from Retained earnings to Additional paid-in capital of $1.285 billion and a reduction in Income available to common shareholders of $1.285 billion. Income available to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2008, first quarter of 2009, second quarter of 2009 and third quarter of 2009 includes a reduction of $37 million, $53 million, $54 million and $16 million, respectively, related to the preferred stock Series H quarterly discount accretion.  Income available to common shareholders for the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2009 includes a reduction of $ 3.1 billion and $187 million, respectively, related to the Public and Private Exchange Offers.
 
(3)   Tangible Book Value per Share is a Non-GAAP financial measure.  See page 46 for a reconciliation of this measure to its most comparable GAAP measure.
Reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Other revenue for the second quarter of 2009 includes $11.1 billion ($6.7 billion after-tax) related to the sale of Smith Barney and establishment of the Joint Venture with Morgan Stanley.  Other revenue for the fourth quarter of 2009 includes $10.1 billion loss ($6.2 billion after-tax) related to the Company's debt extinguishment in connection with the repayment of TARP and exit from the U.S. Government Loss-sharing Agreement.
 
(2)
         
Discontinued Operations includes:
a)
              
The sale of substantially all of Citigroup's CitiCapital equipment finance unit to General Electric.
b)
             
The sale of substantially all of Citigroup's Retail Banking Operations in Germany to Credit Mutuel.
c)
              
The sale of Nikko Cordial Securities to Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.
 
Reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
 
 
 
(1)   Includes allowance for credit losses for letters of credit and unfunded lending commitments of $1,250 million for the first quarter of 2008, $1,107 million for the second quarter of 2008, $957 million for the third quarter of 2008, and $887 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, respectively, and $947 million for the first quarter of 2009,$1,082 million for the second quarter of 2009, $1,074 million for the third quarter of 2009 and $1,151 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, respectively.

Citigroup adopted SFAS 166/167 effective January 1, 2010.  Beginning in the 2010 first quarter there is no longer a difference between GAAP Revenues and NCLs and those for Managed Revenues and NCLs.
Prior quarters' Managed Revenues and NCLs are included herein for comparative purposes to the 2010 first quarter revenues.  See below for a discussion of Managed-basis reporting.
Managed basis reporting impacts the North America Regional Consumer Banking - Citi Branded Cards and the Local Consumer Lending   Retail Partner Cards businesses.
The historical disclosures reflect the impact from credit card securitizations only.
The information above reconciles Managed disclosures to the most-relevant GAAP disclosures.
 
(2)
         
Managed-basis (Managed) presentations detail certain non-GAAP financial measures.  Managed presentations (applicable only to North American credit card operations, as securitizations are not done in any other regions) include results from both the on-balance sheet loans and off- balance sheet loans, and exclude the impact of card securitization activity. Managed presentations assume that securitized loans have not been sold and present the results of the securitized loans in the same manner as Citigroup's owned loans. Citigroup believes that Managed presentations are useful to investors because they are widely used by analysts and investors within the credit card industry. Managed presentations are commonly used by other companies within the financial services industry.
See pages 43 - 46 for additional reconciliations of managed measures to their most comparable GAAP measure.
 
(3)
         
Net impact of Credit Card Securitization Activity includes the removal of securitization-related items that are part of GAAP revenues such as the gain on sale of credit card loans, mark-to-market revenue for interests retained in securitized assets classified as Trading, and net credit losses on loans that are considered sold for GAAP purposes.

Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based upon a review by the Company's Risk officers.  Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for Consumer loans. Consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due, and are charged off at 120 days past due. Residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Credit card loans accrue interest until 180 days past due, at which time they are charged off.
