Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 26, 2010, Citigroup Inc. (Citi), the United States Department of the Treasury (the U.S. Treasury) and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated (Morgan Stanley) entered into an equity distribution agreement (the Equity Distribution Agreement).  Pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement, the U.S. Treasury may offer and sell from time to time up to 7,692,307,692 shares of Citi common stock it currently holds (the Shares) through Morgan Stanley as sales agent or principal.  The U.S. Treasury may also sell the Shares to Morgan Stanley as principal under a separate agreement and at a price agreed at the time of sale.  Citi will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Shares by the U.S. Treasury.
The foregoing description of the Equity Distribution Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the Equity Distribution Agreement, a copy of which is being filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
The U.S. Treasury acquired the Shares from Citi in connection with Citis participation in the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).  On October 28, 2008, Citi issued to the U.S. Treasury $25 billion of its perpetual preferred stock as part of the TARP Capital Purchase Program.  This perpetual preferred stock was exchanged for the Shares on July 23, 2009 and July 30, 2009.  As of March 31, 2010, the U.S. Treasury held approximately 26.88% of the outstanding Citi common stock.  In an agreement with the U.S. Treasury, Citi has agreed to reimburse the U.S. Treasury for all discounts, selling commissions, stock transfer taxes and transaction fees, if any, applicable to the sale of the Shares and fees and disbursements of counsel for the U.S. Treasury incurred in connection with any such sale.
In the ordinary course of their business, Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates have in the past performed, and may continue to perform, investment banking, broker dealer, lending, financial advisory or other services for Citi for which they have received, or may receive, separate fees.

Indemnity and Contribution.
 
(b)           The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to the Manager, but only with reference to information relating to the Manager furnished to the Company in writing by the Manager expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement (including any Interim Prospectus Supplement), the General Disclosure Package, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any amendment or supplement thereto.
 
(c)           In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the ) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the ) in writing, and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.

Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

(d)           To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Manager, on the other hand, from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by Section 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in Section 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Manager, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Manager, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Stockholder bear to the total commissions received by the Manager.  The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Manager, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Manager and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  
 
18
 
(e)           The Company and the Manager agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d).  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, the Manager shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares sold by it were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that the Manager has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
 
(f)           The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Manager, any person controlling the Manager or any affiliate of the Manager or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
 
(g)           The provisions of this Section 8 shall not be deemed to supersede or otherwise affect provisions of Section 4.6(g) of the Exchange Agreement dated June 9, 2009 between the Company and the Selling Stockholder with respect to the rights (including the rights of their respective agents) and obligations of each of them to the other pursuant thereto.
 
9.             .  This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.

Termination

(b)           This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until the earliest to occur of the following: (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10(a) above, (ii) such time as all Shares have been sold pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or (iii) this Agreement is otherwise terminated by mutual agreement of the parties; that any such termination by mutual agreement or pursuant to this clause (b) shall in all cases be deemed to provide that Section 1 and Section 8 of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
provided
 
(c)           Any termination of this Agreement shall be effective on the date specified in such notice of termination; that such termination shall not be effective until the close of business on the date of receipt of such notice by the Company and the Manager.  If such termination shall occur prior to the Settlement Date for any sale of Shares, such sale shall settle in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.
provided
 
(d)           In the case of a Principal Purchase pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Manager may terminate such Terms Agreement by notice given by the Manager to the Company and the Selling Stockholder, if after the execution and delivery of the Terms Agreement and prior to the related Settlement Date:
 
(i) there have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Companys debt securities by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change;
   
 
(ii)           there have been (A) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in Section 4(d) or (B) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business, operations or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from the respective dates of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package and the prospectus supplement related to such Principal Purchase that, in the Managers judgment, is material and adverse and that makes it, in the Managers judgment, impracticable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus and the prospectus supplement related to such Principal Purchase; or
 
20
 
(iii)          (A) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Market, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade or other relevant exchanges, (B) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (C) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (D) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (E) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this Section 10(d), makes it, in the Managers judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus and the prospectus supplement related to such Principal Purchase.
 
If such Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant this Section 10(d), then the Manager may cause the Selling Stockholder to cancel the purchase by the Manager as principal of all or a portion of such Shares, and each of the Manager and the Selling Stockholder shall be released from any of its obligations under Section 3 with respect to such Shares.  The Company shall hold the Manager and the Selling Stockholder harmless against any loss, claim, damage or expense (including reasonable legal fees and expenses), as incurred, arising out of or in connection with the cancellation of any purchase pursuant to this Section 10(d).

The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims they may have against the Manager arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the sale and distribution of the Shares.
