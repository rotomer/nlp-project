Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
New York, July 16, 2010  Citigroup Inc. today reported second quarter 2010 net income of $2.7 billion or $0.09 per diluted share, on revenues of $22.1 billion, marking a second consecutive profitable quarter.  Citigroup earned $7.1 billion of net income in the first six months of 2010.
 
Revenues declined $3.4 billion and net income was down $1.7 billion from the first quarter of 2010, largely as a result of lower and revenues.  Other core businesses showed consistent strength, including with $929 million in net income and sequential revenue growth across all international regions.

Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims declined $2.0 billion sequentially to $6.7 billion, the lowest level since the third quarter of 2007, reflecting continued improvement in credit quality.  This helped increase net income by 16% sequentially to $1.2 billion.

Although Citigroup maintained expense discipline, expenses were up 3% sequentially, reflecting the impact of the U.K. bonus tax.

"I am pleased that we have produced solid operating results for the second consecutive quarter," said Vikram Pandit, Chief Executive Officer of Citi.  "We continue to execute our strategy of serving clients with our unique global footprint in both the developed and emerging markets.  Most importantly, Citi's quarter-million people around the world are working tirelessly for our clients and shareholders.
 
"While the market environment lowered revenues in Securities and Banking, credit improved for the fourth consecutive quarter.  We saw growth internationally, particularly in Transaction Services and Regional Consumer Banking in Latin America and Asia.  We continue to reduce the size of Citi Holdings, and it now makes up less than a quarter of Citigroup's balance sheet," added Mr. Pandit.
 
Citigroup has been focusing on its core businesses in Citicorp  and  while continuing to divest non-core businesses in Citi Holdings.  In the second quarter of 2010, Citicorp earned $3.8 billion while Citi Holdings had a loss of $1.2 billion.  Citi Holdings reduced its assets by $38 billion in the second quarter and by a total of $362 billion since the peak in the first quarter of 2008, for a 44% reduction.  Citi Holdings now represents less than 25% of Citigroup's assets compared to 38% at its peak.

Regional Consumer Banking
 
Citigroup continues to increase its financial strength and is one of the best capitalized banks in the world, as indicated by $122.9 billion in Tier 1 Capital and a Tier 1 Common ratio of 9.7%.  In addition, it has common equity of $154.5 billion and $46.2 billion in loan loss reserves.
 
"Although economic conditions remain challenging and global regulatory frameworks are uncertain, we believe these results demonstrate that the difficult decisions made by our management team have put in place all the elements for sustained profitability," concluded Mr. Pandit.

Regional Consumer Banking
("RCB") revenues were $8.0 billion, down $50 million, or 1%, sequentially, as declines in North America and EMEA were partially offset by continued growth in Asia and Latin America.  Average loans declined 2% to $218 billion, as growth in Latin America and Asia was offset by declining balances in North America and EMEA.  Average deposits were up 1% to $291 billion, driven by Asia and North America.  International investment sales declined 3% to $23.4 billion.
                 
North America
revenues were $3.7 billion, down $108 million, or 3%, sequentially, driven by a $151 million decrease in Citi-branded card revenues.  The decline in card revenues primarily reflects the impact of The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act, as well as lower card volumes.  Average card loans decreased 4% to $76.2 billion, mainly due to higher payment rates and fewer accounts, partially offset by a 9% increase in purchase sales.  Retail banking average loans declined 5% to $30.7 billion, largely reflecting a decline in mortgages.  Average deposits increased 1% to $145.5 billion.
RCB
 
                 
EMEA
revenues were $376 million, down $29 million, or 7%, sequentially, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange in the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes ("impact of foreign exchange").  Average loans and deposits declined 9% and 8%, respectively, also reflecting the impact of foreign exchange.
RCB
 
                 
Latin America
revenues were $2.1 billion, up $42 million, or 2%, sequentially, driven by higher volumes.  Average card loans were down 1%, as a 1% growth in accounts and a 3% increase in purchase sales were offset by a decline in average loans in Mexico, as this business continues to be repositioned.  Average deposits were up 1% and retail banking average loans grew 5%, mainly driven by Mexico.  Investment sales declined 8%.
RCB
 
                 
Asia
revenues were $1.8 billion, up $45 million, or 3%, from the prior quarter, driven by higher lending and cards revenues.  Average card loans declined 1%, as a 3% increase in purchase sales was offset by a decline in loans in India, as this business continues to be repositioned.  Average deposits were up 1%, investment sales were up 8%, and retail banking average loans increased 2%.
RCB
 
                 
Securities and Banking
revenues were $6.0 billion, down $2.0 billion, or 26%, sequentially, driven by lower Fixed Income Markets, Equity Markets, and Investment Banking revenues.
 
                 
Fixed Income Markets
revenues were $3.7 billion ($3.5 billion excluding CVA(4)), compared to $5.4 billion ($5.1 billion excluding CVA) in the prior quarter.  The majority of the decline was from weaker results in Credit Products and Securitized Products, which reflected a difficult market environment.  Revenues from Rates and Currencies also declined in the quarter with relative strength in Foreign Exchange offset by lower results in Rates Trading.
 
                 
Equity Markets
revenues were $652 million ($620 million excluding CVA), compared to $1.2 billion ($1.2 billion excluding CVA) in the prior quarter.  The 49% decline in revenues excluding CVA was driven by lower results in Derivatives, reflecting lower market and client volumes, and increased volatility.
 
                 
Investment banking
revenues were $674 million, down $383 million, or 36%, from the prior quarter, as client market activity levels were lower.  Debt underwriting revenues of $429 million were down 32%, and equity underwriting revenues of $157 million were down 30%, reflecting lower overall issuance volumes.  Advisory revenues were $88 million, down 56%, due to fewer completed deals, as a number of anticipated closings were moved out of the current quarter.
 
(4)  See Appendix A for quarterly CVA amounts.
                 
Private Bank
revenues were $512 million, up $18 million, or 4%, sequentially, driven by deposit repricing.
 
                 
Lending
revenues were $522 million, more than double the $243 million from the first quarter of 2010.  The revenue improvement was primarily due to gains on credit default swap hedges, compared to losses in the prior quarter.

Special Asset Pool
revenues declined $968 million sequentially to $572 million, driven by lower positive net revenue marks as gains in sub-prime related direct exposures were partially offset by a lower positive Monoline CVA (see Appendix A).  Additionally, in response to recent changes to SFAS 133, Citi reclassified $11.4 billion of securities (including $4.1 billion of Auction Rate Securities) in the from held-to-maturity to fair value at the end of the quarter.

Special Asset Pool
 
                 
Local Consumer Lending
revenues were $4.2 billion, down $464 million, or 10%, sequentially, driven by the addition of $347 million of mortgage repurchase reserves related to North America residential real estate, lower volumes in cards, and the absence of Primerica.
 
                 
Brokerage and Asset Management

Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based upon a review by Citigroup's Risk officers.  Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for Consumer loans. Consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due, and are charged off at 120 days past due. Residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency.  As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans.
