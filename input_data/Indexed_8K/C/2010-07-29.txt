Item 8.01.  Other Events.
On July 29, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Citigroup Inc. (Citigroup) announced that Citigroup has reached a settlement with the SEC regarding certain 2007 disclosures made by Citigroup about its subprime exposure.
The settlement relates to allegations by the SEC that Citigroup's disclosures about its subprime exposure in the second and third quarters of 2007 were misleading because they failed to set out the extent of Citigroup's net subprime-related exposure to so-called "super-senior" tranches of CDOs and related positions known as liquidity puts.
Pursuant to the settlement, Citigroup, without admitting or denying liability, has consented to the filing of an SEC complaint charging Citigroup with violating Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and related regulations, and to the entry of an injunction prohibiting future violations of these provisions.  Citigroup is not being charged with intentional or reckless misconduct.  The settlement is subject to approval of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
Citigroup has agreed to pay a $75 million penalty as part of the settlement.  All of the penalty will be paid into a "Fair Fund," to be used as compensation for injured investors, if any, and will offset any potential judgments or settlements in related civil litigations, if necessary.
Citigroup's former CFO, Gary Crittenden, and its former head of Investor Relations, Arthur Tildesley, also agreed to settlements with the SEC, without admitting or denying liability.  Mr. Crittenden is no longer with Citigroup.  Mr. Tildesley remains with Citigroup in a different position.  Like Citigroup, neither Mr. Crittenden nor Mr. Tildesley is being charged with intentional or reckless misconduct.  The individual settlements are part of administrative proceedings, and are not subject to court approval.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
