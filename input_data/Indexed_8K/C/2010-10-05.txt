 Covenants of the Selling Securityholder
     7.. Each Underwriter covenants with the Company not to take any action that would result in the Company being required to file with the Commission under Rule 433(d) a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of such Underwriter that otherwise would not be required to be filed by the Company thereunder, but for the action of the Underwriter.
 Covenants of the Underwriters
     8.(a) Each of the Trust and the Company jointly and severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees, agents of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to such
 Indemnity and Contribution.
 
Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter by the Representatives expressly for use therein.
     (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Company, the Trust, the Company's directors, the Company's officers and the Regular Trustees who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Trust to each Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter by the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package, any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to or , such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing, and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by such Underwriter, in the case of a party indemnified pursuant to , and by the Company, in the case of a party indemnified pursuant to . The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for
Section

Section 8(a)
Section 8(b)
 
any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in or is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Trust, on the one hand, and such Underwriter, on the other hand, from the offering of the Capital Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Trust, on the one hand, and of the relevant Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Trust, on the one hand, and such Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Capital Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Capital Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Securityholder bear to the total commissions received by such Underwriter. The relative fault of the Company and the Trust, on the one hand, and such Underwriter, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Trust or by such Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

Section 8(d)(i)
     (e) The Company, the Trust and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in . The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this ,

each Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Capital Securities sold by it were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.

Exhibit 99.1
                    Re:
Registration Statement on Form S-3
Ladies and Gentlemen:
               We have acted as special counsel to Citigroup Capital XIII, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Trust"), and Citigroup Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the public offering by the United States Department of the Treasury of 89,840,000 of the Trust's 7.875% fixed rate/floating rate trust preferred securities (liquidation amount $25 per trust preferred security) (the "Capital Securities"). The assets of the Trust consist of $2,246,025,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due October 30, 2040 (the "Junior Subordinated Debt Securities") of the Company.
               This opinion is being furnished to you in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(8) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act").
               In rendering the opinions set forth herein, we have examined and relied on originals or copies of the following:
               (a) the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-157459) of the Company, the Trust and certain other trusts relating to the Capital Securities filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, allowing for delayed offerings pursuant to Rule 415 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act (the "Rules and Regulations"), and Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 thereto, filed with the Commission on February 19, 2010;
 
Citigroup Inc. Citigroup Capital XIII October 5, 2010
               (b) the final prospectus, dated September 30, 2010, relating to the Capital Securities and the Junior Subordinated Debt Securities in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Rules and Regulations (such final prospectus being hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus"); and
               (c) such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein.
               We have also relied upon statements and representations made to us by representatives of the Company and the Trust and have assumed that such statements and the facts set forth in such representations are true, correct and complete without regard to any qualification as to knowledge or belief. Our opinion is conditioned upon the initial and continuing accuracy of the documents, certificates, records, statements and representations referred to above. We have also assumed that the transactions related to the offering of the Capital Securities will be consummated in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus.
               For purposes of our opinion, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, electronic, or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. In making our examination of documents executed, or to be executed, by the parties indicated therein, we have assumed that each party has, or will have, the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder, and we have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by each party indicated in the documents and that such documents constitute, or will constitute, valid and binding obligations of each party.
               Our opinion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, pertinent judicial authorities, interpretive rulings of the Internal Revenue Service and such other authorities as we have considered relevant, all as in effect as of the date of this opinion and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. A change in the authorities or the accuracy or completeness of any of the information, documents, certificates, records, statements, representations or assumptions on which our opinion is based could affect the conclusions expressed herein. There can be no assurance, moreover, that the opinion expressed herein will be accepted by the Internal Revenue Service or, if challenged, by a court.
               Based upon the foregoing and in reliance thereon, and subject to the qualifications, exceptions, assumptions and limitations contained herein or in the Prospectus, we are of the opinion that, under current United States federal income tax law:
 
Citigroup Inc. Citigroup Capital XIII October 5, 2010
               Except as set forth above, we express no opinion to any party as to any tax consequences, whether federal, state, local or foreign, of the Capital Securities or of any transaction related thereto. This opinion is expressed as of the date of effectiveness of the Registration Statement, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to such date or the impact of any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue. We hereby consent to the use of our name under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus and the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit 8.1 to the Registration Statement. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the Rules and Regulations promulgated thereunder.
