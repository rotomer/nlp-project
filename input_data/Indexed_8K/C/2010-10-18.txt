Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
New York, October 18, 2010  Citigroup Inc. today reported third quarter 2010 net income of $2.2 billion or $0.07 per diluted share, marking its third consecutive quarterly operating profit. Citigroup income from continuing operations, which excludes an $800 million pre-tax ($435 million after-tax) loss on the previously-announced sale of The Student Loan Corporation ("SLC"), was $2.6 billion or $0.08 per diluted share in the third quarter 2010.  In the first nine months of 2010, Citigroup earned $9.3 billion of net income and $9.6 billion of income from continuing operations.
 
(1)  Third quarter 2009 included a net negative impact of $0.18 per share due to Citi's completion of its exchange offers. Pursuant to the exchange offers, Citi generally exchanged preferred stock and certain preferred securities for common stock.  The completion of the exchange offers resulted in an $851 million after-tax gain, and a $3.1 billion reduction in income available to common shareholders.  The $0.18 loss per share from the impact of the exchange offers was defined as (Gain on Extinguishment of Debt + Impact of Exchange Offers on Retained Earnings)/Average Common Shares Outstanding = ($851 million + $(3,055) million)/12.1 billion average shares = $(0.18).
(2)  Excludes a net loss from discontinued operations of $374 million, primarily related to the previously-announced sale of The Student Loan Corporation, currently expected to close in the fourth quarter 2010.
(3)  Tangible Book Value per Share is a non-GAAP financial measure.  See Appendix B for additional information on this metric.
 
"Achieving our third straight quarter of positive operating earnings is continued evidence that we are successfully executing our strategy and we believe we have put in place all the elements for continued profitability.  We remain completely focused on serving our clients with excellence and capturing the growth potential inherent in the core businesses within Citicorp, while reducing the size of Citi Holdings as quickly as economically practical," said Vikram Pandit, Chief Executive Officer of Citi.
 
Net income was down $529 million, or 20%, from the second quarter 2010, mainly driven by the loss on the previously-announced sale of SLC, as well as Securities and Banking, which declined 17%.  Regional Consumer Banking net income of $1.2 billion increased 5% from the prior quarter, driven by Latin America and North America.  In addition, Transaction Services net income of $920 million was down 1% from the prior quarter, reflecting consistent strength in the business, despite a low rate environment, and continued investments, as growth in Latin America and Asia was offset by declines in North America and EMEA.
 
Third quarter 2010 revenues of $20.7 billion declined $1.3 billion, or 6%, from the second quarter 2010, primarily driven by Local Consumer Lending and Securities and Banking.  Citicorp Latin America and Asia revenues were up 7% and 1%, respectively, from the prior quarter, while North America and EMEA revenues declined 6% and 2%, respectively.
 
Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims declined $746 million sequentially to $5.9 billion, the lowest level since the second quarter of 2007,(4) reflecting continued improvement in credit quality.
 
Expenses of $11.5 billion decreased $346 million, or 3%, from the prior quarter.  Excluding the impact of the U.K. bonus tax in the second quarter 2010, expenses increased $58 million, or 1%, reflecting continued investment spending in Citicorp, partially offset by lower Citi Holdings expenses.
 
During the quarter, Citi continued to focus on growing its core businesses in Citicorp, while divesting assets in Citi Holdings in an economically rational manner.  Expressed on a pro forma basis for the previously-announced sale of SLC, Citi Holdings represented 20% of Citi's assets at the end of the third quarter 2010, as compared to 38% in the first quarter 2008.
 
Citi remained one of the best capitalized banks with $125.4 billion of Tier 1 Capital and a Tier 1 Common ratio of 10.3% at the end of the third quarter 2010.  In addition, it had common equity of $162.6 billion and $43.7 billion of allowance for loan losses.
 
"Overall, I am very pleased with the progress we are making as our team executes our strategy.  Our unique footprint and strong presence in the emerging markets have us well aligned for the growth trends we see globally, and we continue to make investments in our franchise so we can serve our clients at the highest level all over the world," concluded Mr. Pandit.
 
(4)  As previously disclosed, effective January 1, 2010, Citigroup adopted SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS 166) and SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (SFAS 167).  As a result, reported and managed basis presentations are equivalent for periods beginning January 1, 2010.  For comparison purposes throughout this release, revenues, net credit losses, and provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims for periods prior to January 1, 2010 are presented on a managed basis.   For additional information, see Citigroup's Third Quarter 2010 Quarterly Financial Data Supplement furnished as an exhibit to Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on October 18, 2010.

Citi Holdings
assets declined $44 billion sequentially, or 9%, to $421 billion and were down $406 billion, or 49%, from the first quarter 2008.  Citi Holdings assets comprised 21% of total Citigroup assets at the end of the third quarter 2010, down from 38% in the first quarter of 2008. Expressed on a pro forma basis for the previously-announced sale of SLC, Citi Holdings assets would have declined $75 billion, or 16%, from the prior quarter to $390 billion, and would have comprised 20% of total Citigroup assets at the end of the third quarter 2010.
 
                 
Citigroup deposits
were $850 billion, up 4% sequentially, driven by growth in international deposits.
 
                 
Citigroup's net interest margin
was 3.07%, down from 3.15% in the second quarter 2010, mainly reflecting lower investment yields as the liquidity position is maintained.

Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based upon a review by Citigroup's Risk officers.  Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for Consumer loans. Consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due, and are charged off at 120 days past due. Residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency.  As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans.
