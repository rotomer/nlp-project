Purchased Shares
          This Underwriting Terms Agreement is entered into in accordance with Section 2(c) of the Distribution Agreement applicable to a Principal Purchase or similar transaction in which the Selling Stockholder agrees to sell the Shares directly to the Manager as principal. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned thereto in the Distribution Agreement, and the terms "Underwriting Terms Agreement" and "Terms Agreement" shall be used interchangeably to refer to this agreement.
          Solely in connection with the offer and sale of the Purchased Shares, each provision of the Distribution Agreement is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and shall be deemed to be part of this Underwriting Terms Agreement to the same extent as if such provision had been set forth in full herein; provided, however, that none of the Underwriters shall have any rights or obligations under the Distribution Agreement or in connection with any transactions executed thereunder prior to the date of this Underwriting Terms Agreement, except for the Representative in its capacity as Manger under the Distribution Agreement.
          Except for the representation in Section 1(a)(v)(B)(3) of the Distribution Agreement, each of the representations and warranties set forth therein shall be deemed to have been made at and as of the date of this Underwriting Terms Agreement and at the
 
related Settlement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing two sentences, for purposes of this Underwriting Terms Agreement, references to the Manager in any provision of the Distribution Agreement will be deemed to refer to the several Underwriters, except with respect to the specific provisions of the Distribution Agreement listed on Schedule II hereto. With respect to the documents required to be delivered to the Underwriters pursuant to Section 4(b), (c) and (d) of the Distribution Agreement, such delivery date shall be the relevant Settlement Date only for purposes of this Underwriting Terms Agreement.
          A preliminary supplement and a final supplement to the Basic Prospectus relating to the Purchased Shares (the "" and the "," respectively), in the form heretofore delivered to the Representative shall be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If the Preliminary Supplement is being used to solicit offers to buy the Purchased Shares, the term "General Disclosure Package" defined in Section 1(a)(iii) of the Distribution Agreement shall be deemed to include, as of the relevant Time of Sale, the Prospectus (as amended and supplemented at such Time of Sale), the Preliminary Supplement (as amended at such Time of Sale) and any Permitted Free Writing Prospectus then in use, considered together, and any use of the term "Prospectus Supplement" or "Prospectus" in the Distribution Agreement (except when used in the definition of "General Disclosure Package" as defined above) shall be deemed to include the Final Supplement, each for purposes of this Underwriting Terms Agreement.
Preliminary Supplement
Final Supplement
     Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Distribution Agreement (except for the representation in Section 1(a)(v)(B)(3) of the Distribution Agreement), which are incorporated herein by reference, (a) the Selling Stockholder agrees to sell to the Underwriters and the Underwriters agree to purchase from the Selling Stockholder, severally and not jointly, the number of shares of the Purchased Shares set forth opposite their respective names at the time and place and at the purchase price set forth in the Schedule I hereto, which shall also be the price to the public of the Purchased Shares, and (b) the Company agrees that on the Settlement Date it shall pay $42,304,633 to the Representative for the accounts of the Underwriters, by wire transfer payable in same-day funds to an account specified by the Representative, as compensation for their services performed hereunder, representing $0.0175 per Purchased Share. Any obligation of an Underwriter to purchase the Purchased Shares from the Selling Stockholder shall also be subject to the payment by the Company of the fee described in clause (b) of the preceding sentence.
     It is understood that the Representative, acting individually and not in a representative capacity, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment to the Selling Stockholder on behalf of any other Underwriter for Purchased Shares to be purchased by such Underwriter. Any such payment by the Representative shall not relieve any such Underwriter of any of its obligations under this Underwriting Terms Agreement. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Purchased Securities to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters pursuant to this Underwriting Terms Agreement and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in
 
the performance of its or their obligations under this Underwriting Terms Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Purchased Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Purchased Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Purchased Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Purchased Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Purchased Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Purchased Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Purchased Securities, this Underwriting Terms Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter, the Selling Stockholder or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set in this paragraph, the Settlement Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Selling Stockholder, Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
          Each Underwriter agrees that it will comply with the additional selling restrictions as set forth in Schedule III hereof.
 
          If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us a counterpart hereof, whereupon this Underwriting Terms Agreement, including those provisions of the Distribution Agreement incorporated herein by reference, as amended hereby, shall constitute a binding agreement among the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters.
