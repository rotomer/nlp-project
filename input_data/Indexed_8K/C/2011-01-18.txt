Exhibit 99.1
 
New York, January 18, 2011  Citigroup Inc. today reported fourth quarter 2010 net income of $1.3 billion, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $7.6 billion, or $0.33 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2009. Citigroup net income for full year 2010 was $10.6 billion, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.6 billion, or $0.80 per share, in the full year 2009.
 
Citigroup revenues in the fourth quarter 2010 were $18.4 billion and included negative CVA of $1.1 billion.  Excluding CVA, revenues of $19.5 billion were down 6% from the prior quarter, principally driven by lower revenues and lower gains on sale of AFS securities in Corporate/Other.
Securities and Banking
 
Citicorp's net income remained strong in 2010 at $14.9 billion while Citi Holdings net loss decreased 52%, from $8.9 billion to $4.2 billion, when compared to 2009.  Citi Holdings' assets stood at $359 billion at the end of 2010, down from $487 billion at the end of 2009.  This performance helped Citi to continue to improve its capital strength, as its Tier 1 Common ratio increased from 9.6% to 10.7% over the course of the year.
 
"2010 was a year full of milestones and was critical for the turnaround of this institution," said Vikram Pandit, Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup.  "Our goal was to achieve consistent profitability and I am very pleased that with our fourth consecutive profitable quarter, we earned $10.6 billion for the year.
 
"Our core businesses in Citicorp, with its deep roots in both the developed and emerging markets, performed well throughout the year while we made targeted investments in talent and technology.  At the same time, we continued to wind down Citi Holdings in an economically rational manner, reducing assets by $128 billion in 2010 alone. Holdings' total assets have declined by more than half from their peak in 2008 to $359 billion and now
stand at less than 20% of our balance sheet."
 
"We have the right strategy for our company's present and future and are executing it with discipline.  Although the economic environment remains uncertain, our future path is clear:  As America's global bank, we've built a foundation capable of producing sustained profitability and our next goal is to achieve responsible growth," concluded Mr. Pandit.

Citi Holdings assets
were $359 billion at December 31, 2010, down $62 billion, or 15%, from September 30, 2010.

Local Consumer Lending revenues

As previously disclosed, effective January 1, 2010, Citigroup adopted SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS 166) and SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (SFAS 167).  As a result, reported and managed basis presentations are equivalent for periods beginning January 1, 2010. For comparison purposes throughout this supplement, revenues, net credit losses, provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims, and loans (and all related delinquencies and ratios) for periods prior to January 1, 2010 are presented on a managed basis. Managed presentations were applicable only to C itigroup's North America branded and retail partner card operations in North America Regional Consumer Banking and Citi Holdings Local Consumer Lending.  Prior to January 1, 2010, managed-basis presentations were non-GAAP financial measures.  Managed presentations included results from both the on-balance sheet loans and off-balance sheet loans, and excluded the impact of card securitization activity. Managed presentations assumed that securitized loans had not been sold and presented the results of the securitized loans in the same manner as Citigroup's owned loans. See pages 43 - 46 for reconciliations of managed measures to their most comparable GAAP measure.
