Exhibit 99.1
 
 
New York, April 18, 2011  Citigroup Inc. today reported first quarter 2011 net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.10 per diluted share.  Net income declined $1.4 billion from the first quarter 2010, but more than doubled sequentially.
 
"After a full year of profitability, we continue to make progress in 2011 by executing our strategy with discipline. Citi Holdings losses continued to decrease; we are investing in our core businesses in Citicorp; our capital strength improved; and the mix of revenues reflects the diversity of our businesses and our depth in both the emerging and developed markets," said Vikram Pandit, Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup.
 
Citigroup revenues in the first quarter 2011 were $19.7 billion, up 7% sequentially, but down 22% from the first quarter 2010.  Citicorp revenues of $16.5 billion were 16% higher sequentially, but 11% lower than the prior year period.  The year over year decline was mainly driven by lower revenues in Fixed Income Markets and North America , as well as negative CVA.
Regional Consumer Banking
 
Credit continued to improve during the quarter, as Citigroup net credit losses declined for the seventh consecutive quarter to $6.3 billion.  In addition, the current quarter included a net $3.3 billion release of allowance for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments.
 
Citi Holdings' assets were $337 billion at the end of the first quarter 2011, down $166 billion from the first quarter 2010. Citi Holdings revenues of $3.3 billion were 50% lower than the prior year period, reflecting the continued decline in assets and the revenue impact of a $12.7 billion asset transfer from held-to-maturity ("HTM") to trading.
 
In the first quarter 2011, Citigroup transferred $12.7 billion of assets in the in Citi Holdings from HTM to trading.  This transfer permits the sale of those assets, which have disproportionately higher risk-weightings under Basel III. The transfer resulted in a net $709 million pre-tax charge to revenues, from the recognition of $1.7 billion in pre-tax losses ($1.0 after-tax) which were previously reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), partially offset by $946 million of mark-to-market and realized gains on those assets.

"As America's global bank, we are focused on supporting the real economy and creating opportunities for our clients to succeed.  Our sustained profitability has put us in a good position to accomplish our next goal of responsible growth," concluded Mr. Pandit.
