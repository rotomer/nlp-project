Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am an Associate General CounselCapital Markets and Corporate Reporting of Citigroup Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Guarantor) and the parent company of Citigroup Funding Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company).  I refer to the offering of $8,004,000.00 Index Linked Notes Based on the Value of the S&P 500 Index Due May 9, 2016 (MTNDG0036) of the Company (the Securities) (and the guarantee of the Guarantor (the Guarantee) in respect of the Securities) pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Nos. 333-157386 and 333-157386-01) (the Registration Statement) and the pricing supplement dated May 4, 2011 and the prospectus supplement and prospectus, each dated February 11, 2011 (collectively, the Prospectus).  The Securities were issued pursuant to the senior debt indenture dated as of June 1, 2005 (as amended, the Indenture), among the Company, the Guarantor and The Bank of New York Mellon, as successor trustee (the Trustee).
I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for the purposes of this opinion.  In such examination, I have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the original of such copies.
Upon the basis of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that the Securities and the Guarantee are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company and the Guarantor, respectively, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally from time to time in effect and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

I consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.01 to the Guarantors Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 9, 2011.  In giving such consent, I do not thereby admit that I come within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.
