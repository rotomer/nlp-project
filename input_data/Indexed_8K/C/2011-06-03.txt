The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time outstanding affected thereby, on behalf of all of the Holders of the Securities of such series, to waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the Indenture with respect to such series, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of such series.

During any such Extended Interest Payment Period, and during any other period when a Default shall have occurred and be continuing or the Securities are held by a Citigroup Trust and the Company shall be in default relating to its payment of any obligation under the Guarantee Agreement or another guarantee agreement relating to the beneficial interest in such Citigroup Trust (if other than Citigroup XXXII), (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment

The foregoing, however, will not apply to any stock "dividends" paid by the Company where the dividend stock is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid. Before the termination of any such Extended Interest Payment Period, the Company may further extend such Extended Interest Payment Period, that such Extended Interest Payment Period together with all such further extensions thereof shall not exceed 20 consecutive quarters and such Extended Interest Payment Period does not end on a date other than an Interest Payment Date. At the termination of any such Extended Interest Payment Period and upon the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest and any additional amounts then due, the Company may commence a new Extended Interest Payment Period.
