Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
New York, October 17, 2011  Citigroup Inc. today reported net income of $3.8 billion, or $1.23 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2011, which was 74% higher than the prior year period and 13% above the second quarter 2011.  Third quarter revenues of $20.8 billion increased slightly from the prior year period and the second quarter 2011.
 
Third quarter revenues included $1.9 billion of credit valuation adjustment (CVA) reflecting the widening of Citi's credit spreads during the third quarter.  Excluding CVA, third quarter 2011 revenues were $18.9 billion, 8% below the prior year period and 8% below the second quarter 2011.  CVA increased reported third quarter earnings by $0.39 per share.
 
Vikram Pandit, Citi's Chief Executive Officer, said, "Citi continues to navigate a challenging economic environment and delivered another quarter of solid operating results. We continued to manage our risk prudently while growing the businesses that are core to our strategy. We have reduced the size of Citi Holdings to 15% of our balance sheet and further improved our financial strength.  We are very well positioned as we help our clients navigate the world's current trends and key opportunities."
 
"In addition, over the past few years we have significantly strengthened our retail partner cards business and it has earned $2.2 billion pre-tax through the first three quarters.  After a careful review of the business, which took into account current trends in credit and technology, we have decided that it makes strategic sense to move retail partner cards and a vast majority of its assets from Citi Holdings into Citicorp. The transition will be completed by the end of this year."

The year-over-year decline in Citigroup revenues, excluding CVA, was driven by lower revenues in both Citicorp and Citi Holdings.  Citicorp revenues, excluding CVA, were down 2% from the prior year period largely due to lower revenues in that more than offset higher revenues in , while Citi Holdings revenues declined 27% from the prior year period largely from the impact of a 31% decline in Citi Holdings assets from the third quarter 2010.

Citicorp revenues
of $17.7 billion in the third quarter 2011 included $1.9 billion of CVA.  Excluding the CVA, Citicorp revenues of $15.8 billion were 2% lower than the third quarter 2010.  The decline was largely due to lower revenues in , which were 12% below the prior year period and more than offset 2% growth in revenues and 7% growth in revenues from the prior year period.

Citi Holdings revenues
of $2.8 billion were 27% below the prior year period.  The decline in CitiHoldings revenues was principally due to the continuing reduction in assets, which fell $132 billion, or 31%, from the prior year period.  Citi Holdings assets of $289 billion at the end of the third quarter 2011 represented approximately 15% of total Citigroup assets.

revenues
of $3.4 billion were 9% lower than the prior year period.  The decline in revenues was principally caused by lower average card balances, the impact on card yields of the look-back provisions of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act and lower gains on sale in mortgages.

grew 20% year-over-year to $6.7 billion.  Third quarter 2011 results included $1.9 billion of positive CVA from a widening of Citi's credit spreads.  Excluding the impact of CVA, revenues in the third quarter were $4.8 billion, down 12% from the prior year period.  The ongoing challenging macro environment negatively affected investor sentiment, client activity and trading, leading to lower results in Fixed Income Markets, Equities and Investment Banking during the quarter that more than offset increased revenues in Lending.

Citigroup's net income
increased 74% to $3.8 billion, compared to the third quarter 2010, reflecting the impact of CVA and a $2.6 billion improvement in the cost of credit, which was partially offset by an 8%, or $940 million, increase in operating expenses from the prior year period.  Total cost of credit during the quarter fell 43% to $3.4 billion.  The improvement in credit costs was driven by a 41% decline in net credit losses to $4.5 billion and a $1.4 billion release of credit reserves, reflecting a lower level of inherent losses remaining in the portfolio.  Operating expenses increased 8% from the prior year period to $12.5 billion, reflecting higher expenses from the impact of foreign exchange translation, higher legal and related expenses and ongoing investment spending, which were partially offset by ongoing reengineering benefits and lower expenses in Citi Holdings and .

Citigroup's total allowance for loan losses
was $32.1 billion at quarter end, or 5.1% of total loans.  The $1.4 billion net release of credit reserves in the quarter was down 28% from the prior year period as higher reserve releases in Citicorp were offset by lower releases in Citi Holdings.  Credit reserve releases in Citicorp of $585 million were $159 million higher than the prior year period as additional credit reserve releases in , largely related to Citi-branded cards, were offset by lower credit reserve releases from international.  Citi Holdings credit reserve releases fell $703 million to $838 million as releases in decreased, largely due to lower releases in the retail partner cards portfolio, and lower releases in the where total loan levels continue to decline.  Citigroup asset quality continued to improve as total non-accrual assets fell 44% to $13.5 billion from third quarter 2010.  Corporate non-accrual loans fell 58%

in the third quarter 2011 fell 47% from the prior year period to $1.4 billion.  The decline was largely driven by a $1.1 billion decline in net credit losses to $1.9 billion and a $159 million increase in the release of credit reserves to $585 million.  The substantial majority of the reserve release was attributed to consumer loans, largely Citi-branded cards, as credit quality across the consumer portfolio continued to improve.

declined 9% versus the prior year period to $3.4 billion.  The decline reflected lower revenues in mortgages and cards, partially offset by improved results in banking.  Lower origination volumes and gains on sale drove the decline in mortgage revenues.  Cards revenues declined due to a 4% decline in average cards receivables to $73 billion and lower average yields largely attributed to the impact of the look-back provisions of the CARD Act.  Banking revenues increased from the prior year period as average loans grew 19% to $35 billion with most of the growth coming from mortgages.

The growth in net income was driven by the release of credit reserves and lower net credit losses in the third quarter that was partially offset by a 24% year-over-year growth in operating expenses to $1.8 billion, mostly due to ongoing investment spending in marketing and technology.

credit quality

continued to improve as net credit losses fell $815 million, or 41%, to $1.2 billion compared to the prior year period.  Net credit losses improved in both Citi-branded cards and retail banking.  Delinquencies in both cards and retail banking also improved across virtually all buckets versus the prior year period.  The total credit reserve release in the third quarter was $653 million, compared to a build of $40 million in the third quarter 2010.   The third quarter 2011 reserve release was driven by Citi-branded cards.
 
International revenues

grew across all regions versus the prior year period with Asia revenues growing 13%, Latin America 9% and EMEA 5%.  Latin America and Asia each saw double digit growth year-over-year in average loans, average deposits and purchase sales.
 
International net income
RCB
fell 12% from the prior year period to $919 million due to a smaller net credit reserve release of $9 million in the third quarter 2011 compared to a net release of $440 million in the prior year period, combined with a 12% increase in operating expenses to $2.9 billion.  The higher expenses reflected ongoing investments, the impact of foreign exchange translation and higher business volumes, partially offset by productivity gains.
 
International credit quality
RCB
improved from the prior year period as net credit losses fell 9% to $691 million.  Total reserves released in the third quarter were $9 million, down from $440 million in the third quarter 2010, as reserve releases declined in EMEA and Asia, but Latin America had a reserve build of $63 million in the quarter.  Overall credit quality in international continued to improve as delinquencies in both cards and retail banking were lower across all buckets even as the underlying loan portfolios grew at double digit rates versus the third quarter 2010.

revenues
grew 20% from the prior year period to $6.7 billion due to the $1.9 billion of CVA recorded in the quarter.  Excluding CVA, revenues were down 12% to $4.8 billion reflecting lower results in Fixed Income Markets, Equities and Investment Banking, partially offset by increased revenues in Lending.
Securities and Banking
 
Fixed Income revenues
of $3.8 billion in the third quarter 2011 included $1.5 billion of CVA.  Excluding CVA, Fixed Income revenues were $2.3 billion, 33% below the prior year period. The third quarter was dominated by significant macroeconomic concerns including the U.S. debt ceiling debate and subsequent downgrade of U.S. sovereign credit, the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe and general concerns about the health of the global economy.  Market fears led to a broad widening of credit spreads and heightened volatility combined with declining liquidity in many markets as many participants stayed on the sidelines.  Despite generally stable client revenues in the quarter, trading results were adversely affected by the difficult operating environment.  The decline in Fixed Income revenues from the prior year period was largely driven by significantly lower results in Credit Products and Securitized Products that were partially offset by revenue growth in Rates and Currencies and Commodities versus the prior year period.
 
Equity Markets revenues
of $634 million in the third quarter included $345 million of CVA.  Excluding CVA, Equity revenues fell 73% year-over-year to $289 million.  While revenues in Cash Equities and Prime Finance were relatively unchanged from the prior year period, the difficult market conditions in the third quarter drove significant declines in Derivatives and Principal Strategies revenues, which were largely responsible for the year-over-year decline in Equities Markets revenues.
Investment Banking revenues
declined 21% from the prior year period to $736 million as revenues in Advisory, Debt Underwriting and Equity Underwriting all fell.  The decline in revenues was driven by lower volumes in mergers and acquisitions and debt and equity issuance globally, reflecting the difficult and uncertain market conditions.
Lending revenues
were $1.0 billion in the third quarter, up from ($11) million in the prior year period, largely from gains on hedges as credit spreads widened during the quarter.

Citi Holdings revenues
decreased 27% from the prior year period to $2.8 billion as assets declined 31% to $289 billion.  Lower revenues in and the drove the lower results in Citi Holdings.  revenues of $3.0 billion fell 15% from the prior year period primarily due to the 22% decline in end of period loans to $187 billion.  revenues fell $541 million from the prior year period to ($227) million, primarily due to lower net interest revenue.  The decline in net interest revenue reflects the decrease in interest earning assets as total assets declined 53% year-over-year.  revenues were $55 million, compared to ($8) million in the prior year period, largely reflecting the absence of mark downs on private equity investments in the prior year period.  The equity contribution from the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture was essentially unchanged versus the prior year period.

Citi Holdings cost of credit
decreased by $1.3 billion, or 40%, year-over-year to $2.0 billion, driven by a 44% reduction in net credit losses to $2.6 billion, partially offset by a 46% reduction in the credit reserve release to $838 million.  Credit improved in with net credit losses declining 40% from the prior year period to $2.4 billion, partially offset by a 41% decrease in the credit reserve release to $558 million.
