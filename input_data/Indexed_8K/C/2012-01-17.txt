Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
New York, January 17, 2012  Citigroup Inc. today reported net income of $1.2 billion, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2011 on revenues of $17.2 billion. This compared to net income of $1.3 billion, or $0.43 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter 2010 on revenues of $18.4 billion.
 
Citigroup 2011 full year net income was $11.3 billion on revenues of $78.4 billion, compared to net income of $10.6 billion on revenues of $86.6 billion for the full year 2010.
 
Vikram Pandit, Citi's Chief Executive Officer, said, "Overall, we made solid progress in 2011. We increased our net income to $11.3 billion, up 6% from the previous year, and reached key benchmarks in our consumer businesses, showing our strategy is achieving results. Clearly, the macro environment has impacted the capital markets and we will continue to right-size our businesses to match the environment. With Citi Holdings assets at

12% after the transfer of retail partner cards to Citicorp, we are increasingly focused on driving earnings through our core franchise and beginning to return capital to our shareholders this year."
 
The majority of the revenue decline in 2011 was driven by the ongoing reduction in Citi Holdings assets, which declined approximately $90 billion during the year to $269 billion.  Citi Holdings 2011 revenues declined 33%, or $6.4 billion, to $12.9 billion.  Citicorp revenues for 2011 were $64.6 billion, down 2%, or $1.0 billion, from 2010 as revenue growth in and was offset by declines in revenues.

Fourth quarter revenues included $(40) million for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) and debt valuation adjustment (DVA), as credit spreads tightened during the quarter(3).  CVA/DVA in the third quarter 2011 was $1.9 billion and in the fourth quarter 2010 was $(1.1) billion.  Full year CVA/DVA in 2011 was $1.8 billion compared to $(469) million in 2010.  Excluding CVA/DVA, Citigroup fourth quarter 2011 revenues were $17.2 billion, down 12% as compared to the prior year period, and full year 2011 revenues were $76.5 billion, also a 12% decline from full year 2010.
 
Citicorp revenues
of $14.0 billion in the fourth quarter 2011 included $(74) million of CVA/DVA compared to $(1.0) billion in the prior year period.  Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp revenues of $14.1 billion were 8% below the fourth quarter 2010.  The decline was largely due to lower revenues in , which, excluding CVA/DVA, were 29% below the prior year period and more than offset a 1% growth in revenues and 2% growth in revenues from the prior year period.

Citi Holdings revenues
of $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter 2011 were 30% below the prior year period.  The decline in CitiHoldings revenues was principally due to the continuing reduction in assets, which decreased $90 billion, or 25%, from the end of 2010.  Citi Holdings assets of $269 billion at the end of the fourth quarter 2011 included approximately $45 billion related to Citi's retail partner cards business which, as previously announced, Citi intends to transfer into Citicorp during the first quarter 2012.  Citi Holdings assets at the end of the fourth quarter represented approximately 14% of total Citigroup assets, and less than 12% of Citi's total assets after reflecting the transfer of Citi retail partner cards.
 
Citigroup's net income
declined 11% from the fourth quarter 2010 to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter 2011, reflecting a $1.2 billion decline in year-over-year revenues, a $465 million increase in operating expenses and a $470 million increase in the provision for taxes, which offset a $2.0 billion improvement in the cost of credit from the prior year period.  Compared to the prior year, total cost of credit in the fourth quarter fell 41% to $2.9 billion.  The improvement in credit costs was driven by a 40% decline in net credit losses to $4.1 billion partially offset by a smaller release of credit reserves of $1.5 billion.  The credit reserve release reflects a lower level of inherent losses remaining in the portfolio.  Operating expenses increased 4% from the prior year period to $12.9 billion.  Fourth quarter 2011 expenses included $557 million of legal and related costs and the previously announced repositioning charge of $428 million.  Additionally, as previously announced, the $470 million increase in the provision for taxes includes a tax charge of $300 million due to a write-down in the value of Japanese deferred tax assets reflecting legislation in Japan that decreased the corporate income tax rate. Citigroup's effective tax rate for the full year 2011 was 24.1%.
 
Citigroup's total allowance for loan losses
was $30.1 billion at quarter end, or 4.7% of total loans.  The $1.5 billion net release of credit reserves in the quarter was down 35% from the prior year period.  Credit reserve releases in Citicorp of $699 million were $42 million lower than the prior year period as additional credit reserve releases in , largely related to Citi-branded cards, were offset by credit reserve builds in international(Asia, Latin America and EMEA).  Citi Holdings credit reserve releases fell $743 million to $767 million as releases in decreased, largely due to lower releases in the retail partner cards portfolio and lower releases in the where total loan levels and charge-offs declined.  Citigroup asset quality continued to improve as total non-accrual assets fell 44% to $11.8 billion from fourth quarter 2010.  Corporate non-accrual loans fell 62% to $3.2 billion and consumer non-accrual loans fell 26% to $8.0 billion.  Consumer loans that were 90+ days delinquent, excluding , fell 30% versus the prior year period to $9.4 billion, or 2.3% of consumer loans.

Citicorp
in the fourth quarter 2011 fell 37% from the prior year period to $1.2 billion.  The decline was largely driven by a $759 million decline in net credit losses to $1.9 billion that was partially offset by a $42 million decrease in the release of credit reserves to $699 million.  The substantial majority of the reserve release was attributed to consumer loans, largely Citi-branded cards, as credit quality across the consumer portfolio continued to improve.  Citicorp's consumer loans 90+ days delinquent fell 22% from the prior year period to $2.4 billion, and the 90+ days delinquent ratio fell 27% to 0.98% of loans.
cost of credit
Citicorp
increased 8% year-over-year to $10.2 billion, largely driven by ongoing investments, repositioning charges and legal and related expenses, offset by expense savings initiatives.

Conversely, net income in international declined 16% from the prior year period to $788 million, while net income increased 64% to $661 million, largely as a result of credit reserve builds internationally and higher credit reserve releases and lower net credit losses in North America.

net income
was $661 million, up 64% from the fourth quarter 2010.

Operating expenses in the fourth quarter grew 31% from the prior year period
to $2.1 billion largely due to ongoing investment spending in marketing and technology and an increase in litigation reserves in cards.

credit quality
RCB
continued to improve as net credit losses fell $718 million, or 41%, to $1.0 billion compared to the prior year period.  Net credit losses improved in both Citi-branded cards and retail banking.  Delinquency rates in both cards and retail banking also improved across virtually all buckets versus the prior year period.  The total net credit reserve release in the fourth quarter was $681 million, $333 million higher than the net credit reserve release in the fourth quarter 2010, largely driven by Citi-branded cards.
 
International revenues
RCB
grew 2% to $4.7 billion versus the fourth quarter 2010.  Revenue growth in Latin America (3%, 9% ex-FX) and in Asia (5%, 5% ex-FX), more than offset a 12% (7% ex-FX) decline in EMEA revenues.  Latin America and Asia saw year-over-year growth in average loans, average deposits and purchase sales.
 
International net income
RCB
fell 16% from the prior year period to $788 million due to a net credit reserve build of $72 million in the fourth quarter 2011 compared to a net release of $203 million in the prior year period, and the impact of the Japan DTA write-down.  Operating expenses in the fourth quarter 2011 were essentially unchanged from the prior year period.  Absent repositioning, and legal and related charges taken in the fourth quarter 2011, international expenses declined.  As a result, overall international produced positive operating leverage in the quarter, reflecting positive operating leverage in both and .

revenues
declined 10% from the prior year period to $3.2 billion.  While the fourth quarter 2011 had $(74) million of CVA/DVA, the prior year period had CVA/DVA of $(1.0) billion.  Excluding CVA/DVA, revenues declined 29% from the prior year period, reflecting lower revenue in Fixed Income Markets, Equity Markets and Investment Banking.
Securities and Banking
 
Fixed Income revenues
of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter 2011 (excluding $(84) million of CVA/DVA) declined 25% from the prior year period.  The fourth quarter reflected ongoing market fears of the European sovereign debt crisis and its potential impact on other markets and the global economy.  Those concerns led to broad de-risking by clients and declines in client activity as well as market volumes around the world.  Citi also continued to maintain a conservative risk profile during the quarter, while remaining focused on serving the needs of its clients.  The decline in Fixed Income revenues from the prior year period largely reflected significantly lower results in credit products and securitized products that were partially offset by revenue growth in rates and currencies, especially in local emerging markets.
 
Equity Markets revenues
of $240 million in the fourth quarter 2011 included $8 million of CVA/DVA.  Excluding CVA/DVA, equity revenues fell 71% year-over-year to $232 million.  Equity market volumes declined in the fourth quarter as clients broadly reduced activity levels in the face of market uncertainty.  The difficult market conditions in the fourth quarter drove significant declines in derivatives revenues and, to a lesser degree, declines in revenues in cash equities.
 
Investment Banking revenues
declined 45% from the prior year period to $638 million as revenues in advisory, debt underwriting and equity underwriting all fell.  The decline in revenues was driven by lower volumes in
 
mergers and acquisitions and equity issuance and continued low volumes in bond underwriting globally, reflecting the continued difficult and uncertain market conditions.
 
Lending revenues
declined 15% from the prior year period to $164 million, due primarily to a loss on hedges as credit spreads narrowed during the quarter.

The decline in net interest revenue reflects the decrease in interest earning assets as total assets declined 49% year-over-year to $41 billion.  revenues were $43 million, compared to $136 million in the prior year period, largely reflecting a decline in the equity contribution from the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture.
