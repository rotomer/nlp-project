Item 2.06. Material Impairments.
 
As part of Citis ongoing capital planning efforts and in light of general improvement in equity capital markets globally, Citi plans to reduce its ownership interest in Akbank T.A.S. (Akbank) to below 10%, subject to appropriate market conditions and required approvals. Citi currently holds a 20% equity interest in Akbank, which it purchased in January 2007. The current carrying value of the equity method investment is $3.4 billion; in addition, hedging costs and translation losses reflected in other comprehensive income (OCI), a component of equity, total approximately $1.0 billion.
 
As a result of this decision, in the first quarter of 2012 Citi expects to record an impairment charge related to its total investment in Akbank amounting to approximately $1.1 billion pre-tax ($0.7 billion after-tax). This impairment charge is primarily driven by the recognition of all respective net investment foreign currency hedging and translation losses previously reflected in OCI as well as a reduction in carrying value of the total investment to reflect closing market price as of March 23, 2012.
