Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
New York, April 16, 2012  Citigroup Inc. today reported net income of $2.9 billion, or $0.95 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2012 on revenues of $19.4 billion.
 
CVA/DVA was a negative $1.3 billion during the first quarter, resulting from the tightening of Citi's credit spreads, compared to a negative $256 million in the prior year period.  First quarter results also included a net gain of $477 million from minority investments (see Corporate/Other below).  Excluding CVA/DVA and the net gain from minority investments, first quarter revenues were $20.2 billion and earnings were $1.11 per diluted share, up 1% and 7% respectively from the prior year period.
 
Vikram Pandit, Citi's Chief Executive Officer, said, "While our businesses operated in an improved environment, we also saw the benefit of our investments. We generated revenue growth and had positive operating leverage across all three of Citi's core businesses. Global Consumer Banking, our largest business, produced another quarter of good growth in revenues, net income and key drivers like loans and deposits.  Transaction Services had record quarterly revenues as it captured increasing share in global trade finance, and Securities and Banking rebounded strongly with year-over-year revenue growth excluding the impact of CVA/DVA."
 
"We continued to wind down our Citi Holdings legacy portfolio, which now stands at 11% of our total assets, while further building capital. With a Tier 1 Common Ratio of 12.4% under Basel I and an estimated Tier 1 Common Ratio of 7.2% under Basel III, we continue to be one of the best capitalized banks in the world."
"While the operating environment improved in the first quarter, there is still much macro uncertainty and we will continue to manage risk carefully. We will continue to leverage the depth and the scale of our global presence to serve our clients and grow our businesses," concluded Mr. Pandit.
 
Citigroup revenues
of $20.7 billion, excluding CVA/DVA, were up 4% from the prior year.  Excluding both CVA/DVA and the net gain on minority investments, Citigroup revenues were up 1% from the prior year period, reflecting growth in Citicorp that was partially offset by revenue declines in Citi Holdings.
 
Citicorp revenues
of $18.0 billion in the first quarter 2012 included a negative $1.4 billion of CVA/DVA.  Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp revenues were $19.4 billion, 6% higher than the first quarter 2011.  The increase reflected revenue growth in Citicorp's three businesses with revenues 5% higher, (excluding CVA/DVA) 6% higher and revenues 7%higher versus first quarter 2011.

Citi Holdings revenues
of $874 million in the first quarter 2012 were 47% below the prior year period.  Excluding CVA/DVA, Citi Holdings revenues were $786 million, 53% lower than the first quarter 2011.  Negative revenues in the and and lower revenues in drove the decline in Citi Holdings revenues.  The lower revenues also reflected the ongoing decline in assets in Citi Holdings.  Total Citi Holdings assets declined $86 billion, or 29%, from the first quarter 2011, to $209 billion. Citi Holdings assets at the end of the first quarter 2012 represented approximately 11% of total Citigroup assets.

Citigroup's net income
declined 2% from the first quarter 2011 to $2.9 billion.  Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA and the net gain on minority investments, Citigroup net income was $3.4 billion, 8% higher than the comparable first quarter 2011 results.  Operating expenses of $12.3 billion were essentially unchanged from the prior year period.  Citigroup's cost of credit in the first quarter 2012 was 5% below the prior year period, as a $2.3 billion improvement in net credit losses was largely offset by a $2.2 billion reduction in net loan loss reserve releases.
 
Citigroup's total allowance for loan losses
was $29.0 billion at quarter end, or 4.5% of total loans, compared to $36.6 billion, or 5.8%, in the prior year period.  The $1.2 billion net release of credit reserves in the quarter was down 65% from the prior year period.  Credit reserve releases in Citicorp of $588 million and in Citi Holdings of $576 million were 67% and 63% lower, respectively, than the first quarter 2011.  Citicorp's decline in credit reserve releases reflected lower releases in and a net credit reserve build primarily in international (Asia, Latin America and EMEA) and .  The decline in Citi Holdings credit reserve releases was almost entirely due to the , where credit reserve releases were $55 million in the first quarter 2012, compared to $980 million in the first quarter 2011.  Citigroup asset quality continued to improve as total non-accrual assets fell 25% to $12.3 billion compared to the first quarter 2011.  Corporate non-accrual loans fell 46% to $3.0 billion and consumer non-accrual loans fell 6% to $8.7 billion.  Consumer loans that were 90+ days delinquent, excluding the , fell 21% versus the prior year period to $9.1 billion, or 2.3% of consumer loans.

revenues
GCB
grew 5% to $5.2 billion driven by higher retail banking revenues that were partially offset by lower revenues from Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services (formerly retail partner cards).  Retail banking revenues grew 37% to $1.6 billion from the first quarter 2011 largely due to improved results in mortgages.  Citi-branded cards revenues declined 6% to $2.1 billion, and Citi retail services revenues declined 3% to $1.5 billion, both versus the prior year period.  The lower results in cards primarily reflected lower average loan balances for both businesses as Citi-branded cards loans declined 2% and Citi retail services loans declined 5% from first quarter 2011, as well as lower yields in Citi-branded cards.
 
North America GCB
net income
was $1.3 billion, 41% higher than the first quarter 2011.  The growth in net income was largely driven by higher revenues and a $743 million decrease in net credit losses that was partially
offset by a $360 million reduction in credit reserve releases versus the prior year period.  Operating expenses in the first quarter grew 3% from the prior year period to $2.3 billion largely due to ongoing investment spending in marketing partially offset by the absence of a litigation reserve taken in the prior year period.

credit quality
GCB
continued to improve as net credit losses fell $743 million, or 31%, to $1.6 billion compared to the prior year period.  Net credit losses improved in Citi-branded cards, Citi retail services and retail banking.  Delinquency rates in both cards and retail banking also generally improved across all delinquency buckets versus the prior year period.  The total net credit reserve release in the first quarter 2012 was $841 million, $360 million lower than in the first quarter 2011.
 
International revenues
GCB
grew 4% to $4.8 billion versus the first quarter 2011.  Compared to the prior year period, revenues grew 6% in Latin America to $2.4 billion and 5% in Asia to $2.0 billion, which more than offset a decline in EMEA revenues of 10% to $378 million.  Latin America and Asia saw continued year-over-year growth in average loans and average deposits during the first quarter 2012.
 
International net income
GCB
fell 12% from the prior year period to $870 million primarily due to a net credit reserve build of $106 million in the first quarter 2012 compared to a net release of $216 million in the prior year period.  While operating expenses in the first quarter 2012 grew 2% from the first quarter 2011 to $2.9 billion, international achieved year-over-year positive operating leverage for the second consecutive quarter as year-over-year revenue growth outpaced expense growth.
GCB
 
International credit quality
GCB
improved modestly from the prior year period as net credit losses fell 3% to $649 million.  The credit build of $106 million in the first quarter 2012 primarily reflected a reserve build in Latin America compared to a release of $216 million in the prior year period.  EMEA and Asia recorded small credit reserve releases in the first quarter 2012.  Overall credit quality in international improved even as loan portfolios continued to grow.  90+ days delinquency rates were generally lower across all products in all regions.

Investment Banking revenues
grew 2% from the prior year period to $865 million as growth in debt underwriting offset declines in advisory and equity underwriting revenues.  Debt underwriting revenues increased 19% to $601 million compared to the first quarter 2011, driven by volume growth in certain products and gains in market share.  Advisory revenues declined 23% to $110 million and equity underwriting revenues declined 25% to $154 million, each from the prior year period, reflecting market wide declines in activity levels in many products.
Lending revenues

Citi Holdings revenues
decreased 47% from the prior year period to $874 million.  Excluding CVA/DVA, Citi Holdings revenues were $786 million, 53% lower than the first quarter 2011.

Citi Holdings assets represented 11% of total Citigroup assets at the end of the first quarter.

Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based upon a review by Citigroup's risk officers.  Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for Consumer loans: Consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due, and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency.  As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans.
