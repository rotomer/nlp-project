Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
New York, July 16, 2012  Citigroup Inc. today reported net income for the second quarter 2012 of $2.9 billion, or $0.95 per diluted share, on revenues of $18.6 billion.
 
CVA/DVA was a positive $219 million in the second quarter, resulting from the widening of Citi's credit spreads, compared to a positive $164 million in the prior year period.  Second quarter results also included a net loss of $424 million ($274 million after-tax) from the previously announced sale of a 10.1% stake in Akbank T.A.S.  Excluding CVA/DVA and the Akbank loss, second quarter revenues were $18.8 billion and earnings were $1.00 per diluted share, down 7% and 2% respectively from the prior year period.
 
Vikram Pandit, Citi's Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our core businesses performed well in a difficult environment and are generating solid returns.  We had strong growth in both loans and deposits, showed resilience in our markets-facing businesses, and saw record revenues in Transaction Services.  We reduced Citi Holdings to approximately 10% of our balance sheet while our capital strength and liquidity continue to be among the best in the industry.  We remain focused on execution, managing our expenses and our risk, and serving clients as only we can."
 
Citigroup revenues
of $18.4 billion, excluding CVA/DVA, were 10% lower than the prior year period.  Excluding both CVA/DVA and the loss on Akbank, Citigroup revenues were 7% below the prior year period.  The decline in
 
revenues year-over-year was driven by the ongoing wind down of Citi Holdings, which reduced revenues in Citi Holdings by 62% versus the prior year period, while Citicorp revenues were essentially unchanged.
 
Citicorp revenues
of $18.0 billion in the second quarter 2012 included $198 million of CVA/DVA.  Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp revenues were $17.8 billion, unchanged from the second quarter 2011.  The results reflected a 2% decline in revenues(excluding a positive CVA/DVA of $198 million) that was offset by a 5% increase in revenues, while revenues were unchanged versus second quarter 2011.

Citi Holdings revenues
of $924 million in the second quarter 2012 were 62% below the prior year period.  Lower revenues in the and in largely drove the decline in Citi Holdings revenues from the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in revenues.  The results in the and largely reflected the ongoing decline in assets in these businesses as well as the absence of gains in the in the prior year period from the sale of securities that had been transferred from held-to-maturity and other asset sales.  Total Citi Holdings assets declined $74 billion, or 28%, from the second quarter 2011, to $191 billion. Citi Holdings assets at the end of the second quarter 2012 represented approximately 10% of total Citigroup assets.

Citigroup's net income
declined 12% from the second quarter 2011 to $2.9 billion.  Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA and the loss from the Akbank sale, Citigroup net income was $3.1 billion, 1% lower than the second quarter 2011.  Operating expenses of $12.1 billion were 6% lower than the prior year period.  Citigroup's cost of credit in the second quarter 2012 was 17% below the prior year period, reflecting a $1.6 billion improvement in net credit losses which was partially offset by a $1.0 billion reduction in net loan loss reserve releases.
 
Citigroup's total allowance for loan losses
was $27.6 billion at quarter end, or 4.3% of total loans, compared to $34.4 billion, or 5.4%, in the prior year period.  The $984 million net release of loan loss reserves in the quarter was down 50% from the prior year period.  Reserve releases in Citicorp of $715 million and in Citi Holdings of $269 million were 49% and 54% lower, respectively, than the second quarter 2011.  Citicorp's decline in loan loss reserve releases reflected lower releases in and and a net credit reserve build in international (Asia, Latin America and EMEA).  The $314 million decline in Citi Holdings loan loss reserve releases was almost entirely due to the , where reserve releases declined $317 million from the second quarter 2011 to $83 million.  Citigroup asset quality continued to improve as total non-accrual assets fell 22% to $11.5 billion compared to the second quarter 2011.  Corporate non-accrual loans fell 47% to $2.6 billion and consumer non-accrual loans fell 1% to $8.3 billion.  Consumer loans that were 90+ days delinquent, excluding the , fell 14% versus the prior year period to $8.4 billion, or 2.1% of consumer loans.

Citicorp
increased 6% from the prior year period to $4.3 billion.  The increase largely reflected continued positive operating leverage in the quarter as operating expenses and total credit costs each declined 3% while revenues remained unchanged from the prior year period.
net income
 
Citicorp
in the second quarter 2012 decreased 3% from the prior year period to $1.6 billion.  The decrease largely reflected significantly lower net credit losses, which declined $736 million, or 25%, to $2.2 billion, which offset a $681 million, or 49%, reduction in loan loss reserve releases to $715 million, both compared to the second quarter 2011.  The decline in reserve releases was largely in .  Citicorp's consumer loans 90+ days delinquent fell 17% from the prior year period to $3.1 billion, and the 90+ days delinquent ratio fell 25 basis points to 1.08% of loans.

operating expenses
 
Citicorp
grew 10% versus the prior year period to $527 billion, primarily reflecting strong growth in corporate loans and growth in Latin America and North America consumer loans.  Consumer loans grew 2% to $284 billion and corporate loans grew 22% to $243 billion, both versus the prior year period.

revenues
of $9.8 billion were unchanged from the prior year period.  Revenue growth of 4% in to $5.1 billion was offset by international revenues, which declined 4% to $4.6 billion.  The decline in international revenues largely reflected the impact of foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes (FX).(8)  On a constant dollar basis (i.e., excluding the impact of FX), revenues were up 4%.
North America GCB

North America revenues
GCB
grew 4% to $5.1 billion driven by higher retail banking revenues that were partially offset by lower revenues from Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services.  Retail banking revenues grew 32% to $1.6 billion from the second quarter 2011, largely due to higher mortgage revenues.  Citi-branded cards revenues declined 8% to $2.0 billion, and Citi retail services revenues declined 3% to $1.5 billion, both versus the prior year period.  The lower results in cards primarily reflected lower average loan balances for both businesses as Citi-branded cards loans declined 3% and Citi retail services loans declined 4% from second quarter 2011, as well as lower yields.
 
North Americanet income
GCB
was $1.2 billion, 8% higher than the second quarter 2011.  The growth in net income was largely driven by the higher revenues and a $625 million decrease in net credit losses that was partially offset by a $427 million reduction in loan loss reserve releases versus the prior year period.  Operating expenses in the second quarter grew 5% from the prior year period to $2.5 billion largely due to a legal reserve in the current quarter related to the interchange litigation.  Absent this reserve, expenses would have been down slightly versus the prior year period.
 
North America credit quality
GCB
continued to improve as net credit losses fell $625 million, or 29%, to $1.5 billion compared to the prior year period.  Net credit losses versus the prior year period improved in Citi-branded cards, down 32% to $840 million, Citi retail services, down 26% to $609 million, and retail banking, down 22% to $62 million.  Delinquency rates continued to improve in both Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services across all delinquency buckets versus the prior year period.  Retail banking 90+ days delinquency rates increased versus the prior year period largely reflecting the impact of portfolio growth and seasoning, but nonetheless remained at historically low levels.  The reserve release in the second quarter 2012 was $814 million, $427 million lower than in the second quarter 2011.
 
International revenues
GCB
declined 4% to $4.6 billion versus the second quarter 2011, largely reflecting the impact of FX.  Compared to the prior year period, revenues declined 4% in Latin America to $2.3 billion, 4% in Asia to $1.9 billion, and 11% in EMEA to $366 million.  However, on a constant dollar basis, revenues grew 8% in Latin America, were flat in Asia and decreased 1% in EMEA.  All three regions had year-over-year growth in average loans and average deposits during the second quarter 2012 on a constant dollar basis.
 
International net income
GCB
fell 12% (3% on a constant dollar basis) from the prior year period to $795 million, primarily due to a net loan loss reserve build of $86 million in the second quarter 2012 compared to a net release of $91 million in the prior year period.  Operating expenses in the second quarter 2012 declined 5%  (increased 3% on a constant dollar basis) from the second quarter 2011 to $2.9 billion.
 
International credit quality
GCB
improved from the prior year period as net credit losses fell 12% to $613 million.  The net loan loss reserve build of $86 million in the second quarter 2012 primarily reflected a reserve build in Latin America of $120 million compared to a release of $21 million in the prior year period.  EMEA and Asia recorded small reserve releases in the second quarter 2012.  Overall credit quality in international improved even as loan portfolios continued to grow.  90+ days delinquency rates were generally stable across all products in all regions.

Credit and securitized products revenues declined largely due to a weaker market environment.
 
Equity Markets revenues

Lending revenues
increased 70% to $608 million from the prior year period.

Private bank revenues
increased 3% to $570 million (excluding $2 million of CVA/DVA) from the prior year period driven primarily by growth in North America lending and deposits.
 
Securities and Banking
net income
was $1.4 billion in the second quarter 2012, up 18% from the prior year period, primarily reflecting the 1% decline in year-over-year revenues combined with an 8% decline in operating expenses driven by efficiency savings and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by approximately $89 million in repositioning costs.

Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based upon a review by Citigroup's risk officers.  Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for Consumer loans: Consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due, and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency.  As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans.

Excludes SOP 3-03 purchased distressed loans.

The first quarter of 2012  increase in non-accrual consumer loans in North America is attributable to an $0.8 billion reclassification from accrual to non-accrual status of home equity loans where the related residential first mortgage is delinquent. Of the $0.8 billion of home equity loans, $0.7 billion was current and $0.1 billion was 30 to 89 days past due as of March 31, 2012.  This reclassification reflects regulatory guidance that was issued on January 31, 2012.

Tangible Book Value Per Share and Tangible Common Equity (TCE) (and related ratios) are non-GAAP financial measures.  TCE, as defined by Citigroup, represents Common equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs) net of the related deferred taxes.  Other companies may calculate TCE in a manner different from Citigroup.  A reconciliation of Citigroup's total stockholders' equity to TCE and Tangible Book Value per Share follows:
