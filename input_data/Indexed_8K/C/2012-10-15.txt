(d)  Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
New York, October 15, 2012  Citigroup Inc. today reported net income for the third quarter 2012 of $468 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, on revenues of $14.0 billion.
 
CVA/DVA was a negative $776 million in the third quarter, resulting from the improvement in Citi's credit spreads, compared to a positive $1.9 billion in the prior year period.  Third quarter results also included a pre-tax loss of $4.7 billion ($2.9 billion after-tax) from the previously announced sale of a 14% interest and other-than-temporary impairment of the carrying value of Citi's remaining 35% interest in the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney (MSSB) joint venture.  In addition, third quarter results included a $582 million tax benefit related to the resolution of certain tax audit items.  Excluding CVA/DVA and the loss on MSSB, third quarter revenues were $19.4 billion, up 3% from the prior period.  Excluding CVA/DVA, the loss on MSSB and the tax benefit, earnings were $1.06 per diluted share, up 26% from the prior year period.
 
Vikram Pandit, Citi's Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our core businesses showed momentum during the quarter as we increased lending and generated higher operating revenues. These earnings highlight the strength of Citicorp and its diversification by product and region.  For the third straight quarter, we had positive operating leverage in each of our three core businesses. Citigroup in total also had positive operating leverage as Citi Holdings had a smaller impact on our overall results.
 
"Last month's price agreement on MSSB has given us more certainty on our exit from that business and added to the reduction of Citi Holdings, which is now only 9% of our balance sheet.
 
"We generated additional capital during the quarter and our Tier 1 Common Ratio was estimated at 8.6% on a Basel III basis at the end of the period.  We are managing risk very carefully given global economic conditions so we can continue to grow our businesses safely and soundly," concluded Mr. Pandit.
 
Citigroup revenues
of $19.4 billion, excluding CVA/DVA and the loss on MSSB, were 3% above the prior year period, driven by 5% growth in Citicorp revenues, offset by a 10% decline in Citi Holdings revenues primarily resulting from the ongoing wind down of those assets.  Citi Holdings revenues represented 5% of total Citigroup revenues, excluding CVA/DVA and the loss on MSSB.
 
Citicorp revenues
of $17.6 billion in the third quarter 2012 included $(799) million of CVA/DVA reported within .  Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp revenues were $18.4 billion, 5% above the prior year period with 15% growth in revenuesand 2% growth in revenues, partially offset by a 2% decline in revenues.

Citi Holdings revenues
of $(3.7) billion in the third quarter 2012 included $23 million of CVA/DVA and the $4.7 billion pre-tax loss on MSSB. Excluding CVA/DVA and the loss on MSSB, Citi Holdings revenues were $971 million compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year period.  Lower revenues in and in drove the decline in Citi Holdings revenues from the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in revenues.  The decline in revenues reflected the ongoing decline in assets while the decline in reflected a lower equity contribution from MSSB and lower private equity marks.  The revenues grew versus the prior year period due to lower funding costs as well as an improvement in asset marks.  Total Citi Holdings assets of $171 billion declined $76billion, or 31%, from the third quarter 2011.  Citi Holdings assets at the end of the third quarter 2012 represented approximately 9% of total Citigroup assets.

Citigroup's net income
declined to $468 million in the third quarter 2012 from $3.8 billion in the prior year period.  Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA, the loss on MSSB and the tax benefit in the third quarter 2012, Citigroup net income was $3.3 billion, 27% higher than the third quarter 2011.  Operating expenses of $12.2 billion were 2% lower than the prior year period.  Citigroup's cost of credit in the third quarter 2012 was $2.7 billion, 20% below the prior year period, reflecting a $0.5 billion improvement in net credit losses and an $87million increase in net loan loss reserve releases. Citigroup's net credit losses in the third quarter 2012 included approximately $635 million of incremental mortgage charge-offs in Citi Holdings required by new OCC guidance regarding the treatment of mortgage loans where the borrower has gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  The vast majority of the charge-offs were related to loans which were current.  The incremental $635 million of charge-offs was substantially offset by a related reserve release of approximately $600 million, and thus did not have a significant impact on reported net earnings.  Citigroup's provision for income taxes was a benefit of $1.5 billion in the third quarter 2012 (including the $582 million tax benefit), compared to an expense of $1.3 billion in the prior year period.
 
Citigroup's allowance for loan losses
was $25.9 billion at quarter end, or 4.0% of total loans, compared to $32.1 billion, or 5.1%, in the prior year period.  The $1.5 billion net release of loan loss reserves in the quarter increased 6% versus the prior year period.  Reserve releases in Citicorp of $696 million were 22% lower than the third quarter 2011, predominantly reflecting lower releases in partially offset by a net reserve release in .  Reserve releases in Citi Holdings of $813million were 52% higher than the prior year period, primarily reflecting approximately $600 million of reserve releases in specifically related to the incremental charge-offs resulting from the OCC guidance mentioned above, partially offset by lower loan loss reserve releases in the .  Citigroup asset quality continued to improve as total non-accrual assets fell 5% to $12.7 billion compared to the third quarter 2011.  Corporate non-accrual loans fell 42% to $2.4 billion, while consumer non-accrual loans grew 25% to $9.8 billion, predominantly reflecting the new OCC guidance mentioned above which added $1.5 billion to consumer non-accrual loans.  Consumer loans that were 90+ days delinquent, excluding the , fell 13% versus the prior year period to $8.0 billion, or 2.0% of consumer loans.

decreased 18% from the prior year period to $4.1 billion, predominantly reflecting the impact of CVA/DVA.  Excluding CVA/DVA, net income grew 20% from the prior year period to $4.6 billion, largely reflecting continued positive operating leverage, as revenues grew 5% and operating expenses declined 2%, as well as a 14% decline in total credit costs.

Citicorp
in the third quarter 2012 decreased 14% from the prior year period to $1.5 billion.  The decrease largely reflected lower net credit losses, which declined $459 million, or 17%, to $2.2 billion, partially offset by a $191 million, or 22%, reduction in loan loss reserve releases to $696 million, both compared to the third quarter 2011.  The decline in reserve releases was largely in .

revenues
of $10.2 billion rose 2% from the prior year period, reflecting volume growth across most businesses, partially offset by ongoing spread compression.  Revenues also benefited from higher U.S. mortgage revenues.  Revenue growth of 6% in to $5.4 billion was partially offset by international revenues, which declined 2% to $4.8 billion.  The decline in international revenues largely reflected the impact of foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes (FX), as the U.S. dollar generally strengthened versus local currencies(7).  On a constant dollar basis (i.e. excluding the impact of FX) revenues rose 4%.

net income
grew 7% versus the prior year period (9% on a constant dollar basis) to $2.2 billion, reflecting the growth in revenues and lower net credit losses, partially offset by lower loan loss reserve releases. Expenses of $5.4 billion were essentially flat (up 3% on a constant dollar basis) versus the prior year period as the impact of volume growth was reduced by efficiency savings.
 
North America revenues
GCB
grew 6% to $5.4 billion driven by higher retail banking revenues that were partially offset by lower revenues from the cards businesses (Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services).  Retail banking revenues grew 35% to $1.7 billion from the third quarter 2011, primarily reflecting higher mortgage revenues.  Citi-branded cards revenues declined 4% to $2.1 billion, and Citi retail services revenues declined 4% to $1.6 billion reflecting lower average loan balances as Citi-branded cards loans declined 3% and Citi retail services loans declined 4% versus the prior year period.
 
North Americanet income
GCB
was $1.3 billion, 18% higher than the third quarter 2011.  The growth in net income was largely driven by higher revenues and a $503 million decrease in net credit losses that were partially offset by a $438 million reduction in loan loss reserve releases versus the prior year period.  Operating expenses in the third quarter grew 2% from the prior year period to $2.5 billion largely due to higher retail channel mortgage volumes.
 
North America credit quality
GCB
continued to improve as net credit losses fell $503 million, or 27%, to $1.4 billion compared to the prior year period.  Net credit losses versus the prior year period improved in Citi-branded cards (down 32% to $745 million) and Citi retail services (down 23% to $534 million), while net credit losses in retail banking were up 11% to $72 million.  Delinquency rates continued to improve in both Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services versus the prior year period.  Retail banking delinquency rates increased modestly versus the prior year period largely reflecting the impact of portfolio growth and seasoning, but nonetheless remained at historically low levels.  The reserve release in the third quarter 2012 was $518 million, $438 million lower than in the third quarter 2011.
 
International revenues
GCB
declined 2% to $4.8 billion versus the third quarter 2011, largely reflecting the impact of FX.  Compared to the prior year period, revenues were essentially flat in Latin America at $2.4 billion, declined 4% in Asia to $2.0 billion, and rose 1% in EMEA to $381 million.  On a constant dollar basis, international revenues rose 3% versus the prior year period, with 7% growth in Latin America, a 2% decline in Asia and 7% growth in EMEA.  All three regions had year-over-year growth in average loans and average deposits during the third quarter 2012 on a constant dollar basis.

Net credit losses in increased by $149 million or 9% from the prior year period to $1.8 billion, while the loan loss reserve release increased $506 million to $761 million.  The increase in net credit losses and the loan loss reserve release in was driven by the incremental charge-offs of approximately $635 million and corresponding loan loss reserve release of approximately $600 million relating to the new OCC guidance described above.  Excluding these incremental charge-offs arising from the new OCC guidance, net credit losses in would have declined by $486 million or 29%.

(2) Minority interests reflect the impact of transactions related to interests in the MSSB JV and Akbank. As previously announced, third quarter 2012 results include a non-cash GAAP charge to net income of $4.7 billion pre-tax ($2.9 billion after-tax) relating to the MSSB JV, consisting of (i) a pre-tax loss on Citigroup's sale of the 14% interest in the MSSB JV to Morgan Stanley of $1.4 billion pre-tax ($800 million after-tax) and (ii) an other-than-temporary impairment of the carrying value of Citigroup's remaining 35% interest in the MSSB JV of $3.3 billion pre-tax ($2.1 billion after-tax). These charges were recorded in Citi Holdings - . See Appendix B. Second quarter 2012 included a pre-tax loss on the partial sale of Citi's minority interest in Akbank T.A.S.

(3) Third quarter 2012 results include a $582 million tax benefit related to the resolution of certain tax audit items, recorded in Corporate / Other. See Appendix B.
(4) Citigroup's estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common Ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. Citi believes this ratio provides useful information to investors and others by measuring Citigroup's progress against expected future regulatory capital standards. For the calculation of Citigroup's estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common Ratio as of the third quarter 2012, see Appendix C. Generally, the estimate has been calculated based on the U.S. regulators proposed rules relating to Basel III (NPR), including the proposed "advanced approaches" for determining risk-weighted assets under the NPR, as well as the final U.S. market risk capital rules (Basel II.5).  Citigroup's estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common Ratio is based on its current interpretation, expectations and understanding of the respective Basel III requirements and is necessarily subject to final regulatory clarity and rulemaking, model calibration and other implementation guidance in the U.S.
(5) Tangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. This metric is a capital adequacy metric used and relied upon by investors and industry analysts. See Appendix D for a reconciliation of this metric to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
(6) Assumes a tax rate on CVA / DVA of 37.5% in third quarter 2012, 36.2% in second quarter 2012, and 37.9% in third quarter 2011. Assumes a tax rate on gain / (loss) on minority investments of 38.2% in third quarter 2012 and 35.4% in second quarter 2012.
(7) See Appendix E.
(8) Lending revenues exclude the impact of gains / losses on hedges related to accrual loans.  Hedges on accrual loans reflect the mark-to-market on credit derivatives used to hedge the corporate loan portfolio. The fixed premium cost of these hedges is included (netted against) the core lending revenues to reflect the cost of the credit protection.

Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based upon a review by Citigroup's risk officers.  Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for Consumer loans: Consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due, and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency.  As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans.

The first quarter of 2012 increase in non-accrual consumer loans in North America was attributable to an $0.8 billion reclassification from accrual to non-accrual status of home equity loans where the related residential first mortgage was delinquent. Of the $0.8 billion of home equity loans, $0.7 billion was current and $0.1 billion was 30 to 89 days past due as of March 31, 2012.  This reclassification reflected regulatory guidance that was issued on January 31, 2012.
