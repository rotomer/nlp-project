If the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof does not declare a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock for any Dividend Period prior to the related Dividend Payment Date, that dividend will not accrue, and the Company will have no obligation to pay, and Holders shall have no right to receive, a dividend for that Dividend Period on the related Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock or any other series of preferred stock or common stock are declared for any subsequent period. References herein to the "accrual" of dividends refer only to the determination of the amount of such dividend and do not imply that any right to a dividend arises prior to the date on which a dividend is declared.
Noncumulative Dividends
(c) . So long as any share of Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless as to a Dividend Payment Date full dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside for the Dividend Period then ending, the Company will not, and will cause its subsidiaries not to, during the next succeeding Dividend Period that commences on such Dividend Payment Date, declare or pay any dividend on, make any distributions relating to, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to, any Junior Stock, or make any guarantee payment with respect thereto, other than:

To the extent any such instructions request the voting of a fractional interest of a
Section 4.04
 
share of deposited Preferred Stock, the Depositary shall aggregate such interest with all other fractional interests resulting from requests with the same voting instructions and shall vote the number of whole votes resulting from such aggregation in accordance with the instructions received in such requests.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to Citigroup Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, in connection with the public offering of 1,500,000 depositary shares (the "Depositary Shares"), representing an aggregate of 60,000 shares (the "Preferred Shares") of the Company's 5.950% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate noncumulative preferred stock, series A, par value $1.00 and $25,000 liquidation preference per share (the "Preferred Stock"). The Preferred Shares are to be deposited with Computershare Inc. and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare Trust") acting jointly as depositary (collectively, the "Depositary"), pursuant to the Deposit Agreement, dated October 29, 2012 (the "Deposit Agreement"), among the Company, the Depositary, as depositary, Computershare Trust, as registrar and transfer agent, and the holders from time to time of receipts issued under the Deposit Agreement to evidence the Depositary Shares. On October 22, 2012, the Company entered into an Underwriting Agreement, dated October 22, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as representative of the underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), relating to the sale by the Company to the Underwriters of the Depositary Shares.
This opinion is being delivered in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act (as defined below).
In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of (i) the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-172562) of the Company, relating to preferred stock, depositary shares and other securities of the Company, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on May 11, 2011 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), allowing for delayed offerings pursuant to Rule 415 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act (the "Rules and Regulations") (such registration statement being hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement"), (ii) an executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement, (iii) an executed copy of the Deposit Agreement; (iv) an executed certificate evidencing the Preferred Shares registered in the name of Computershare Trust Company, N.A., (v) an executed Receipt registered in the name of Cede & Co., relating to 1,500,000 Depositary Shares (the "Receipts"); (vi) the Certificate of Designations (the "Certificate of Designations") designating the Preferred

Stock, as filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 26, 2012 and certified by such Secretary of State; (vii) a copy of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended and in effect as of the date hereof, as certified by Michael J. Tarpley, Assistant Secretary of the Company (the "Assistant Secretary"); (viii) the By-Laws of the Company, as amended and as in effect on the date hereof, as certified by the Assistant Secretary; and (ix) a copy of certain resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company, adopted on October 17, 2012 and certain resolutions of the Pricing Committee thereof, adopted on October 22, 2012, as certified by the Assistant Secretary. We have also examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions set forth herein.
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. In making our examination of executed documents, we have assumed that the parties thereto, other than the Company, had the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder and have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by such parties of such documents and that such documents constitute valid and binding obligations of such parties. As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein that were not independently established or verified, we have relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers, trustees and other representatives of the Company and others.
We do not express any opinion as to any laws other than Delaware corporate law and statutory trust law and the laws of the State of New York. Insofar as the opinions expressed herein relate to matters governed by laws other than those set forth in the preceding sentence, we have assumed, without having made any independent investigation, that such laws do not affect any of the opinions set forth herein. The opinions expressed herein are based on laws in effect on the date hereof, which laws are subject to change with possible retroactive effect.
Based on and subject to the foregoing and to the other qualifications and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Preferred Shares have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Company under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and, when the Preferred Stock Certificate is delivered to and paid for in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
2. The Receipts, when issued under the Deposit Agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Deposit Agreement and upon payment by the Underwriters in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, will be legally issued and will entitle the holders thereof to the rights specified in such Receipts and in the Deposit Agreement.
