The Company shall have the sole right to accept offers to purchase the Notes and may reject any such offer in whole or in part.

The Company agrees to pay each Agent a commission, on the Settlement Date with respect to each sale of Notes by the Company as a result of a solicitation made by such Agent, in an amount agreed upon by the Agent and the Company. Such commission shall be payable as specified in the Procedures. Without the prior approval of the Company, no Agent (acting on an agency basis) may reallow any portion of the commission payable pursuant hereto to dealers or purchasers in connection with the offer and sale of any Notes.
 
Subject to the provisions of this Section 2 and to the Procedures, offers for the purchase of Notes may be solicited by an Agent as agent for the Company at such time and in such amounts as such Agent shall deem advisable. The Company may from time to time offer Notes for sale otherwise than through an Agent.

If the MTN Prospectus is amended or supplemented (other than by a Supplement or an amendment or supplement relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes), each Agent shall be furnished with such information relating to such filing as it may reasonably request, and no Agent shall be obligated to solicit offers to purchase Notes so long as it is not reasonably satisfied that such amendment or supplement complies in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. At any time during an Offering Period or during the time a prospectus relating to the Notes is required to be delivered under the Securities Act with respect to a particular offering of Notes, the Company will promptly advise each Agent participating in such offering of (i) the filing of any amendment or supplement to the MTN Prospectus (other than a Supplement or an amendment or supplement to be made pursuant to incorporation by reference of a document filed under the Exchange Act or relating solely to an offering of securities other than the Notes), (ii) the filing of any amendment to the Registration Statement, (iii) the receipt by the Company of comments from the Commission relating to or requests by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement or any amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any notice objecting to its use or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (v) the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose.

The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to each offering that are required to be prepared, furnished or delivered by it.

(b)Each Agent severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Agent, but only with reference to written information relating to such Agent furnished to the Company by such Agent specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that any Agent may otherwise have.
              
 
(c)Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 6, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying partys choice at the indemnifying partys expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying partys election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.

(d)In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Agents severally agree to contribute to the aggregate Losses (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company and one or more of the Agents may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Agents on the other from the offering of the Notes; , , that in no case shall (i) any Agent (except as may be provided in any agreement among Agents relating to the offering of the Notes) be responsible for any amount in excess of the discount or commission applicable to the Notes purchased by such Agent hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Agents severally and not jointly shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and benefits received by the Agents shall be deemed to be equal to the total discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth in the applicable Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Agents on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 6, each person who controls an Agent within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Agent shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
