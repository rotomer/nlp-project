Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement; Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
     On November 15, 2004, Computer Associates International, Inc. (the "Company") agreed to issue and sell $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.75%, 5-year senior unsecured notes and $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.625%, 10-year senior unsecured notes (collectively, the "Notes") through a private offering to qualified institutional buyers under Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States under SEC Regulation S. The Company has the option to redeem the 5-year notes and the 10-year notes at any time, at redemption prices equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes of such series being redeemed and (ii) the present value of the principal and interest payable over the life of the Notes, discounted at a rate equal to 15 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively, over a comparable U.S. Treasury bond yield. The maturity of the Notes may be accelerated by the holders upon certain events of default, including failure to make payments when due and failure to comply with covenants in the Notes, as provided in the Notes. The Company also agreed for the benefit of the holders to register the Notes under the Securities Act of 1933 so that the Notes may be sold in the public market. If the Company does not meet certain deadlines for filing and effectiveness of the registration statement, the interest rate on the Notes will increase by 25 basis points for up to 90 days and by an additional 25 basis points thereafter, until the delay is cured. The Company signed a purchase agreement with various investment banks under which the Company agreed to issue and sell the Notes to the banks, and the banks, subject to customary closing conditions, agreed to purchase the Notes from the Company, at a purchase price equal to 99.261% of the principal amount, in the case of the 5-year notes, and 98.855% of the principal amount, in the case of the 10-year notes, for resale under Rule 144A and Regulation S. Several of the purchasers or their affiliates have provided investment and commercial banking services to the Company from time to time, with some being lenders under the Company's existing credit facilities, and may continue to provide such services in the future. The Notes were issued on November 18, 2004 under an indenture between the Company and the trustee for the holders of the Notes.
     The foregoing description of the Notes and related matters is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement, the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement filed as exhibits hereto.

The Offered Securities are to be issued under an indenture, to be dated as of November 18, 2004 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Trustee").

Introductory.
 
pursuant to which the Company will agree to register the resale of the Offered Securities under the Securities Act subject to the terms and conditions specified therein.
     The Company hereby agrees with the several Purchasers as follows:
     2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the several Purchasers that:
Representations and Warranties of the Company.
     (a) A preliminary offering circular and an offering circular relating to the Offered Securities to be offered by the Purchasers have been prepared by the Company. Such preliminary offering circular and offering circular as supplemented as of the date of this Agreement, and any other document approved by the Company for distribution to prospective purchasers in connection with the contemplated resale of the Offered Securities are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Offering Document". Any references herein to the Offering Document shall be deemed to include all amendments and supplements thereto and all documents incorporated by reference therein, unless otherwise noted. On the date of this Agreement, the final Offering Document does not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The preceding sentence does not apply to statements in or omissions from the Offering Document based upon written information furnished to the Company by any Purchaser through Banc of America Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (the "Representatives") specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information is that described as such in Section 7(b). Except as disclosed in the Offering Document, on the date of this Agreement, the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K most recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") and all subsequent reports (collectively, the "Exchange Act Reports") which have been filed by the Company with the Commission or sent to shareholders pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), do not, in each case as of their respective dates, include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Such documents, when they were filed with the Commission, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

     (c) Each significant subsidiary ("Significant Subsidiary", as such term is defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act) of the Company has been
 
duly incorporated and is a validly existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Offering Document and the Exchange Act Reports; and each Significant Subsidiary of the Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing in all other jurisdictions in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except to the extent that all such failures to be so qualified and to be in good standing would not, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary of the Company has been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid and nonassessable; and the capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, is owned free of liens, encumbrances and defects, other than any such liens, encumbrances and defects which would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

     (e) The Indenture has been duly authorized by the Company; the Offered Securities have been duly authorized by the Company; and when the Offered Securities are delivered and paid for pursuant to this Agreement on the Closing Date (as defined below), (i) the Indenture will have been duly executed and delivered by the Company, (ii) the Indenture will conform to the description thereof contained in the final Offering Document and (iii) the Indenture and such Offered Securities will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
     (f) The Registration Rights Agreement has been duly authorized by the Company, and, upon its execution and delivery by the Company, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Purchasers, will constitute the valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles, and except as any rights to indemnity thereunder may be limited by federal and state securities laws and public policy considerations underlying such laws.
     (g) No consent, approval, authorization, or order of, or filing with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required for the performance by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture and Registration Rights Agreement or in connection with the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities by the Company to the Purchasers, except for (i) filings under state securities laws and (ii) the filing of a registration statement in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement as described in the Offering Document.
     (h) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement, and the issuance and sale of the Offered
 
Securities hereunder and compliance with the terms and provisions hereof and thereof will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, (i) any statute, any rule, regulation or order of any governmental agency or body or any court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective properties, (ii) any agreement or instrument to which the Company or any such subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any such subsidiary is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company or any such subsidiary is subject or (iii) the charter or by-laws of the Company or any such subsidiary, except, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) only, for any such breach, violation or default which would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and the Company has full corporate power and authority to authorize, issue and sell the Offered Securities.

     (l) No labor dispute with the employees of the Company or any subsidiary exists or, to the knowledge of the Company, is imminent that would have a Material Adverse Effect.
     (m) To the best knowledge of the Company, the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries own, possess or can acquire on terms that would not have a Material Adverse Effect, all trademarks, trade names and other rights to inventions, know-how, patents, copyrights and confidential information (collectively, "intellectual property rights") currently employed by them in the businesses now operated by them, and have not received any notice of infringement of or conflict with asserted rights of others with respect to any intellectual property rights that would reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect.
     (n) Except as disclosed in the Offering Document, neither the Company nor any of its Significant Subsidiaries is in violation of any statute, any rule, regulation, decision or order of any governmental agency or body or any court, domestic or foreign, relating to the use, disposal or release of hazardous or toxic substances or relating to the protection or restoration of the environment or human exposure to hazardous or toxic substances (collectively, "environmental laws"), owns or operates any real property contaminated with any substance that is subject to any environmental laws, is liable for any off-site disposal or contamination pursuant to any environmental laws, or is subject
 
to any claim relating to any environmental laws, which violation, contamination, liability or claim would, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; and the Company is not aware of any pending investigation which could reasonably be expected to lead to such a claim.
     (o) Except as disclosed in the Offering Document, there are no pending actions, suits or proceedings against or (to the best knowledge of the Company) affecting the Company, any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties that would individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect, or would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture or the Registration Rights Agreement which are otherwise material in the context of the sale of the Offered Securities; and no such actions, suits or proceedings are, to the Company's knowledge, threatened.
     (p) The financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Offering Document present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates shown and their results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown, and such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States applied on a consistent basis.

     (t) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Purchasers contained in Section 4 hereof, the offer and sale of the Offered Securities by the Company to the Purchasers in the manner contemplated by this Agreement will be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act; and it is not necessary

     The Purchasers propose to offer the Offered Securities to investors initially at the offering price to investors set forth in the final Offering Document.

     (a) The Company will advise the Representatives promptly of any proposal to amend or supplement the Offering Document and will not effect such amendment or supplementation without each of the Representatives' consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If, at any time prior to the completion of the initial resale of the Offered Securities by the Purchasers, any event occurs as a result of which the Offering Document, as then amended or supplemented, would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company promptly will notify the Representatives of such event and promptly will prepare, at its own expense, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission. Neither the Representatives' consent to, nor the Purchasers' delivery to offerees or investors of, any such amendment or supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.
     (b) The Company will furnish to the Representatives copies of any preliminary offering circular, the Offering Document and all amendments and supplements to such

The Company will pay the expenses of printing and distributing to the Purchasers all such documents.
     (c) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Offered Securities for sale and the determination of their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as the Representatives designate and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the resale of the Offered Securities by the Purchasers, provided that the Company will not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction.
     (d) During the period of five years hereafter (to the extent that the Offered Securities are then outstanding), the Company will furnish to the Representatives and, upon request, to each of the other Purchasers, as soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of its annual report to shareholders for such year, but only to the extent that such annual report is not otherwise publicly available; and the Company will furnish to the Representatives and, upon request, to each of the other Purchasers, as soon as available, a copy of each periodic or current report and any definitive proxy statement of the Company filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act or distributed by the Company to its shareholders, but only to the extent that such periodic or current report or definitive proxy statement is not otherwise publicly available.
     (e) During the period of two years after the Closing Date, the Company will, upon request, furnish to the Representatives, each of the other Purchasers and any holder of Offered Securities a copy of the restrictions on transfer applicable to the Offered Securities.
     (f) During the period of two years after the Closing Date, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its affiliates (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) to, resell any of the Offered Securities that have been reacquired by any of them.

     (h) Any information provided by the Company to publishers of publicly available databases about the terms of the Offered Securities shall include a statement that the
 
Offered Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act and are subject to restrictions under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and Regulation S.
     (i) The Company will refuse, and will cause all applicable trustees and transfer agents to refuse, to register any transfer of Offered Securities if such transfer is not made in accordance with the provisions of Regulation S under the Securities Act, pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to an available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act; provided that the provisions of this paragraph shall not be applicable to any Offered Security which has been transferred pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144 under the Securities Act and, as a result of which, or otherwise, is no longer subject to restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act.
     (j) All of the Offered Securities will contain a legend to the effect that the transfer thereof is prohibited except in accordance with the provisions of Regulation S, pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act and that hedging transactions involving those Offered Securities may not be conducted unless in compliance with the Securities Act; provided that such legend may be removed if such Offered Securities have been transferred pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and, as a result of which, or otherwise, is no longer subject to restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act.
     (k) The Company will pay all expenses incidental to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement, including (i) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and its professional advisers; (ii) all expenses in connection with the execution, issue, authentication, packaging and initial delivery of the Offered Securities, the preparation and printing of this Agreement, the Offered Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Offering Document and amendments and supplements thereto, and any other document relating to the issuance, offer, sale and delivery of the Offered Securities; (iii) the cost of any advertising approved by the Company in connection with the issue of the Offered Securities; (iv) any expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with qualification of the Offered Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as the Representatives designate and the printing of memoranda relating thereto; (v) any fees charged by investment rating agencies for the rating of the Offered Securities; and (vi) expenses incurred in distributing preliminary offering circulars and the Offering Document (including any amendments and supplements thereto) to or as directed by the Purchasers. The Company will also pay or reimburse the Purchasers (to the extent incurred by them) for all travel expenses of the Purchasers and the Company's officers and employees and any other expenses of the Purchasers and the Company in connection with attending or hosting meetings with prospective purchasers of the Offered Securities from the Purchasers.
     (l) In connection with the offering, until the Representatives shall have notified the Company and the other Purchasers of the completion of the resale of the Offered Securities, neither the Company nor any of its affiliates has or will, either alone or with one or more other persons, bid for or purchase for any account in which it or any of its affiliates has a beneficial interest any Offered Securities or attempt to induce any person
 
to purchase any Offered Securities; and neither it nor any of its affiliates will make bids or purchases for the purpose of creating actual, or apparent, active trading in, or of raising the price of, the Offered Securities.
     (m) Neither the Company, nor any of its Affiliates, nor any person acting on its or their behalf will engage in any directed selling efforts with respect to the Offered Securities, and each of them will comply with the offering restrictions requirement of Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.
     (n) For a period from the date of the initial offering of the Offered Securities by the Purchasers through the Closing Date, the Company will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any United States dollar-denominated debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge or disposition, without the prior written consent of the Representatives. The Company will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances where such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbor of Regulation S thereunder to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Offered Securities.
     6. The obligations of the several Purchasers to purchase and pay for the Offered Securities will be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company herein, to the accuracy of the statements of officers of the Company made pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions precedent:
Conditions of the Obligations of the Purchasers.
     (a) The Purchasers shall have received a letter, dated the date of this Agreement, of KPMG LLP confirming that they are independent public accountants within the meaning of the Securities Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder ("Rules and Regulations"), are a "registered public accounting firm" with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and to the effect that:

     (iii) on the basis of the review referred to in clause (ii) above, a reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the Company, inquiries of officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting
 
matters and other specified procedures, nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:
     (A) the unaudited financial statements included in the Exchange Act Reports do not comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the related published Rules and Regulations or any material modifications should be made to such unaudited financial statements for them to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States;
     (B) at the date of the latest available balance sheet read by such accountants, or at a subsequent specified date not more than three business days prior to the date of this Agreement, there was any change in the capital stock (except for the issuance of common stock pursuant to stock options exercised), increase in long-term debt or any decreases in excess of 10% in consolidated net current assets or stockholders' equity of the Company and its subsidiaries, as compared with amounts shown on the latest balance sheet included in the Exchange Act Reports; or
     (C) for the period from the closing date of the latest income statement included in the Exchange Act Reports to the closing date of the latest available income statement read by such accountants there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, in consolidated net revenues or decreases in the total or per share amounts of net income;
     except in all cases set forth in clauses (B) and (C) above for changes, increases or decreases which the Offering Document or Exchange Act Reports disclose have occurred or may occur or which are described in such letter; and
     (iv) they have compared specified dollar amounts (or percentages derived from such dollar amounts) and other financial information contained in the Offering Document and the Exchange Act Reports (in each case to the extent that such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries subject to the internal controls of the Company's accounting system or are derived directly from such records by analysis or computation) with the results obtained from inquiries, a reading of such general accounting records and other procedures specified in such letter and have found such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information to be in agreement with such results, except as otherwise specified in such letter.
     (b) Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred (i) a change in U.S. or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls as would, in the judgment of the Representatives, be likely to prejudice materially the success of the proposed issue, sale or distribution of the Offered Securities, whether in the primary market or in respect of dealings in the secondary market, or (ii) (A) any change, or any development or event involving a prospective change, in the financial condition, business, properties or results
 
of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole which, in the judgment of a majority in interest of the Purchasers including the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the offering or the sale of and payment for the Offered Securities as contemplated in the Offering Document; (B) any downgrading in the rating of any debt securities of the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Securities Act), or any public announcement that any such organization has under surveillance or review its rating of any debt securities of the Company (other than an announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating); (C) any suspension or limitation of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such exchange, or any suspension of trading of any securities of the Company on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (D) any banking moratorium declared by U.S. federal or New York authorities; (E) any material disruption or suspension of securities settlement or clearance services; or (F) any outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is involved, any declaration of war by the United States Congress or any other substantial national or international calamity or emergency if, in the judgment of a majority in interest of the Purchasers including the Representatives, the effect of any such outbreak, escalation, declaration, calamity or emergency makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion of the offering or the sale of and payment for the Offered Securities as contemplated in the Offering Document.
     (c) The Purchasers shall have received an opinion, dated the Closing Date, of Jay H. Diamond, Esq., Vice President and Associate General Counsel of the Company, that (subject to acceptable assumptions and qualifications):
     (i) The Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized, with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Offering Document and Exchange Act Reports; and the Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in good standing in all other jurisdictions in which its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except to the extent that all failures to be so qualified or in good standing, in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect;
     (ii) To such counsel's knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries (A) is in violation of its charter or by-laws, (B) is in default, and no event has occurred, which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default, in the due performance or observance of any term, covenant or condition contained in any material agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it is bound or to which any of its properties or assets is subject or (C) is in violation of any law, ordinance, governmental rule, regulation or court decree to which it or its property or assets may be subject or has failed to obtain any license, permit, certificate, franchise or other governmental authorization or permit necessary to the ownership of its property or to the conduct of its business
 
except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), for those defaults, violations or failures which, either individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect;
     (iii) To the best of such counsel's knowledge and other than as set forth in the Offering Document, there are no pending actions, suits or proceedings against the Company, any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened by governmental authorities or threatened by others;
     (iv) Each of this Agreement, the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; the Offered Securities have been duly authorized, executed, issued and delivered and conform to the description thereof contained in the Offering Document; assuming that each of the Indenture, the Offered Securities and the Registration Rights Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each party thereto (other than the Company) and that, in the case of the Offered Securities, the Offered Securities have been duly authenticated and paid for by the Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement, each of the Indenture, the Offered Securities and the Registration Rights Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;
     (v) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Offered Securities by the Company to the Purchasers and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, (i) any agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any such Significant Subsidiary is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company or any such Significant Subsidiary is subject or (ii) the charter or by-laws of the Company or any subsidiary, and the Company has full power and authority to authorize, issue and sell the Offered Securities as contemplated by this Agreement, except, in the case of clause (i) only, for any such breach, violation or default which would not have a Material Adverse Effect;
     (vi) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Offered Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Offering Document, will not be an "investment company" within the meaning of and subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act; and
     (vii) Such counsel has no reason to believe that the Offering Document or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Exchange Act Report, contained (as of its respective date and, in the case of the final Offering Document, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date) any untrue statement of a material fact or
 
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; the descriptions in the Offering Document and the Exchange Act Reports of legal and governmental proceedings and contracts and other documents are accurate in all material respects and fairly present in all material respects the information presented therein; it being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the financial statements or other financial data contained or incorporated by reference in the Offering Document and contained in the Exchange Act Reports or the statements in the Offering Document under the heading "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences."
     (d) The Purchasers shall have received from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel to the Company, an opinion, in the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto, and a disclosure letter, in the form of Exhibit B-2 hereto, each dated the Closing Date and each in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives.
     (e) The Purchasers shall have received from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, counsel for the Purchasers, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the incorporation of the Company, the validity of the Offered Securities, the Offering Document, the exemption from registration for the offer and sale of the Offered Securities by the Company to the several Purchasers and the resales by the several Purchasers as contemplated hereby and other related matters as the Representatives may require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
     (f) The Purchasers shall have received a certificate, dated the Closing Date, of the President or any Vice President and a principal financial or accounting officer of the Company in which such officers, to the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state that the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct, that the Company has complied with all agreements and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date, and that, at the Closing Date, since the date of this Agreement or subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements in the Exchange Act Reports there has been no material adverse change, nor any development or event involving a prospective material adverse change, in the financial condition, business, properties or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole except as set forth in or contemplated by the Offering Document or as described in such certificate.
     (g) The Purchasers shall have received a letter, dated the Closing Date, of KPMG LLP which meets the requirements of subsection (a) of this Section 6, except that (A) the specified date referred to in such subsection will be a date not more than three business days prior to the Closing Date for the purposes of this subsection and (B) such letter may be in the form of a "bring-down" letter.
     (h) The Purchasers shall have received a counterpart of the Registration Rights Agreement which shall have been executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of the Company.
 
     (i) The Indenture shall have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and the Trustee, and the Offered Securities shall have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and duly authenticated by the Trustee.
     The Company will furnish the Purchasers with conformed copies of such opinions, certificates, letters and other documents as the Purchasers reasonably request. The Representatives may in their sole discretion waive on behalf of the Purchasers compliance with any conditions to the obligations of the Purchasers hereunder.
     7. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Purchaser may become subject, under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Offering Document, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary offering circular or the Exchange Act Reports, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Purchaser for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Purchaser (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of a single counsel (in addition to any local counsel) to all Purchasers and any other indemnified persons in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings) in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Purchaser through the Representatives specifically for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the information described as such in subsection (b) below; and provided, further, that with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any preliminary offering circular, the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Purchaser that sold the Offered Securities concerned to the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, to the extent that such sale was an initial resale by such Purchaser and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Purchaser results from the fact that there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Offered Securities to such person, a copy of the Offering Document (exclusive of any material included therein but not attached thereto) if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to such Purchaser and any such untrue statement or omission was corrected in such Offering Document.
Indemnification and Contribution.
     (b) Each Purchaser will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Offering Document, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary offering circular, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
 
under which they were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Purchaser through the Representatives specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by any Purchaser consists of: (i) the last paragraph at the bottom of the cover page concerning the terms of the offering by the Purchasers, (ii) the legend concerning stabilization appearing in the third paragraph on page ii and (iii) and the information appearing in the ninth paragraph under the caption "Plan of Distribution".
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is prejudiced thereby. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (it being understood that, except with the consent of the indemnified party, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have separate counsel), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding without its consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on
 
the one hand and the Purchasers on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Purchasers from the Company under this Agreement. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Purchasers and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of a single counsel (in addition to any local counsel) to all Purchasers and any other indemnified persons in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings) reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Offered Securities purchased by it were resold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. The Purchasers' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations and not joint.
     (d) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; and the obligations of the Purchasers under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Purchasers may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.
     8. If any Purchaser or Purchasers default in their obligations to purchase Offered Securities hereunder and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities that such defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Offered Securities, the Representatives may make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons, including any of the Purchasers, but if no such arrangements are made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Purchasers shall be obligated severally, in proportion to their respective commitments hereunder, to purchase the Offered Securities that such defaulting Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase. If any Purchaser or Purchasers so default and the aggregate principal amount of Offered Securities with respect to which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount of Offered Securities and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Offered Securities by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Purchaser or the Company, except as provided in Section 9. As used in this Agreement, the term "Purchaser" includes any person substituted for a Purchaser under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Purchaser from liability for its default.
Default of Purchasers.
 
     9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the several Purchasers set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of any Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Offered Securities. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8 or if for any reason the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Purchasers is not consummated, the Company shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to Section 5 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Purchasers pursuant to Section 7 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Offered Securities by the Purchasers is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8 or the occurrence of any event specified in Section 6(b)(i) or in clause (C) (other than a suspension of trading of the securities of the Company), (D) or (E) of Section 6(b)(ii), the Company will reimburse the Purchasers for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Offered Securities.
Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     In connection with the several purchases today by you and the other Initial Purchasers named in Schedule I to the Purchase Agreement, dated November 15, 2004 (the "Purchase Agreement"), between Computer Associates International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and you, as Initial Purchasers named therein (the "Initial Purchasers"), of $500,000,000 principal amount of the Company's 4.750% Senior Notes due 2009 and $500,000,000 principal amount of the Company's 5.625% Senior Notes due 2014 (together, the "Securities") issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of November 18, 2004 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee"), we, as special counsel for the Company, have examined such corporate records, certificates and other documents, and such questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. Upon the basis of such examination, we advise you that, in our opinion:
     (1) The Company has been duly incorporated and is an existing corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
     (2) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company; the Securities have been duly authorized, executed, authenticated, issued and delivered; and the Indenture and the Securities constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.
     (3) The Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of November 18, 2004 (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), between the Company and you, as Initial Purchasers,
 
has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles; provided, however, that we express no opinion with respect to the indemnity provisions set forth in Section 5 of the Registration Rights Agreement.
     (4) The execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement, the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement by the Company, the issuance of the Securities in accordance with the Indenture and the sale of the Securities by the Company to you pursuant to the Purchase Agreement do not, and the performance by the Company of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement, the Indenture, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Securities will not, violate (i) the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, (ii) any Federal law of the United States, law of the State of New York or provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware applicable to the Company; provided, however, that, for the purposes of this paragraph, we express no opinion with respect to antifraud laws and fraudulent transfer laws; provided further that insofar as performance by the Company of its obligations under the Purchase Agreement, the Indenture, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Securities is concerned, we express no opinion as to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights.
     (5) The Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
     (6) Neither registration of the Securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, nor qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, is required for (i) the offer and sale of the Securities by the Company to you, or (ii) the reoffer and resale of the Securities by you, in each case (i) and (ii) in the manner contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and the Offering Circular, dated November 15, 2004, relating to the Securities. We express no opinion, however, as to when or under what circumstances any Securities sold by you may be reoffered or resold.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     This is with reference to the Offering Circular, dated November 15, 2004, and the documents incorporated by reference therein referred to under the caption "Incorporation of Certain Documents by Reference" (the "Referenced Documents"), relating to $500,000,000 principal amount of 4.750% Senior Notes due 2009 and $500,000,000 principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2014 (together, the "Securities") of Computer Associates International, Inc. (the "Company"). The Offering Circular and the Referenced Documents do not necessarily contain a current description of the Company's business and affairs since the Offering Circular provides information as of its date and the Referenced Documents contain information as of various dates.
     As special counsel to the Company, we reviewed the Offering Circular and the Referenced Documents and participated in discussions with your representatives and those of the Company and its accountants. Between the date of the Offering Circular and the time of the delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions with your representatives and those of the Company and its accountants concerning certain portions of the Offering Circular and reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Company, opinions addressed to you from the Company's counsel and a letter addressed to you from the Company's accountants. On the basis of the information that we gained in the course of the performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light of the experience we have gained through our practice in this field, we confirm to you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of such review has caused us to believe that the Offering Circular and the Referenced Documents, taken as a whole, as of the date of the Offering Circular, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. We also advise you that nothing that came to our attention in the course of the procedures described in the second sentence of this paragraph has caused us to believe that the Offering Circular and the Referenced Documents,
 
taken as a whole, as of the time of delivery of this letter, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     The limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and the character of determinations involved in the preparation of the Offering Circular are such, however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Offering Circular or the Referenced Documents, except for those made under the captions "Description of the Notes", "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations", "Exchange Offer; Registration Rights" and "Plan of Distribution" in the Offering Circular insofar as they relate to provisions of the documents or of the United States Federal tax law therein described. Also, we do not express any opinion or belief as to the financial statements or other financial data contained in the Offering Circular or the Referenced Documents.
     We are furnishing this letter to you, as Representatives of the several Initial Purchasers, solely for the benefit of the several Initial Purchasers in their capacity as such in connection with the offering of the Securities. This letter is not to be relied on by or furnished to any other person (including persons acquiring the Securities from the several Initial Purchasers) or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose.
Very truly yours,

The Initial Securities, the Additional Securities and the Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 1 to the Appendix, which is hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this Indenture. The Exchange Securities, the Private Exchange Securities and the Trustee's certificate of authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A, which is hereby incorporated by reference and expressly made a part of this Indenture. The Securities may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, rule of any securities exchange or over-the-counter market on which such Securities are then listed or quoted, or usage, which shall be provided by the Company in writing in addition to those set forth on the Appendix and Exhibit A. The Company and the Trustee shall approve the forms of the Securities and any notation, endorsement or legend on them in writing and the Company shall deliver to the Trustee in writing the form of such notation, endorsement or legend. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication. The terms of the Securities set forth in the Appendix and Exhibit A are part of the terms of this Indenture and, to the extent applicable, the Company and the Trustee, by their execution and delivery of this Indenture, expressly agree to be bound by such terms.
          SECTION 2.2 Execution and Authentication. Two Officers shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual or facsimile signature and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced.
 
          If an Officer whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates the Security, the Security shall be valid nevertheless.
          A Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the Trustee manually authenticates the Security. The signature of the Trustee on a Security shall be conclusive evidence that such Security has been duly and validly authenticated and issued under this Indenture.
          The Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Securities for original issue from time to time in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Appendix.
          The Trustee may appoint an agent (the "Authenticating Agent") reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate the Securities. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, any such Authenticating Agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such Authenticating Agent.
          SECTION 2.3 Registrar and Paying Agent. The Company shall maintain an office or agency where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the "Registrar") and an office or agency where Securities may be presented for payment (the "Paying Agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may have one or more additional paying agents. The term "Paying Agent" includes any such additional paying agent.
          In the event the Company shall retain any Person not a party to this Indenture as an agent hereunder, the Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with any Registrar or Paying Agent not a party to this Indenture, which shall incorporate the terms of the TIA. The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the name and address of each such agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation therefor pursuant to Section 7.7. The Company shall be responsible for the fees and compensations of all agents appointed or approved by it. The Company or any of its domestically incorporated wholly owned Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent.
          The Company initially appoints the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office as Registrar and Paying Agent for the Securities.
          SECTION 2.4 Paying Agent To Hold Money in Trust. By no later than noon (New York City time) on the date on which any Principal or interest (including any Additional Interest) on any Security is due and payable, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such Principal or interest (including any Additional Interest) when due. The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that such Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Securityholders or the Trustee all money held by such Paying Agent for the payment of Principal of or interest (including any Additional Interest) on the Securities and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. If the Company or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the
 
money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by such Paying Agent. Upon complying with this Section, the Paying Agent (if other than the Company or a Subsidiary) shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee. Upon any bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding with respect to the Company, the Trustee shall serve as Paying Agent for the Securities.
          SECTION 2.5 Securityholder Lists. The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of Securityholders. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall cause the Registrar to furnish to the Trustee, in writing at least five Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Securityholders.
          SECTION 2.6 Business Days. If a payment date is on a date that is not a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, and no interest shall accrue on such payment for the intervening period. If a regular record date is on a day that is not a Business Day, the record date shall not be affected.
          SECTION 2.7 Replacement Securities. If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Registrar or if the Holder of a Security shall provide the Company and the Trustee with evidence to their satisfaction that the Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code are met and the Holder satisfies any other reasonable requirements of the Trustee. In addition, such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Company and the Trustee to protect the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses in replacing a Security, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel. Every replacement Security is an additional obligation of the Company.
          SECTION 2.8 Outstanding Securities. Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled, those delivered for cancellation and those described in this Section 2.8 as not outstanding. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.
          If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.7, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.
          If the Paying Agent segregates and holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption date or maturity date money sufficient to pay all Principal and interest payable on that date with respect to the Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be, then on and after that date such Securities (or portions thereof) cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
 
          SECTION 2.9 Temporary Securities. Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities. After the preparation of definitive Securities, the temporary Securities shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities upon surrender of the temporary Securities at any office or agency maintained by the Company for that purpose and such exchange shall be without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor, one or more definitive Securities representing an equal principal amount of Securities. Until so exchanged, the Holder of temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as a Holder of definitive Securities.
          SECTION 2.10 Cancellation. The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer or exchange or payment. The Trustee and no one else shall cancel and destroy (subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act) all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange, payment or cancellation and deliver a certificate of such destruction to the Company. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities it has redeemed, paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, which shall not prohibit the Company from issuing Exchange Securities or Private Exchange Securities in exchange for Initial Securities and any Additional Securities.
          SECTION 2.11 Defaulted Interest. If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities, the Company shall pay defaulted interest plus interest on such defaulted interest to the extent lawful at the rate specified therefor in the Securities in any lawful manner. The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the Persons who are Securityholders on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special record date and payment date to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee which specified record date shall not be less than 10 days prior to the payment date for such defaulted interest and shall promptly mail or cause to be mailed to each Securityholder a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such defaulted interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when so deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Person entitled to such defaulted interest as provided in this Section 2.11.
          SECTION 2.12 CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders, provided, however, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be
 
placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.
          SECTION 3.1 Notices to Trustee. If the Company elects to redeem Securities pursuant to Section 5 of the Securities, it shall notify the Trustee in writing of the redemption date and the principal amount of Securities to be redeemed.
          The Company shall give each notice to the Trustee provided for in this Section at least 60 days (45 days in the case of redemption of all the Securities of any series) before the redemption date unless the Trustee consents to a shorter period. Such notice shall be accompanied by an Officers' Certificate from the Company to the effect that such redemption will comply with the conditions herein. The record date relating to such redemption shall be selected by the Company and set forth in the related notice given to the Trustee, which record date shall be not less than 15 days prior to the date selected for redemption by the Company.
          SECTION 3.2 Selection of Securities To Be Redeemed. If fewer than all the Securities of any series then outstanding are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Securities of such series to be redeemed by a method that complies with applicable legal and securities exchange requirements, if any, and that the Trustee considers to be fair and appropriate in accordance with methods generally used at the time of selection by fiduciaries in similar circumstances. The Trustee shall make the selection from outstanding Securities of such series not previously called for redemption. The Trustee may select for redemption portions of the principal of Securities that have denominations larger than U.S.$1,000. Securities and portions of them that the Trustee selects shall be in amounts of U.S.$1,000 or a whole multiple of U.S.$1,000. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption. The Trustee shall notify the Company of the Securities or portions of Securities to be redeemed. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article III, in the case of any Securities which are in book-entry form, the requirements and procedures of the related depositary (including without limitation the notice requirements and the selection process in the case of a partial redemption) shall apply.
          SECTION 3.3 Notice of Redemption. At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a date for redemption of Securities, notice of redemption shall be mailed by first-class mail to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed.
          The notice shall identify the Securities to be redeemed and shall state:
     (1) the redemption date;
     (2) the redemption price (or the method of calculating such price) and the amount of accrued interest to be paid, if any;
     (3) the name and address of the Paying Agent;
 
     (4) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any;
     (5) if fewer than all the outstanding Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the Bond No. (if certificated) and principal amounts of the particular Securities to be redeemed;
     (6) that, unless the Company defaults in making such redemption payment, interest on Securities (or portion thereof) called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date;
     (7) the CUSIP number, if any, printed on the Securities being redeemed; and
     (8) that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Securities.
     At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Company's name and at the Company's expense. In such event, the Company shall provide the Trustee with the information required by this Section 3.3.
     SECTION 3.4 Effect of Notice of Redemption. Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.3, Securities called for redemption shall become due and payable on the redemption date and at the redemption price as stated in the notice. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent on or after the redemption date, such Securities shall be paid at the redemption price stated in the notice, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date; provided that the Company shall have deposited the redemption price with the Paying Agent or the Trustee on or before noon (New York City time) on the date of redemption; provided, further, that if the redemption date is after a regular record date and on or prior to the interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest shall be payable to the Securityholder of the redeemed Securities registered on the relevant record date. Failure to give notice or any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the notice to any other Holder.
     SECTION 3.5 Deposit of Redemption Price. By no later than noon (New York City time) on the date of redemption, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or, if the Company or a Subsidiary is the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued and unpaid interest on all Securities to be redeemed on that date other than Securities or portions of Securities called for redemption which are owned by the Company or a Subsidiary and have been delivered by the Company or such Subsidiary to the Trustee for cancellation.
     Unless the Company defaults in the payment of such redemption price, interest on the Securities to be redeemed will cease to accrue on and after the applicable redemption date, whether or not such Securities are presented for payment.
     SECTION 3.6 Securities Redeemed in Part. Upon surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder thereof (at the Company's expense) a new Security of the same series, equal in a principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered.
 
          SECTION 4.1 Payment of Securities. The Company shall promptly pay the Principal of and interest (including Additional Interest) on the Securities on the dates and in the manner provided in the Securities and in this Indenture. Principal and interest (including Additional Interest) shall be considered paid on the date due if, on or before noon (New York City time) on such date, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or, if the Company or a Subsidiary is the Paying Agent, the segregated account or separate trust fund maintained by the Company or such Subsidiary pursuant to Section 2.4) holds in accordance with this Indenture money sufficient to pay all Principal and interest (including Additional Interest) then due. If any Additional Interest is due, the Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee setting forth the Additional Interest per U.S.$1,000 aggregate principal amount of Securities.
          The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate specified therefor in the Securities, and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the same rate to the extent lawful as provided in Section 2.11.
          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Indenture, the Company or the Paying Agent may, to the extent it is required to do so by law, deduct or withhold income or other similar taxes imposed by the United States of America or other domestic or foreign taxing authorities from Principal or interest payments hereunder.
          SECTION 4.2 Limitations on Liens. (a) So long as any Securities remain outstanding, the Company will not, nor will it permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, issue, incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money (hereinafter in this Article IV referred to as "Debt") secured by a mortgage, security interest, pledge, lien, charge or other encumbrance (mortgages, security interests, pledges, liens, charges and other encumbrances being hereinafter in this Article IV referred to as "mortgage" or "mortgages") upon any Principal Property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or upon any shares of stock or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary (whether such Principal Property, shares of stock or Debt are now existing or owed or hereafter created or acquired) without in any such case effectively providing, concurrently with the issuance, incurrence, creation, assumption or guaranty of any such secured Debt, or the grant of a mortgage with respect to any such Debt to be so secured, that the Securities (together with, if the Company shall so determine, any other indebtedness of or guarantee by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary ranking equally with the Securities) shall be secured equally and ratably with (or, at the Company's option, prior to) such Debt to be so secured; provided, however, that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to:
          (1) mortgages on property, shares of stock or indebtedness or other assets of any corporation existing at the time such corporation becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, provided that such mortgages or liens are not incurred in anticipation of such corporation becoming a Restricted Subsidiary;
          (2) mortgages on property, shares of stock or indebtedness existing at the time of acquisition thereof by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (which may
 
include property previously leased by the Company and leasehold interests thereon; provided that the lease terminates prior to or upon the acquisition) or mortgages thereon to secure the payment of all or any part of the purchase price thereof, or mortgages on property, shares of stock or indebtedness to secure any Debt incurred prior to, at the time of, or within 270 days after, the latest of the acquisition thereof, or, in the case of property, the completion of construction, the completion of improvements or the commencement of substantial commercial operation of such property for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price thereof, such construction or the making of such improvements;
          (3) mortgages securing Debt owing to the Company or to a Restricted Subsidiary;
          (4) mortgages existing on the Issue Date;
          (5) mortgages on property or other assets of a corporation existing at the time such corporation is merged into or consolidated with the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or at the time of a sale, lease or other disposition of the properties of a corporation as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, provided that such mortgage was not incurred in anticipation of such merger or consolidation or sale, lease or other disposition;
          (6) mortgages in favor of the United States of America or any State, territory or possession thereof (or the District of Columbia), or any department, agency, instrumentality or political subdivision of the United States of America or any State, territory or possession thereof (or the District of Columbia), to secure partial, progress, advance or other payments pursuant to any contract or statute or to secure any Debt incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price or the cost of construction or improvement of the property subject to such mortgages;
          (7) mortgages created in connection with a project financed with, and created to secure, a Nonrecourse Obligation;
          (8) mortgages securing all of the Securities; or
          (9) any extension, renewal or replacement (or successive extensions, renewals or replacements), in whole or in part, of any mortgage referred to in the foregoing clauses (1) to (8), inclusive, without increase of the principal of the Debt secured thereby; provided, however, that such extension, renewal or replacement shall be limited to all or a part of the property which secured the mortgage extended, renewed or replaced (plus improvements on such property).
          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4.2, the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary may (without equally and ratably securing the Securities) issue, incur, create, assume or guarantee Debt secured by mortgages which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions ("Exempted Secured Debt"), in an aggregate amount which, together with all other outstanding Debt of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries secured by mortgages which (if originally issued, incurred, created, assumed or guaranteed at such time)
 
would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions (not including such Debt which is permitted to be secured under any of clauses (1) through (9) above), does not at the time exceed 10% of Consolidated Net Assets of the Company.
          SECTION 4.3 Limitation on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions. (a) So long as any Securities remain outstanding the Company will not, nor will it permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any direct or indirect arrangement with any person that provides for the leasing to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of any Principal Property (except for such transactions (i) entered into prior to the Issue Date; (ii) between the Company and a Restricted Subsidiary or between Restricted Subsidiaries; (iii) under which the rent payable pursuant to such lease is to be reimbursed under a contract with the United States Government or any instrumentality or agency thereof; (iv) involving leases for no longer than three years; or (v) in which the lease for the property or asset is entered into within 270 days after the later of the date of acquisition, completion of construction or commencement of full operations of such property or asset), which Principal Property has been or is to be sold or transferred by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary to such person (subject to such exceptions in the preceding clauses (i) through (v), such arrangement being referred to as a "Sale and Lease-Back"), unless:
          (1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled, pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.2, to issue, incur, create, assume or guarantee Debt secured by a mortgage upon such property at least equal in amount to the Attributable Debt in respect of such Sale and Lease-Back without equally and ratably securing the Securities; or
          (2) the proceeds of the sale of the Principal Property to be leased are at least equal to their fair market value and such proceeds are applied within 180 days of the effective date of such Sale and Lease-Back to the purchase, construction, development or acquisition of assets or to the repayment of indebtedness of the Company.
          (b) For the purposes of this Section 4.3, the term "Attributable Debt" with respect to a Sale and Lease-Back involving a Principal Property means, at the time of determination, the lesser of:
          (1) the fair value of the property which is the subject of such Sale and Lease-Back (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company); or
          (2) the present value of the total net amount of rent required to be paid under such Sale and Lease-Back during the remaining term thereof (including any renewal term or period for which such lease has been extended), discounted at the rate of interest set forth or implicit in the terms of such Sale and Lease-Back or, if not practicable to determine such rate, the weighted average interest rate per annum borne by the Securities of each series outstanding pursuant to this Indenture compounded semi-annually in either case as determined by the principal accounting or financial officer of the Company.
For purposes of this definition, rent shall not include amounts required to be paid by the lessee, whether or not designated as rent or additional rent, on account of or contingent upon
 
maintenance and repairs, insurance, taxes, assessments, water rates and similar charges. In the case of any lease which is terminable by the lessee upon the payment of a penalty, such net amount shall be the lesser of (i) the net amount determined assuming termination upon the first date such lease may be terminated (in which case the net amount shall also include the amount of the penalty, but no rent shall be considered as required to be paid under such lease subsequent to the first date upon which it may be so terminated) or (ii) the net amount determined assuming no such termination.
          SECTION 4.4 Compliance Certificate. The Company shall deliver to the Trustee within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company an Officers' Certificate signed by the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer or the principal accounting officer stating that in the course of the performance by the signers of their duties as Officers of the Company they would normally have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default and whether or not the signers know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during such period. If they do, the certificate shall describe the Default or Event of Default, its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto. The Company also shall comply with TIA  314(a)(4).
          SECTION 4.5 Further Instruments and Acts. Upon reasonable request of the Trustee, the Company will execute and deliver such further instruments and do such further acts as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out more effectively the purpose of this Indenture.
          SECTION 4.6 Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Company shall maintain the office or agency required under Section 2.3. The Company shall give prior written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the address of the Trustee set forth in Section 10.2.
          SECTION 4.7 Corporate Existence. Except as otherwise permitted by Article V, the Company shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence.
          SECTION 4.8 SEC Reports. The Company will comply with all the applicable provisions of TIA  314(a).
          SECTION 4.9 Additional Interest Notice. In the event that the Company is required to pay Additional Interest to any Holder pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will provide notice to the Trustee of its obligation to pay Additional Interest as soon as practicable prior to the proposed payment date for the Additional Interest.
          SECTION 5.1 When the Company May Merge or Transfer Assets. The Company will not consolidate with or sell, lease or convey its assets as, or substantially as, an
 
entirety, to, or merge with or into, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, any other Person, unless:
     (i) the Company shall be the continuing entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "Successor") shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and the Successor (if not the Company) shall expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company under the Securities and this Indenture;
     (ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and
     (iii) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with this Indenture and that such supplemental indenture constitutes the legal valid and binding obligation of the Company subject to customary exceptions.
          Upon any consolidation or merger, or any sale or lease of the assets of the Company as, or substantially as, an entirety in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, the entity formed by such consolidation or into which the Company shall have been merged or to which such sale or lease shall have been made shall succeed to and be substituted for the Company with the same effect as if it had been named in the Indenture as a party thereto and thereafter from time to time such successor entity may exercise each and every right and power of the Company under the Indenture in the name of the Company or in its own name; and any act or proceeding by any provision of the Indenture required or permitted to be done by the Board of Directors or any Officer of the Company may be done with like force and effect by the like board (or other governing body) or officer (or comparable authorized person) of any entity that shall at the time be the successor of the Company hereunder. In the event of the sale by the Company of its assets as, or substantially as, an entirety upon the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company shall be released from all its liabilities and obligations under the Indenture and the Securities, but the predecessor Company in the case of a lease of all its assets or substantially all its assets will not be released from the obligation to pay the Principal of and interest on the Securities.
          SECTION 6.1 Events of Default. An "Event of Default" occurs with respect to any series of Securities if:
     (1) the Company defaults in any payment of interest on any Security of such series when the same becomes due and payable, and such default continues for a period of 30 days or more;
 
     (2) the Company defaults in the payment of the principal of any Security of such series when the same becomes due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon declaration or otherwise;
     (3) the Company fails to comply with any of its agreements in the Securities of such series or this Indenture as it relates to such series (other than those referred to in (1) or (2) above) and such failure continues for 90 days or more after the notice specified below;
     (4) the Company fails to make any payment at maturity, including any applicable grace period, in respect of obligations (other than the Securities of such series or non-recourse obligations) of the Company for borrowed money or evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or similar instruments ("Indebtedness") in an amount in excess of U.S.$50,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in any other currency or composite currency and such failure shall have continued for 30 days after the notice specified below;
     (5) a default with respect to any Indebtedness, which default results in the acceleration of Indebtedness in an amount in excess of U.S.$50,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in any other currency or composite currency without such Indebtedness having been discharged or such acceleration having been cured, waived, rescinded or annulled for a period of 30 days or more after the notice specified below;
     (6) the Company pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:
     (A) commences a voluntary case;
     (B) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case in which it is the debtor;
     (C) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for any substantial part of its property; or
     (D) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors; or or takes any comparable action under any foreign laws relating to insolvency; or
     (7) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:
     (A) is for relief against the Company in an involuntary case;
     (B) appoints a Custodian of the Company or for any substantial part of its property; or
     (C) orders the winding up or liquidation of the Company;
(or any similar relief is granted under any foreign laws) and the order, decree or relief remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive days.
 
          The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body.
          The term "Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11, United States Code, or any similar Federal or state law for the relief of debtors. The term "Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator, custodian or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.
          If any failure, default or acceleration referred to in clauses (4) or (5) above shall cease or be cured, waived, rescinded or annulled, then the Event of Default hereunder by reason thereof shall be deemed likewise to have been thereupon cured.
          A Default with respect to any series of Securities under clauses (3), (4) or (5) of this Section 6.1 is not an Event of Default with respect to such series until the Trustee (by notice to the Company) or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of such series (by notice to the Company and the Trustee) gives notice of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in said clause (3), (4) or (5) after receipt of such notice. Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a "Notice of Default".
          The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an Officers' Certificate of any event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would become an Event of Default under clause (3), (4) or (5) of this Section 6.1 and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
          SECTION 6.2 Acceleration. If an Event of Default with respect to any series of Securities (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(6) or (7)) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of such series by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the Principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Securities of such series to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such Principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(6) or (7) occurs and is continuing, the Principal of and accrued interest on all the Securities of such series shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of such series by notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree (other than a judgment or decree for the payment of Principal or interest or monies due on the Securities) and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of Principal or interest that has become due solely because of such acceleration and the Trustee has been paid all amounts due to it pursuant to Section 7.7. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
          SECTION 6.3 Other Remedies. If an Event of Default with respect to any series of Securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect
 
the payment of Principal of or interest on the Securities of such series or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities of such series or this Indenture.
     The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities of such series or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are, to the extent permitted by law, cumulative.
     SECTION 6.4 Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may waive any past or existing Default with respect to such series and its consequences except (i) a Default in the payment of the Principal of or interest on a Security of such series or (ii) a Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.2 cannot be amended without the consent of each Securityholder affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right.
     SECTION 6.5 Control by Majority. Upon provision of reasonable indemnity to the Trustee satisfactory to the Trustee, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series then outstanding may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee with respect to such series or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series. However, the Trustee, which may conclusively rely on opinions of counsel, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or, subject to Section 7.1, that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Securityholders of such series or any other series or would involve the Trustee in personal liability; provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction.
     SECTION 6.6 Limitation on Suits. A Holder of Securities of any series may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities of such series unless:
     (i) the Holder gives to the Trustee previous written notice stating that an Event of Default with respect to such series is continuing;
     (ii) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then outstanding make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;
     (iii) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability or expense;
     (iv) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and
 
     (v) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then outstanding do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request during such 60-day period.
     A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Securityholder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Securityholder.
     SECTION 6.7 Rights of Holders To Receive Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of Principal of and interest on the Securities held by such Holder, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Securities, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.
     SECTION 6.8 Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(1) or (2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the whole amount then due and owing (together with interest on any unpaid interest to the extent lawful) and the amounts provided for in Section 7.7.
     SECTION 6.9 Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The Trustee may file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Securityholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company, its creditors or its property and, unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, may vote on behalf of the Holders in any election of a trustee in bankruptcy or other Person performing similar functions, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and its counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.7.
     SECTION 6.10 Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money or property pursuant to this Article VI, it shall pay out the money or property in the following order:
     FIRST: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.7;
     SECOND: to Securityholders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities for Principal and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities for Principal and interest, respectively; and
     THIRD: to the Company.
     The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to Securityholders pursuant to this Section 6.10. At least 15 days before such record date, the Company shall mail to each Securityholder and the Trustee a notice that states the record date, the payment date and amount to be paid.
     SECTION 6.11 Undertaking for Costs. In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or
 
omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.7 or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any series.
     SECTION 6.12 Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. The Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) shall not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and shall not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
     SECTION 7.1 Duties of Trustee. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent Person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Person's own affairs.
     (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:
     (i) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
     (ii) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon Officers' Certificates and Opinions of Counsel furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture. However, in the case of any such Officers' Certificates and Opinions of Counsel which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall examine such Officers' Certificates and Opinions of Counsel to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but the Trustee need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).
     (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
     (i) this paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of this Section 7.1;
 
     (ii) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Trust Officer unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
     (iii) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.5.
     (d) Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section.
     (e) Money held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
     (f) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds to believe that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
     (g) Every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 7.1 and to the provisions of the TIA.
     SECTION 7.2 Rights of Trustee. (a) The Trustee may conclusively rely on any document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper person. The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.
     (b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel. The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on the Officers' Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.
     (c) The Trustee may act through agents or attorneys and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent or attorney appointed with due care.
     (d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers; provided, however, that the Trustee's conduct does not constitute willful misconduct or negligence.
     (e) The Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection, and the advice or opinion of counsel with respect to legal matters relating to this Indenture and the Securities shall be full and complete authorization and protection from liability in respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel.
     (f) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity
 
reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction.
     (g) The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any Default or Event of Default with respect to the Securities unless either (1) a Trust Officer shall have actual knowledge of such Default or Event of Default or (2) written notice of such Default or Event of Default shall have been received by a Trust Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture.
     (h) The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document unless required to do so by the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities at the time outstanding, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney, at the sole cost of the Company, and shall incur no liability of any kind by reason of such inquiry or investigation.
     (i) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other Person employed to act hereunder.
     (j) The Trustee may request that the Company deliver a certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture.
     SECTION 7.3 Individual Rights of Trustee. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-paying agent may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11.
     SECTION 7.4 Trustee's Disclaimer. The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Securities or any offering document, it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the Securities, and it shall not be responsible for any statement of the Company in this Indenture or in any document issued in connection with the sale of the Securities or in the Securities other than the Trustee's certificate of authentication.
     SECTION 7.5 Notice of Defaults. If a Default or an Event of Default occurs with respect to any series of Securities and is continuing and if it is known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder of such series notice of the Default within 90 days after it is actually known to a Trust Officer or written notice of it is received by a Trust Officer of the Trustee. Except in the case of a Default in payment of Principal of or interest on any Security,
 
the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is not opposed to the interests of Securityholders.
     SECTION 7.6 Reports by Trustee to Holders. If required and as promptly as practicable after each May 15 beginning with the May 15 following the date of this Indenture, and in any event prior to July 15 in each year, the Trustee shall mail to each Securityholder a brief report dated as of such May 15 that complies with TIA  313(a). The Trustee also shall comply with TIA  313(b). The Trustee shall promptly deliver to the Company a copy of any report it delivers to Holders pursuant to this Section 7.6.
     A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Securityholders shall be filed by the Trustee with the SEC and each stock exchange (if any) on which the Securities are listed. The Company agrees to notify promptly the Trustee whenever the Securities become listed on any stock exchange and of any delisting thereof.
     SECTION 7.7 Compensation and Indemnity. The Company shall pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation for its services as the Company and the Trustee shall from time to time agree in writing. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, including costs of collection, in addition to such compensation for its services, except any such expense, disbursement or advance as shall have been caused by its own negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee's agents and counsel. The Trustee shall provide the Company reasonable notice of any expenditure not in the ordinary course of business; provided that prior approval by the Company of any such expenditure shall not be a requirement for the making of such expenditure nor for reimbursement by the Company thereof. The Company shall indemnify each of the Trustee, its officers, directors, employees and any predecessor Trustees against any and all loss, damage, claim, liability or expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) (other than taxes applicable to the Trustee's compensation hereunder) incurred by it in connection with the acceptance or administration of this trust and the performance of its duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee so to notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder. The Company shall defend the claim and, if (in the opinion of counsel to the Trustee) the facts and/or issues surrounding the claim are reasonably likely to create a conflict with the Company, the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel to the Trustee. The Company need not reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Trustee through the Trustee's own willful misconduct, negligence or bad faith.
     To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section 7.7, the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee other than money or property held in trust to pay Principal of and interest on particular Securities.
     The Company's payment obligations pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and any discharge of this Indenture including any discharge
 
under any bankruptcy law. When the Trustee incurs expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.1(6) or (7) with respect to the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the Bankruptcy Law.
     SECTION 7.8 Replacement of Trustee. The Trustee may resign at any time with 30 days notice to the Company. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of any series then outstanding, may remove the Trustee with respect to such series with 30 days notice to the Trustee and may appoint a successor Trustee. The Company shall remove the Trustee if:
     (i) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;
     (ii) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent;
     (iii) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
     (iv) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.
     If the Trustee resigns, is removed by the Company or by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of any series and such Holders do not reasonably promptly appoint a successor Trustee with respect to such series, or if a vacancy exists in the office of Trustee for any reason (the Trustee in such event being referred to herein as the retiring Trustee), the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee.
     A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company and the Company shall pay all amounts due and owing to the Trustee under Section 7.7 of the Indenture. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Securityholders of any series affected by such resignation or removal. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.7.
     If a successor Trustee does not take office with respect to any series of Securities within 30 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in principal amount of the Securities of such series may petition (at the expense of the Company) any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
     If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Securityholder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
     Notwithstanding the replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.8, the Company's obligations under Section 7.7 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.
     SECTION 7.9 Successor Trustee by Merger. If the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all its corporate trust business or assets
 
to, another corporation or banking association, the resulting, surviving or transferee corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee, provided that such corporation shall be eligible under this Article VII and TIA Section 3.10(a).
     In case at the time such successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Securities shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee, and deliver such Securities so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor to the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.
     SECTION 7.10 Eligibility; Disqualification. The Trustee shall at all times satisfy the requirements of TIA  310(a). The Trustee shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least U.S.$50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. The Trustee shall comply with TIA  310(b); provided, however, that there shall be excluded from the operation of TIA  310(b)(1), with respect to any series, this Indenture with respect to any other series of Securities and any indenture or indentures under which other securities or certificates of interest or participation in other securities of the Company are outstanding if the requirements for such exclusion set forth in TIA  310(b)(1) are met.
     SECTION 7.11 Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company. The Trustee shall comply with  TIA 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA  311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA  311(a) to the extent indicated.
     SECTION 8.1 Discharge of Liability on Securities; Defeasance. With respect to any series of Securities, (a) when (i) the Company delivers to the Trustee all outstanding Securities of such series (other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.7) for cancellation or (ii) all outstanding Securities of such series have become due and payable, whether at maturity or as a result of the mailing of a notice of redemption pursuant to Article III hereof or the Securities of such series will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year, or the Securities of such series are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company, and, in each case of this clause (ii), the Company irrevocably deposits or causes to be deposited with the Trustee funds sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption all outstanding Securities of such series, including interest thereon to maturity or such redemption date (other than Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.7), and if in either case the Company pays all other sums payable hereunder by the Company, then this Indenture shall, subject to Section 8.1(c), cease to be of further effect with respect to such series. The Trustee shall acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to such series
 
on demand of the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel from the Company that all conditions precedent provided herein for relating to satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with and at the cost and expense of the Company.
     (b) Subject to Sections 8.1(c) and 8.2, the Company at any time may terminate (i) all of its obligations under the Securities of any series and this Indenture with respect to such series ("legal defeasance option") or (ii) its obligations under Sections 4.2 and 4.3 and the operation of Sections 6.1(3) (other than any obligations under Article V hereof), 6.1(4) and 6.1(5) with respect to such series ("covenant defeasance option"). The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option.
     If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option with respect to any series of Securities, payment of the Securities of such series may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Securities of such series may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in Section 6.1(3) (except with respect to obligations under Article V hereof), 6.1(4) or 6.1(5).
     Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth herein and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates.
     (c) Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, the Company's obligations in Sections 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, 4.1, 4.6, 4.7, 7.7, 7.8, 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6 of this Indenture and Section 2.3 of the Appendix with respect to such series shall survive until the Securities of such series have been paid in full. Thereafter, the Company's and the Trustee's obligations in Sections 7.7, 8.4 and 8.5 shall survive.
     SECTION 8.2 Conditions to Defeasance. The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option with respect to any series of Securities only if:
     (i) the Company irrevocably deposits or causes to be deposited in trust with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations which through the scheduled payment of Principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide cash at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay Principal and interest when due on all outstanding Securities of such series (except Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.7) to maturity or redemption, as the case may be;
     (ii) the Company delivers to the Trustee a certificate from a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants expressing their opinion that the payments of Principal and interest when due and without reinvestment on the deposited U.S. Government Obligations plus any deposited money without investment will provide cash at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay Principal and interest when due on all outstanding Securities of such series (except Securities replaced pursuant to Section 2.7) to maturity or redemption, as the case may be;
 
     (iii) 91 days pass after the deposit is made and during the 91-day period no Default specified in Section 6.1(6) or (7) occurs which is continuing at the end of the period;
     (iv) the deposit does not constitute a default under any other material agreement binding on the Company;
     (v) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;
     (vi) in the case of the legal defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (i) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Securityholders will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred;
     (vii) in the case of the covenant defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Securityholders of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred; and
     (viii) the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the defeasance and discharge of the Securities of such series as contemplated by this Article VIII have been complied with.
     Before or after a deposit, the Company may make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the redemption of Securities at a future date in accordance with Article III.
 
     SECTION 8.3 Application of Trust Money. The Trustee shall hold in trust money or U.S. Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to this Article VIII. It shall apply the deposited money and the money from U.S. Government Obligations either directly or through the Paying Agent as the Trustee may determine and in accordance with this Indenture to the payment of Principal of and interest on the Securities.
     SECTION 8.4 Repayment to Company. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly turn over to the Company upon request any excess money or securities held by them at any time.
     Subject to any applicable abandoned property law, the Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon written request any money held by them for the payment of Principal or interest that remains unclaimed for two years after the date of payment of such Principal and interest, and, thereafter, Securityholders entitled to the money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors.
     SECTION 8.5 Indemnity for Government Obligations. The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against deposited U.S. Government Obligations or the principal and interest received on such U.S. Government Obligations other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the defeased Securities; provided that the Trustee shall be entitled to charge any such tax, fee or other charge to such Holder's account.
     SECTION 8.6 Reinstatement. If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article VIII by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article VIII until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article VIII; provided, however, that, (a) if the Company has made any payment of interest on or Principal of any Securities following the reinstatement of their obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent and (b) unless otherwise required by any legal proceeding or any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall return all such money and U.S. Government Obligations to the Company promptly after receiving a written request therefor at any time, if such reinstatement of the Company's obligations has occurred and continues to be in effect.
     SECTION 9.1 Without Consent of Holders. The Company and the Trustee may amend this Indenture or the Securities without notice to or consent of any Securityholder:
 
     (i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;
     (ii) to comply with Article V;
     (iii) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated Securities; provided, however, that the uncertificated Securities are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code or in a manner such that the uncertificated Securities are as described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code;
     (iv) to add guarantees with respect to the Securities of all or any series;
     (v) to add security for the Securities of all or any series;
     (vi) to add to the covenants of the Company for the benefit of the Holders of all or any series of Securities or to surrender any right or power herein conferred upon the Company;
     (vii) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Securityholder; and
     (viii) to comply with any requirements of the SEC in connection with qualifying this Indenture under the TIA.
     After an amendment under this Section 9.1 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Securityholders of the applicable series a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Securityholders of such series, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section 9.1.
     SECTION 9.2 With Consent of Holders. The Company and the Trustee may amend this Indenture or the Securities without notice to any Securityholder but with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding of each series affected thereby (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange for Securities). However, without the consent of each Securityholder affected, an amendment may not:
     (i) reduce the amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
     (ii) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Security;
     (iii) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Security;
     (iv) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Security or change the time at which any Security may be redeemed in accordance with Article III;
     (v) make any Security payable in money other than that stated in the Security;
 
     (vi) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of Principal of and interest on such Holder's Securities on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder's Securities;
     (vii) make any changes that would affect the ranking for the Securities in a manner adverse to the Holders; or
     (viii) make any change in the second sentence of this Section 9.2.
     It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this Section 9.2 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
     After an amendment under this Section 9.2 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Securityholders of the applicable series a notice briefly describing such amendment. The failure to give such notice to all Securityholders of such series, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section 9.2.
     SECTION 9.3 Compliance with Trust Indenture Act. Every amendment to this Indenture or the Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.
     SECTION 9.4 Revocation and Effect of Consents and Waivers. A consent to an amendment or a waiver by a Holder of a Security shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of that Security or portion of the Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's Security, even if notation of the consent or waiver is not made on the Security. After an amendment or waiver becomes effective with respect any series of Securities, it shall bind every Securityholder of such series.
     The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Securityholders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Securityholders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date.
     SECTION 9.5 Notation on or Exchange of Securities. If an amendment changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Company shall provide in writing to the Trustee an appropriate notation to be placed on the Security regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determine, the Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment.
     SECTION 9.6 Trustee To Sign Amendments. The Trustee shall sign any amendment authorized pursuant to this Article IX if the amendment does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. If it does, the Trustee may but need not
 
sign it. In signing such amendment the Trustee shall be entitled to receive indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it and to receive, and (subject to Section 7.1) shall be fully protected in relying upon, in addition to the documents required by Section 10.4, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such amendment complies with the provisions of this Article IX and that such supplemental indenture constitutes the legal valid and binding obligation of the Company in accordance with its terms subject to customary exceptions.
     SECTION 9.7 Payment for Consent. Neither the Company nor any affiliate of the Company shall, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any Holder of a Security of any series for, or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture or the Securities unless such consideration is offered to be paid to all Holders of a Securities of such series that so consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.
     SECTION 10.1 Trust Indenture Act Controls. If any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision which is required to be included in this Indenture by the TIA, the provision required by the TIA shall control.
     SECTION 10.2 Notices. Any notice or communication shall be in writing and delivered in person or mailed by first-class mail addressed as follows:
     Any notices between the Company and the Trustee may be by facsimile, with telephone confirmation of receipt and the original to follow by guaranteed overnight courier. The Company or the Trustee by notice to the others may designate additional or different addresses for subsequent notices or communications.
 
     Any notice or communication mailed to a Securityholder shall be mailed to the Securityholder at the Securityholder's address as it appears on the registration books of the Registrar and shall be sufficiently given if so mailed within the time prescribed.
     Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Securityholder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Securityholders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.
     SECTION 10.3 Communication by Holders with other Holders. Securityholders may communicate pursuant to TIA  312(b) with other Securityholders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or the Securities. The Company, the Trustee, the Registrar and anyone else shall have the protection of TIA  312(c).
     SECTION 10.4 Certificate and Opinion as to Conditions Precedent. Upon any request or application by the Company to the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action under this Indenture, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee:
     (i) an Officers' Certificate in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee stating that, in the opinion of the signers, all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with; and
     (ii) an Opinion of Counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all such conditions precedent have been complied with.
     SECTION 10.5 Statements Required in Certificate or Opinion. Each certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a covenant or condition provided for in this Indenture shall include:
     (i) a statement that the individual making such certificate or opinion has read such covenant or condition;
     (ii) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are based;
     (iii) a statement that, in the opinion of such individual, he has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with; and
     (iv) a statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of such individual, such covenant or condition has been complied with.
     SECTION 10.6 When Securities Disregarded. In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Securities owned by the Company or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or
 
controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company (an "Affiliate") shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except that, for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Securities which a Trust Officer of the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Also, subject to the foregoing, only Securities outstanding at the time shall be considered in any such determination.

               (v) All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange pursuant to the terms of the Indenture shall evidence the same debt and shall be entitled to the same benefits under the Indenture as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.

     If the Company effects the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company will be entitled to close the Registered Exchange Offer 20 business days after the commencement thereof, provided that the Company has accepted all the Initial Securities theretofore validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Registered Exchange Offer.
     Following the declaration of the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Company shall promptly commence the Registered Exchange Offer, it being the objective of such Registered Exchange Offer to enable each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in Section 6 hereof) electing to exchange the Initial Securities for Exchange Securities (assuming that such Holder is not an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, acquires the Exchange Securities in the ordinary course of such Holder's business and has no arrangements with any person to participate in the distribution of the Exchange Securities and is not prohibited by any law or policy of the Commission from participating in the Registered Exchange Offer) to trade such Exchange Securities from and after their receipt without any limitations or restrictions under the Securities Act and without material restrictions under the securities laws of the several states of the United States.
     The Company acknowledges that, pursuant to current interpretations by the Commission's staff of Section 5 of the Securities Act, in the absence of an applicable exemption
 
therefrom, (i) each Holder which is a broker-dealer electing to exchange Securities, acquired for its own account as a result of market making activities or other trading activities, for Exchange Securities (an "Exchanging Dealer"), is required to deliver a prospectus containing the information set forth in (a) Annex A hereto on the cover, (b) Annex B hereto in the "Exchange Offer Procedures" section (or equivalent section) and the "Purpose of the Exchange Offer" section (or equivalent section) and (c) Annex C hereto in the "Plan of Distribution" section (or equivalent section) of such prospectus in connection with a sale of any such Exchange Securities received by such Exchanging Dealer pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer and (ii) an Initial Purchaser that elects to sell Exchange Securities acquired in exchange for Securities constituting any portion of an unsold allotment is required to deliver a prospectus containing the information required by Items 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, as applicable, in connection with such sale.
     The Company shall use its best efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective and to amend and supplement the prospectus contained therein, in order to permit such prospectus to be lawfully delivered by all persons subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act for such period of time as such persons must comply with such requirements in order to resell the Exchange Securities; provided, however, that (i) in the case where such prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto must be delivered by an Exchanging Dealer or an Initial Purchaser, such period shall be the lesser of 180 days and the date on which all Exchanging Dealers and the Initial Purchasers have sold all Exchange Securities held by them (unless such period is extended pursuant to Section 3(j) below) and (ii) the Company shall make such prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any resale of any Exchange Securities for a period of not less than 90 days after the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer.
     If, upon consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer, any Initial Purchaser holds Initial Securities acquired by it as part of its initial distribution, the Company, simultaneously with the delivery of the Exchange Securities pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer, shall issue and deliver to such Initial Purchaser upon the written request of such Initial Purchaser, in exchange (the "Private Exchange") for the Initial Securities held by such Initial Purchaser, a like principal amount of debt securities of the Company issued under the Indenture and identical in all material respects (including the existence of restrictions on transfer under the Securities Act and the securities laws of the several states of the United States, but excluding provisions relating to the matters described in Section 6 hereof) to the Initial Securities (the "Private Exchange Securities"). The Initial Securities, the Exchange Securities and the Private Exchange Securities are herein collectively called the "Securities".
     In connection with the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company shall:
     (a) mail to each Holder a copy of the prospectus forming part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, together with an appropriate letter of transmittal and related documents;
     (b) keep the Registered Exchange Offer open for not less than 20 business days (or longer, if required by applicable law) after the date notice thereof is mailed to the Holders;
 
     (c) utilize the services of a depositary for the Registered Exchange Offer with an address in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, which may be the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee;
     (d) permit Holders to withdraw tendered Securities at any time prior to the close of business, New York time, on the last business day on which the Registered Exchange Offer shall remain open; and
     (e) otherwise comply with all applicable laws.
     As soon as practicable after the close of the Registered Exchange Offer or the Private Exchange, as the case may be, the Company shall:
     (x) accept for exchange all the Securities validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer and the Private Exchange;
     (y) deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all the Initial Securities so accepted for exchange; and
     (z) cause the Trustee to authenticate and deliver promptly to each Holder of the Initial Securities, Exchange Securities or Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, equal in principal amount to the Initial Securities of such Holder so accepted for exchange.
     The Indenture will provide that the Exchange Securities will not be subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the Indenture and that all the Securities of each series will vote and consent together on all matters as one class and that none of the Securities of a particular series will have the right to vote or consent as a class separate from one another on any matter.
     Interest on each Exchange Security and Private Exchange Security issued pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer and in the Private Exchange will accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest was paid on the Initial Securities surrendered in exchange therefor or, if no interest has been paid on the Initial Securities, from the date of original issue of the Initial Securities.
     Each Holder participating in the Registered Exchange Offer shall be required to represent to the Company that at the time of the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer (i) any Exchange Securities received by such Holder will be acquired in the ordinary course of business, (ii) such Holder will have no arrangements or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the Securities or the Exchange Securities within the meaning of the Securities Act, (iii) such Holder is not an "affiliate," as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, of the Company or if it is an affiliate, such Holder will comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act to the extent applicable, (iv) if such Holder is not a broker-dealer, that it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, the distribution of the Exchange Securities and (v) if such Holder is a broker-dealer, that it will receive Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for Initial Securities that were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities and that it will be required to acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
 
     Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the Company will ensure that (i) any Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and any prospectus forming part thereof and any supplement thereto complies in all material respects with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) any Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (iii) any prospectus forming part of any Exchange Offer Registration Statement, and any supplement to such prospectus, does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     2. . If, (i) because of any change in law or in applicable interpretations thereof by the staff of the Commission, the Company is not permitted to effect a Registered Exchange Offer, as contemplated by Section 1 hereof, (ii) the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated within 340 days of the Issue Date (or, if not a business day, the first business day thereafter), (iii) any Initial Purchaser so requests with respect to the Initial Securities (or the Private Exchange Securities) not eligible to be exchanged for Exchange Securities in the Registered Exchange Offer and held by it following consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer or (iv) any Holder (other than an Exchanging Dealer) is not eligible to participate in the Registered Exchange Offer or, in the case of any Holder (other than an Exchanging Dealer) that participates in the Registered Exchange Offer, such Holder does not receive freely tradeable Exchange Securities on the date of the exchange, the Company shall take the following actions:
Shelf Registration
     (a) The Company shall, at its cost, as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than the later of (x) 60 days after so required or requested pursuant to this Section 2 and (y) 240 days after the Issue Date) file with the Commission and thereafter shall use its best efforts to cause to be declared effective (no more than the later of (x) 120 days after so required or requested pursuant to this Section 2 and (y) 310 days after the Issue Date) a registration statement (the "Shelf Registration Statement" and, together with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, a "Registration Statement") on an appropriate form under the Securities Act relating to the offer and sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities by the Holders thereof from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and Rule 415 under the Securities Act (hereinafter, the "Shelf Registration"); provided, however, that no Holder (other than an Initial Purchaser) shall be entitled to have the Securities held by it covered by such Shelf Registration Statement unless such Holder agrees in writing to be bound by all the provisions of this Agreement applicable to such Holder.
     (b) The Company shall use its best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective in order to permit the prospectus included therein to be lawfully delivered by the Holders of the relevant Securities, for a period of two years (or for such longer period if extended pursuant to Section 3(j) below) from the Issue Date or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement (i) have been sold pursuant thereto or (ii) are no longer restricted securities (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or any successor rule thereof).
 
The Company shall be deemed not to have used its best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the requisite period if it voluntarily takes any action that would result in Holders of Securities covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such Securities during that period, unless such action is required by applicable law.
     (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall cause the Shelf Registration Statement and the related prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, as of the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement, amendment or supplement, (i) to comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission and (ii) not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if the Company is required to file a Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Section 2, the Company may postpone or suspend the filing or effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplements thereto) (i) if such action is required by applicable law or (ii) for up to an aggregate of 60 days (but for not more than 30 consecutive days) during any consecutive 365 day period, if such action is taken by the Company in good faith and for valid business reasons (not including the avoidance of the Company's obligations hereunder), including the premature disclosure of material nonpublic information which, if disclosed at such time, would be materially harmful to the interests of the Company and its shareholders, so long as the Company promptly thereafter complies with the requirements of this Section 2. This Section 2(d) shall not affect the Company's obligations, if any, to pay Additional Interest pursuant to Section 6 of this Agreement.
     3. . In connection with any Shelf Registration contemplated by Section 2 hereof and, to the extent applicable, any Registered Exchange Offer contemplated by Section 1 hereof, the following provisions shall apply:

     (b) The Company shall give written notice to the Initial Purchasers, the Holders of the Securities and any Participating Broker-Dealer from whom the Company has received prior written notice that it will be a Participating Broker-Dealer in the Registered Exchange Offer (which notice pursuant to clauses (ii) through (v) hereof shall be accompanied by an instruction to suspend the use of the prospectus until the requisite changes have been made):
     (i) when the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto has been filed with the Commission and when the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto has become effective;
     (ii) of any request by the Commission for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the prospectus included therein or for additional information;

     (c) The Company shall make every reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal at the earliest possible time, of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.
     (d) The Company shall furnish to each Holder of Securities included within the coverage of the Shelf Registration, without charge, at least one copy of the Shelf Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and, if the Holder so requests in writing, all exhibits thereto (including those, if any, incorporated by reference).
     (e) The Company shall deliver to each Exchanging Dealer and each Initial Purchaser, and to any other Holder who so requests, without charge, at least one copy of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and, if any Initial Purchaser or any such Holder requests, all exhibits thereto (including those incorporated by reference).
     (f) The Company shall, during the Shelf Registration Period, deliver to each Holder of Securities included within the coverage of the Shelf Registration, without charge, as many copies of the prospectus (including each preliminary prospectus) included in the Shelf Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto as such person may reasonably request. The Company consents, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, to the use of the prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by each of the selling Holders of the Securities in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities covered by the prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, included in the Shelf Registration Statement.
     (g) The Company shall deliver to each Initial Purchaser, any Exchanging Dealer, any Participating Broker-Dealer and such other persons required to deliver a prospectus following the Registered Exchange Offer, without charge, as many copies of the final prospectus included in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto as such persons may reasonably request. The Company consents, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, to the use of the prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by any Initial Purchaser, if necessary, any Participating Broker-Dealer and such other persons required to deliver a prospectus following the Registered Exchange Offer in connection with the offering and sale of the Exchange Securities covered by the prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, included in such Exchange Offer Registration Statement.
     (h) Prior to any public offering of the Securities, pursuant to any Registration Statement, the Company shall register or qualify or cooperate with the Holders of the Securities included therein and their respective counsel in connection with the registration or qualification of the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or "blue sky" laws of such states of the United States as any Holder of the Securities reasonably requests in writing and do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the offer and sale in such jurisdictions of the Securities covered by such Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified
 
or (ii) take any action which would subject it to general service of process or to taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not then so subject.
     (i) The Company shall cooperate with the Holders of the Securities to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing the Securities to be sold pursuant to any Registration Statement free of any restrictive legends and in such denominations and registered in such names as the Holders may request a reasonable period of time prior to sales of the Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.
     (j) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by paragraphs (ii) through (v) of Section 3(b) above during the period for which the Company is required to maintain an effective Registration Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and file a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the related prospectus and any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to Holders of the Securities or purchasers of Securities, the prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If the Company notifies the Initial Purchasers, the Holders of the Securities and any known Participating Broker-Dealer in accordance with paragraphs (ii) through (v) of Section 3(b) above to suspend the use of the prospectus until the requisite changes to the prospectus have been made, then the Initial Purchasers, the Holders of the Securities and any such Participating Broker-Dealers shall suspend use of such prospectus, and the period of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement provided for in Section 2(b) above and the Exchange Offer Registration Statement provided for in Section 1 above shall each be extended by the number of days from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Initial Purchasers, the Holders of the Securities and any known Participating Broker-Dealer shall have received such amended or supplemented prospectus pursuant to this Section 3(j).
     (k) Not later than the effective date of the applicable Registration Statement, the Company will obtain CUSIP and ISIN numbers, and Common Codes, if applicable, for the Initial Securities, the Exchange Securities or the Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, and provide the applicable trustee with printed certificates for the Initial Securities, the Exchange Securities or the Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company.
     (l) The Company will comply with all rules and regulations of the Commission to the extent and so long as they are applicable to the Registered Exchange Offer or the Shelf Registration and will make generally available to its security holders (or otherwise provide in accordance with Section 11(a) of the Securities Act) an earning statement satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act, no later than 45 days after the end of a 12-month period (or 90 days, if such period is a fiscal year) beginning with the first month of the Company's first fiscal quarter commencing after the effective date of the Registration Statement, which statement shall cover such 12-month period.
 
     (m) The Company shall cause the Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), in a timely manner and containing such changes, if any, as shall be necessary for such qualification. In the event that such qualification would require the appointment of a new trustee under the Indenture, the Company shall appoint a new trustee thereunder pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Indenture.
     (n) The Company may require each Holder of Securities to be sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement to furnish to the Company such information regarding the Holder and the distribution of the Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably require for inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement, and the Company may exclude from such registration the Securities of any Holder that fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after receiving such request.
     (o) The Company shall enter into such customary agreements (including, if requested, an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take all such other action, if any, as any Holder of the Securities shall reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Securities pursuant to any Shelf Registration.
     (p) In the case of any Shelf Registration, the Company shall (subject to entering into customary confidentiality arrangements) (i) make reasonably available for inspection by the Holders of the Securities, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the Holders of the Securities or any such underwriter all relevant financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company and (ii) cause the Company's officers, directors, employees, accountants and auditors to supply all relevant information reasonably requested by the Holders of the Securities or any such underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with the Shelf Registration Statement, in each case, as shall be reasonably necessary to enable such persons, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act; provided, however, that the foregoing inspection and information gathering shall be coordinated on behalf of the Initial Purchasers by you and on behalf of the other parties, by one counsel designated by and on behalf of such other parties as described in Section 4 hereof.
     (q) In the case of any Shelf Registration, the Company, if requested by any Holder of Securities covered thereby, shall cause (i) its counsel (which may be its in-house counsel) to deliver an opinion and updates thereof relating to the Securities in customary form addressed to such Holders and the managing underwriters, if any, thereof and dated, in the case of the initial opinion, the effective date of such Shelf Registration Statement (it being agreed that such opinion may contain customary qualifications and assumptions and that the matters to be covered by such opinion shall include, without limitation, the due incorporation and good standing of the Company and its significant subsidiaries; the qualification of the Company and its significant subsidiaries to transact business as foreign corporations; the due authorization, execution and delivery of the relevant agreement of the type referred to in Section 3(o) hereof; the due authorization, execution, authentication and issuance, and the validity and enforceability, of the

     (s) If a Registered Exchange Offer or a Private Exchange is to be consummated, upon delivery of the Initial Securities by Holders to the Company (or to such other Person as directed by the Company) in exchange for the Exchange Securities or the Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, the Company shall mark, or caused to be marked, on the Initial Securities so exchanged that such Initial Securities are being canceled in exchange for the Exchange Securities or the Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be; in no event shall the Initial Securities be marked as paid or otherwise satisfied.
     (t) The Company will use its reasonable efforts to (i) if the Initial Securities have been rated prior to the initial sale of such Initial Securities, confirm such ratings will apply to the Securities covered by a Registration Statement, or (ii) if the Initial Securities were not previously rated, cause the Securities covered by a Registration Statement to be
 
rated with the appropriate rating agencies, if so requested by Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities covered by such Registration Statement, or by the managing underwriters, if any.
     (u) In the event that any broker-dealer registered under the Exchange Act shall underwrite any Securities or participate as a member of an underwriting syndicate or selling group or "assist in the distribution" (within the meaning of the Conduct Rules (the "Rules") of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD")) thereof, whether as a Holder of such Securities or as an underwriter, a placement or sales agent or a broker or dealer in respect thereof, or otherwise, the Company will assist such broker-dealer in complying with the requirements of such Rules, including, without limitation, by (i) if such Rules, including Rule 2720, shall so require, engaging a "qualified independent underwriter" (as defined in Rule 2720) to participate in the preparation of the Registration Statement relating to such Securities, to exercise usual standards of due diligence in respect thereto and, if any portion of the offering contemplated by such Registration Statement is an underwritten offering or is made through a placement or sales agent, to recommend the yield of such Securities, (ii) indemnifying any such qualified independent underwriter to the extent of the indemnification of underwriters provided in Section 5 hereof and (iii) providing such information to such broker-dealer as may be required in order for such broker-dealer to comply with the requirements of the Rules.

Registration Expenses
     5. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of the Securities, any Participating Broker-Dealer and each person, if any, who controls such Holder or such Participating Broker-Dealer within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, or any actions in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions relating to purchases and sales of the Securities) to which each indemnified party may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus relating to a Shelf Registration, or arise out of, or are based upon, the omission or alleged omission to state therein
Indemnification
 
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and shall reimburse, as incurred, the indemnified parties for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of a single counsel (in addition to any local counsel) to all indemnified parties collectively in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction) in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof; provided, however, that (i) the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in a Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus relating to a Shelf Registration in reliance upon and in conformity with written information pertaining to such Holder and furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion therein and (ii) with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in any preliminary prospectus relating to a Shelf Registration Statement, the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Securities concerned, to the extent that a prospectus relating to such Securities was required to be delivered by such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer under the Securities Act in connection with such purchase and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer results from the fact that there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Securities to such person, a copy of the final prospectus if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to such Holder or Participating Broker-Dealer and any such untrue statement or omission was corrected in such final prospectus; provided further, however, that this indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to such indemnified party. The Company shall also indemnify underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls such underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders of the Securities if requested by such Holders.
     (b) Each Holder of the Securities, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities or any actions in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus relating to a Shelf Registration, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information pertaining to such Holder and furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion therein; and, subject to the limitation set forth immediately preceding this clause, shall reimburse, as incurred, the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
 
liability or action in respect thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Holder may otherwise have to the Company or any of its controlling persons.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 5 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including a governmental investigation), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 5, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above, except to the extent the indemnified party is prejudiced thereby. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding without its written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may elect, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (it being understood that, except with the consent of the indemnified party, the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have separate counsel), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 5 for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation, subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other from the exchange of the Securities, pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer, or (ii) if the allocation provided by the foregoing clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Holder or such other indemnified party, as the case may be, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this
 
subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of a single counsel (in addition to any local counsel) to all indemnified parties collectively in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction) or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5(d), the Holders of the Securities shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such Holders from the sale of the Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds the amount of damages which such Holders have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this paragraph (d), each person, if any, who controls such indemnified party within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such indemnified party and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
     (d) The agreements contained in this Section 5 shall survive the sale of the Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     6. . (a) Additional interest (the "Additional Interest") with respect to the Initial Securities shall be assessed as follows if any of the following events occur (each such event in clauses (i) through (iv) below a "Registration Default"):
Additional Interest Under Certain Circumstances
     (i) If neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor a Shelf Registration Statement has been filed with the Commission on or prior to July 18, 2005;
     (ii) If neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor a Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective by the Commission on or prior to September 26, 2005;
     (iii) If the Registered Exchange Offer has not been consummated on or prior to October 24, 2005; or
     (iv) If after either the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective (A) such Registration Statement thereafter ceases to be effective during the period specified herein; or (B) such Registration Statement or the related prospectus ceases to be usable (except as permitted in paragraph (b) below) in connection with resales of Transfer Restricted Securities during the periods specified herein because either (1) any event occurs as a result of which the related prospectus forming part of such Registration Statement would include any untrue statement of a material fact or
 
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or (2) it shall be necessary to amend such Registration Statement or supplement the related prospectus, to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder.
Additional Interest shall accrue on the Initial Securities over and above the interest set forth in the title of the Securities at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90 days from and including the date on which any one or more of such Registration Defaults shall occur to but excluding the date on which all such Registration Defaults have been cured or, if any Registration Default has not been cured at or before the end of such 90-day period, at a rate of 0.50% per annum thereafter until all of such Registration Defaults have been cured; provided that the aggregate amount of Additional Interest under this Section 6(a) may not exceed 0.50% per annum.
     (b) A Registration Default referred to in Section 6(a)(iv)(B) hereof shall be deemed not to have occurred and be continuing in relation to a Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus if (i) such Registration Default has occurred solely as a result of (x) the filing of a post-effective amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement to incorporate annual audited financial information with respect to the Company where such post-effective amendment is not yet effective and needs to be declared effective to permit Holders to use the related prospectus or (y) other material events, with respect to the Company that would need to be described in such Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus and (ii) in the case of clause (y), the Company is proceeding promptly and in good faith to amend or supplement such Shelf Registration Statement and related prospectus to describe such events; provided, however, that in any case if such Registration Default occurs for a continuous period in excess of 30 days, Additional Interest shall be payable in accordance with the above paragraph from the day such Registration Default occurs until such Registration Default is cured.
     (c) Any amounts of Additional Interest due pursuant to clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (subject to Section 6(b) above) (iv) of Section 6(a) above will be payable in cash on the regular interest payment dates with respect to the Initial Securities. The amount of Additional Interest will be determined by multiplying the applicable Additional Interest rate by the principal amount of the Initial Securities, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such Additional Interest rate was applicable during such period (determined on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months), and the denominator of which is 360.
     (d) "Transfer Restricted Securities" means each Security until (i) the date on which such Transfer Restricted Security has been exchanged by a person other than a broker-dealer for a freely transferable Exchange Security in the Registered Exchange Offer, (ii) following the exchange by a broker-dealer in the Registered Exchange Offer of a Initial Security for an Exchange Note, the date on which such Exchange Note is sold to a purchaser who receives from such broker-dealer on or prior to the date of such sale a copy of the prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, (iii) the date on which such Initial Security has been effectively registered under the Securities Act and disposed of in accordance with the Shelf Registration Statement or (iv) the date on which such Initial Security is distributed to the public pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or is saleable pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act.
 
     7. . The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in a timely manner and, if at any time the Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder of Initial Securities, make publicly available other information so long as necessary to permit sales of their securities pursuant to Rules 144 and 144A. The Company covenants that it will take such further action as any Holder of Initial Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Initial Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rules 144 and 144A (including the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(4)). The Company will provide a copy of this Agreement to prospective purchasers of Initial Securities identified to the Company by the Initial Purchasers upon request. Upon the request of any Holder of Initial Securities, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed to require the Company to register any of its securities pursuant to the Exchange Act.
Rules 144 and 144A
     8. . If any of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by any Shelf Registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will administer the offering ("Managing Underwriters") will be selected by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Transfer Restricted Securities to be included in such offering, subject to the Company's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Underwritten Registrations
     No person may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's Transfer Restricted Securities on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
