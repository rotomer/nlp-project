Note 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
Description of Business and Organization
iLumin Software Services, Inc. ("iLumin" or "the Company") was  initially incorporated in the state of Utah on November 20, 1998, under the name "iLumin, Inc.", as a subsidiary of Intelliquest Technologies, Inc. ("Intelliquest").  On January 1, 1999, Intelliquest was merged into iLumin, which remained as the surviving corporation.  The Company was then incorporated in the state of Delaware in conjunction with a reorganization that moved its state of incorporation from the state of Utah.
 
The Company is a provider of comprehensive "Enterprise Message Management" software products and services that provide customers with intelligent enterprise message surveillance, archival, email security, encryption, and electronic signature services and solutions.
 
During 2002, the Company acquired two companiesEscrow.com and Assentorfor a combination of cash and stock (see Note 4). These acquisitions were consolidated into the operations of the Company from the date of acquisition.
 
During December 2003, the Company's management entered into plans for the sale of Escrow.com.  The Company reflected losses from discontinued operations for Escrow.com during the year ended December 31, 2004 up to the date of its sale to a third party in May 2004.  Discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 also reflects the income from operations of its Digital Suite Business, which was sold in November 2004, up to the date of its sale to a third party.
 
During January 2004, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Tumbleweed Communications Corp. for a combination of cash and stock (See Note 4).
 
The Company's operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties associated with technology-oriented companies including, among others, the susceptibility of the Company's products and services to rapid technological change, current and potential competitors with greater resources, dependence on significant customers, lack of operating history and uncertainty of future profitability and possible fluctuations in financial results.  The Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Computer Associates International, Inc. ("CA") on October 14, 2005 as result of an "Agreement and Plan of Merger" dated September 30, 2005.  Accordingly, Management believes that existing working capital, combined with the available resources from its new parent, will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations.
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents at September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004 consisted of investments in money market accounts and certificates of deposit.
 
Restricted Cash
that are restricted relating to two surety bonds required for the Company to do business in the states of Utah and California, a security deposit posted to the landlord of its Reston, VA office and a "Software License and Services Agreement" between the Company a customer.
Restricted cash consists of monies
 
The surety bonds are secured by letters of credit, in the amount of $50,000 each, which are secured by a security interest in all securities, cash, and other financial assets held in certain accounts.  In January 2005, the restricted cash related to California was paid directly to the state as a deposit and, therefore, is included in "Prepaid assets and other current liabilities", not as restricted cash at September 30, 2005.
 
During 2004, the Company entered into a "Software License and Services Agreement" with a customer.  This agreement called for the Company to deliver a letter of credit in the amount of $200,000, no later than July 15, 2004, that would allow the customer to draw upon the letter of credit for the sole purpose of maintaining the products in the event that the Company ceases to do business or support the products sold to them.  The letter of credit has a one-year term that automatically renews, unless the Company provides at least thirty-day written notice, to a maximum of five years.
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
 
The security deposit, pursuant to the "Deed of Lease" between the Company and the landlord of its corporate headquarters in Reston, VA, called for the Company to deliver an unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit in the face amount of $250,000.  This letter of credit is required to be issued for an effective period of time spanning the remainder of the lease term which expires in May 2009, otherwise, the Company must replace the letter of credit, at least 30 days prior to its expiration, with a new letter of credit in the same amount and upon the same terms as the original.  This amount is being reported as a noncurrent asset on the balance sheet.
 
Accounts Receivable
The Company reports accounts receivable inclusive of unbilled revenue and exclusive of data migration service income that has not yet been earned.  Unearned maintenance revenue that has been billed is included in the net balance reflected on the balance sheet.  The majority of customer balances are less than 61 days aged at both September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004.  The Company does not anticipate writing off balances in excess of the reserves that were established.
 
Concentrations of Credit Risk
(See Note 11 under "Legal Matters").
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions that may at times exceed federally insured limits.  The Company maintains its cash at high credit quality institutions and, as a result, believes credit risk related to its cash is minimal. The Company had two customers who accounted for 24% of consolidated revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and one customer who accounted for 16% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of the Company's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their carrying amount due to the relatively short maturity of these items.  The fair value of debt and capital lease obligations approximate their carrying amount as of September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, based on rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and maturities.
 
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
 
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to seven years.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life or remaining lease term.
 
Deferred Revenue
The "Deferred revenue" reported on the Company's balance sheets consists principally of payments received in advance of maintenance services rendered.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "(APB 25), and complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "(SFAS No. 123). Under APB 25, compensation expense is based on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant between the fair value of the Company's stock and the exercise price of the option.
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees"
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"
 
The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and EITF 96-18, Accordingly, the estimated fair value of the equity instruments is recorded on the earlier of the performance commitment date or the date the services required are completed.  In accordance with SFAS No. 148, " (SFAS 148), the effect on net loss if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation is as follows:
"Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods, or Services."  
Accounting for Stock-Based
CompensationTransition and Disclosure"
 
 
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
 
Pro forma information regarding net loss is required by FAS 123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under the Black-Scholes model of FAS 123.
 
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the provisions of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, ", as amended by SOP 98-4, ". SOP 97-2, as amended, generally requires revenues earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products, upgrades, enhancements, post-contract customer support (PCS), installation and training to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements.  The fair value of an element must be based on evidence that is specific to the Company.  If evidence of fair value does not exist for all elements of a license agreement including PCS, and PCS is the only undelivered element, then the Company recognizes revenue for the license arrangement ratably over the term of the agreement.  If evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements, then the Company recognizes revenues using the residual method.  Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue.
Software Revenue Recognition"
Deferral of the Effective Date Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions
"
 
Revenue from consulting services is recognized using the proportional performance method for fixed-fee development arrangements or as the services are provided for time-and-materials arrangements.
 
Research and Development
The Company expenses its research and development costs associated with the development of the Company's software product line.
 
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.  Advertising expenses were $895,619 and $728,164 for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and the year ended December 31, 2004, respectively.
 
Straight-Line Rent
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 13, entitled "Accounting for Leases", the Company recognizes rent concessions and stated increases in rent on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Accrued rent was $260,293 and $246,932 at September 30, 2005 and
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
 
December 31, 2004, respectively, and represents the cumulative liability that results from straight-lining the concessions and stated increases from the beginning of the lease for such facilities.  Rent expense included $354,613 and $394,014 attributed to straight-lined leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and the year ended December 31, 2004, respectively.
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Recoverability of Intangibles
The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.  The Company considers historical performance and anticipated future results in its evaluation of potential impairment.  Accordingly, when indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the carrying amounts of these assets in relation to the operating performance of the business and estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset.  No such impairment losses have been recognized to date.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision to SFAS No. 123, This revised Statement, SFAS No. 123r, entitled supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, and its related implementation guidance. It establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges equity instruments for goods and services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments or that may be settled by issuance of those equity instruments.  This Statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions.   This Statement does not change the accounting guidance for share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in Statement 123 as originally issued and EITF issue No. 96-18,  This Statement does not address the accounting for employee share ownership plans, which are subject to AICPA Statement of Position 93-6,  This Statement is effective for public entities that do not file as small business issuers as of the beginning of the first interim or annual period that begins after June 15, 2005.  The adoption of this Statement will have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of its operations.

liabilities of approximately $0.5 million.  This acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.  Accordingly, the operations of this acquired business are included in the Company's results from the date of acquisition.  Assets and liabilities acquired in connection with this acquisition were recorded at their estimated fair market values.  The Company assigned a two-year economic useful life for the acquired intangible assets and is amortizing the assets over that period.
 
Tumbleweed Communications Corp.
On January 13, 2004, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of Tumbleweed Communications Corp. ("Tumbleweed") in exchange for $100,000 in cash, approximately 369,000 common shares of iLumin, which equated to $119,999, and the assumption of $40,000 in liabilities.

settlement.  Approximately $8.0 million of net assets were acquired by the Company in connection with the acquisition, including intangible assets of approximately $2.8 million.  In addition, approximately $1.2 million of net liabilities were assumed by the Company.  This acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.  Accordingly, the operations of this acquired business were included in the Company's results of operations from the date of acquisition.  Assets and liabilities acquired in connection with this acquisition were recorded at their estimated fair market values.  The Company assigned a two-year economic useful life to the intangible assets and is amortizing the assets over that period.
 
During December 2003, the Company committed to sell all the assets of Escrow.com with a net book value of approximately $489,000.  On December 31, 2003, the Company determined that the plan of sale criteria in FASB Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," had been met.  Accordingly, the Company determined that the carrying value of the assets was equal to the fair value less costs to sell, based on the evaluation of the assets as of September 30, 2003.
 
On May 7, 2004, the Company entered into an "Agreement and Plan of Merger" with an independent third party whereby the Company sold Escrow.com for $200,000 in cash plus a promissory note.  The promissory note provided for a first installment due in November 2004 of $500,000 plus 10% interest and a performance payment equal to the greater of 1) $600,000 plus 10% interest per annum from the date of closing or 2) an amount equal to 25% of the Gross Margins of Escrow.com for the one-year period from the closing date, which took place on May 28, 2004.
 
In accordance with terms of the of the agreement described in the preceding paragraph the Company received the $200,000 at the closing and received $450,000 in September 2004 which was accepted by the Company in lieu of the $500,000 plus 10% interest due in November 2004 because the amount was remitted early by the "Buyer." Coincident to the one year period anniversary of the closing, in May 2005, the Buyer informed the Company of a dispute concerning the aggregate price it was required to pay the Company for the acquisition.  The Buyer and the Company entered into a "Settlement Agreement and Mutual General Release of All Claims" whereby the Company received a final payment from the Buyer of $225,000 in October 2005.  The Company has recorded a gain on the sale of Escrow.com of $732,281, reflected within "Discontinued Operations," during the year ended December 31, 2004, based upon the settlement-reduced aggregate sales price of $875,000, as follows:

On August 12, 2004, the Company agreed and accepted terms outlined in a memorandum of understanding from Silicon Valley Bank (the "Bank") concerning the Bank's intention to extend a $2,000,000 Revolving Line of Credit Facility ("Revolving Line") and a $1,000,000 Equipment Financing Facility ("Equipment Facility") to the Company pending the Bank's performing its due diligence and definitive loan documents being signed by the Bank and the Company.  A "Loan and Security Agreement" between the Bank and the Company was signed on September 23, 2004.
 
Advances made under the Revolving Line, which was to expire on September 22, 2005, were limited to the lesser of the $2,000,000 commitment or a borrowing base tied to eligible accounts receivable, with a sublimit of $1,000,000 to support the issuance of letters of credit, business credit cards, foreign exchange risk management and cash management services.  Advances under the Revolving Line were evidenced by a Revolving Promissory Note delivered by the Company to the Bank on the date the agreement was signed.  Advances received under this line bore interest at floating Prime plus .25%, with interest payable monthly.  Principal under the Revolving Line was payable at the maturity date, although the balance due for principal might be reduced to zero from time to time during the term of the line.
 
The "Loan and Security Agreement" provided for the Bank to make advances under the Equipment Facility, not exceeding the $1,000,000 commitment, through June 30, 2005 to finance or refinance equipment purchased, as defined in the agreement, by the Company. Equipment advances were to be repaid in 36 equal monthly installments of principal plus
 
NOTE 6  DEBT (continued)
 
accrued interest at Prime plus 1%, commencing on the first day of the month following the date the advance was made.
 
Borrowings under the "Loan and Security Agreement" were secured by substantially all the assets of the Company on a first priority basis, except for certain permitted liens such as equipment acquisitions not financed with the Bank or related to taxes, fees, assessments or other government charges.
 
The "Loan and Security Agreement" contained affirmative and negative covenant compliance requirements to be met by the Company, including financial covenant provisions.  The financial covenants included maintenance of an agreement defined monthly "quick ratio" and minimum quarterly EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) by the Company.  Other covenants involved, among other things, limits on Company distributions, investments and indebtedness, mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, and permission to make material changes in the business, management or its ownership.
 
On June 7, 2005, the Company entered into an "Intellectual Property Security Agreement" ("Intellectual Security") with the Bank, whereby the Company specifically granted a security interest in its intellectual property consisting of copyrights, patents and trademarks, and proceeds derived therefrom such as license royalties and infringement suits.  The Intellectual Security was granted coincident to the Company entering into a "Forbearance Agreement" with the Bank on the same date, whereby the Bank agreed to a forbearance of the default provisions of the Loan and Security Agreement triggered by the Company's failure to meet "Quick Ratio" compliances.  The forbearance period extended until July 31, 2005.  The Forbearance Agreement revised the Financial Covenant provisions and their measurement dates consistent with changing the maturity date of the Loan and Security Agreement to June 6, 2006, as well as resetting the borrowing base.
 
At December 31, 2004, the Company had not received any advances under the Revolving Line.  It drew down its first advance, in the amount of $515,000, under this line on March 23, 2005, and its indebtedness under this line was $2,000,000 at September 30, 2005.
 
The Bank had financed Company equipment purchases under the Equipment Financing Term Loan totaling $1,000,000 and $912,910

NOTE 10 - INCOME TAXES
 
The Company provides for income taxes based on the asset and liability method required by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.  Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
NOTE 10 - INCOME TAXES (continued)
 
Significant components of the Company's net deferred income taxes consists of the following as of:
 
 
FAS 109 requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  After consideration of all the evidence, management has determined that a full valuation allowance as of September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004 is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.
 
At September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the Company had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $109.9 million and $103.9 million, respectively.

NOTE 11 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
Operating Leases

NOTE 11 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (continued)
 
 
The new lease for facilities located in Reston, Virginia entered into in March 2004 provided for abatements of rent as follows: 100% abatement of monthly rent from the date of Company facility occupation in May through August 2004 of approximately $37,100 per month; and a $5,000 monthly rent abatement from September 2004 through September 2005.  The lease also provided for the landlord to reimburse up to $160,664 for construction of leasehold improvements made by the Company in making the premises ready for occupancy and use by it.  The cost of "Leasehold Improvements" capitalized during the year ended December 31, 2004 reflect a credit for the full reimbursement by the landlord of $160,664.
 
As a result of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, premises under a noncancelable operating lease in New Orleans, Louisiana became uninhabitable.  The above lease table excludes amounts due under the lease after August 2005, since the Company does not expect to be able to occupy the premises from that date until its expiration on March 31, 2006.  The Company also ceased paying the monthly rent of approximately $13,000 and stopped relieving the related liability (see Note 12) after August 2005.
 
Rent expense was approximately $541,000 and $951,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and the year ended December 31, 2004, respectively.
 
Employment Agreements
The Company has entered into employment contracts with certain of its Officers and other key employees for terms that cease in subsequent years with total annual minimum commitments as follows:
 
 
These contracts also provided for discretionary and performance bonuses and
severance under certain circumstances which, among other things, includes terminations after a
NOTE 11 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (continued)
Company "sale event."
 
To the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements no such Company sale related severance liability has been incurred that requires provision in the Company's financial statements. 
At December 31, 2004, accrued expenses includes $258,000 of
discretionary
and performance bonuses.  The Company incurred $300,000 of basic compensation under these agreements during the nine months ending September 30, 2005.
 
The above-tabled officer employment agreements and at-will employment agreements with two other key employees provided for an aggregate severance obligation of $537,500 in the event of termination without cause for these four individuals, none of whom have been terminated as of the date of issuance of these financial statements.  As a result of the CA acquisition of the Company described in Note 14, all of these individuals agreed to become at-will employees effective October 14, 2005.  The two officers will receive "stay bonuses" if they remain in the employ of the Company at dates that are 6 months and 12 months after the effective date, which stay periods have not yet been completed.   The other two employees have no such "stay bonus" arrangements.
 
Legal Matters
 
UBS/Renew Data Settlement
On November 24, 2005, the Company and one of its previously significant customers advised the judge in New York Supreme Court that a "settlement in principle" had been reached whereby that customer and the Company were in the process of drafting agreements whereby 2 lawsuits relating to Company work performed on a data migration project related to archived e-mail for the customer involving a significant Company subcontractor would be settled.  In principle, the three parties (the customer, the subcontractor and the Company) agreed that: 1) each of the parties would withdraw all claims and discontinue the lawsuits, 2) the customer would pay the subcontractor $250,000, 3) the Company also would pay the subcontractor $250,000, and 4) the Company would freeze the maintenance fee it was charging the customer for the Company's Assentor product for a period of one year.
 
The legal disputes arose out of contracts between the Company and the customer entered into in 2004, which called for delivery to the customer to take place in late 2004, and that the Company would be subject to financial penalties if it was unable to complete the project on time on December 10, 2004.  In that regard, the customer was to bear daily data storage charges from the Company's subcontractor up to the agreed delivery date. The project experienced significant delays involving disputes with the customer over their failure to provide data and information.  The project also experienced delays
NOTE 11 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (continued)
ascribed by the Company to the subcontractor's performance on the project and the Company asserted that the subcontractor repeatedly breached its contractual obligation not to directly communicate with the customer.  The subcontractor, on the other hand demanded payment for storage charges occurring after the project's due date of December 10, 2004.
 
Based on the "settlement in principle" reached between the parties on November 24, 2005, the Company has reflected the impact of the settlement as it relates to amounts billed by the Company to the customer as of December 31, 2004 within the consolidated financial statements for the year then ended, on the assumption that the parties will be able to finalize definitive written agreements that are consistent with the "settlement in principle."  The Company has also reflected the impact of the settlement with its subcontractor, that requires the Company to pay the settlement amount of $250,000, within the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004.
 
As a result of the legal dispute arising out of the contract entered into, iLumin recognized an overall loss on the contract.  This loss totals approximately $388,540 and is represented in entirety during the year ended December 31, 2004.  As of September 30, 2005, the remaining liability on the project is $250,000.
 
Accounts receivable included $0 and $1,010,315 owed to the Company by the customer, after giving effect to the "settlement in principle" as of September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.  The Company continues to do business with this customer who accounted for 4% of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 16% of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2004.
 
Accounts payable included $250,000 and $925,709 owed by the Company to the subcontractor as of September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. The Company no longer does business with this subcontractor.  The subcontractor provided services exclusively in connection with the services provided by the Company to the aforementioned customer, therefore, this will not materially impact the business operations.
NOTE 11 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (continued)
Other
The Company is subject to various other customer, vendor, personnel related and other claims and assessments during the normal course of business.  In the opinion of management, none of these matters, except as specifically described above, will result in a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial statements.  Accordingly, no liability has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to these type matters.
 
NOTE 12  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
 
During 2002, the Company approved a plan to terminate certain employees and to cancel an office lease facility in New Orleans, Louisiana.  At December 31, 2004, approximately $161,000 and $40,000 of accrued restructuring costs related to the lease termination were included in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the balance sheet, respectively.
 
During the nine months ended September 30, 2005, the Company made payments of approximately $106,000 for these restructuring charges and at September 30, 2005, approximately $94,000 and $0 of accrued restructuring costs related to the lease termination were included in current accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the balance sheet, respectively.
 
NOTE 13 - EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
 
Effective May 1, 2000, the Company adopted the iLumin Corporation 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan), which covers substantially all employees and allows them to defer up to 15% of their income, subject to IRS limitations. Under the terms of the 401(k) Plan, the Company makes discretionary matches of the employees' contributions, which vest over four years. For both the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company matched 100% of the first 3% of employee contributions, which totaled approximately $136,000 for each period.

1. Basis of Presentation
 
On August 1, 2005, Computer Associates International, Inc. ("CA") announced that the merger of Nebraska Acquisition Corp. ("Merger Sub"), a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of CA, with and into Niku Corporation ("Niku"), a Delaware corporation, was consummated on July 29, 2005 in accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of June 9, 2005, by and among CA, Merger Sub and Niku (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, Niku is now a wholly owned subsidiary of CA.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of common stock, $0.0001 par value, of Niku has been converted into the right to receive $21.00 in cash, without interest. The aggregate cash consideration paid by CA was approximately $337 million. Additionally, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase common stock of Niku, whether vested or unvested, has been assumed by CA and now represents an option to acquire shares of common stock of CA on the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
 
The total purchase price of the acquisition is as follows (in millions):
 
 
Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price as shown in the table above is allocated to Niku's net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of July 29, 2005. Management has allocated the purchase price based on various factors as described in the introduction to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The allocation of the purchase price based on Niku's balance sheet at April 30, 2005 and the estimated useful lives and first year amortization on an annualized basis associated with certain assets is as follows (in millions):
 
 
Approximately $42 million has been allocated to net tangible assets acquired. This amount reflects adjustments of certain Niku's assets and liabilities to fair value. Approximately $67 million has been allocated to amortizable intangible assets acquired. The amortization related to the amortizable intangible assets is reflected as pro forma adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations.
 
Identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of purchased software (developed and core technology), tradenames, customer contracts and relationships, and in-process research and development.
Identifiable intangible assets.
 
Purchased software relates to developed technology of Niku's products across all of their product lines that have reached technological feasibility and core technology related to a combination of Niku processes, patents and trade secrets developed through years of experience in design and development of their products.  CA will amortize the fair value of purchased software on a straight-line basis over an estimated life ranging from 3 to 6 years.
 
Customer contracts and relationships represent existing contracts that relate primarily to underlying customer relationships. CA will amortize the fair value of these assets on a straight-line basis over an average estimated life of 8 years.
 
Trade name relates to the Niku trade name, which CA will amortize on a straight-line basis over an estimated life of 7 years.
 
Approximately $226 million has been allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets. In accordance with the SFAS No. 142, , goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present). In the event that the management of the combined company determines that the value of goodwill has become impaired, the combined company will incur an accounting charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made.
Goodwill.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
Approximately $14 million has been allocated to in-process research and development and was charged to expense in CA's quarter ending September 30, 2005. Due to its non-recurring nature, the in-process research and development expense has been excluded from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations.
In-process research and development.
 
Niku is currently developing new products in multiple product areas that qualify as in-process research and development. Projects that qualify as in-process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility. Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to completion of a beta-phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development.
 
Niku is currently involved in numerous research and development projects, which are focused on developing new products, integrating new technologies, improving product performance and broadening features and functionalities. There is a risk that these development efforts and enhancements will not be competitive with other products using alternative technologies that offer comparable functionality.
 
The value assigned to in-process research and development was determined by considering the importance of each project to the overall development plan, estimating costs to develop the purchased in-process research and development into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value. The revenue estimates used to value the purchased in-process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by Niku and its competitors.
 
The rate utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value is based on Niku's weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital was adjusted to reflect the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility, the percentage of completion of each project, anticipated market acceptance and penetration, market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets.
 
The estimates used in valuing in-process research and development were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. Accordingly, actual results may vary from the projected results.
 
iLumin
 
On October 14, 2005, Computer Associates International, Inc. ("CA") announced that the merger of Lost Ark Acquisition, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of CA, with and into iLumin Software Services, Inc. ("iLumin"), a Delaware corporation, was consummated on October 14, 2005 in accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of September 30, 2005, by and among CA, Merger Sub and iLumin (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, iLumin is now a wholly owned subsidiary of CA.
 
The aggregate cash consideration paid by CA was approximately $47 million. Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price as shown in the table below is allocated to iLumin's net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of October 14, 2005. Management has allocated the purchase price based on preliminary estimates based on comparisons to prior similar acquisitions. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary pending the completion of various analyses and the finalization of estimates. The allocation of the preliminary purchase price based on iLumin's balance sheet at September 30, 2005 and the estimated useful lives and first year amortization on an annualized basis associated with certain assets is as follows (in millions):
 
 
A preliminary estimate of $(1) million has been allocated to net tangible liabilities acquired. This estimate reflects adjustments to certain iLumin assets and liabilities to fair value. A preliminary estimate of $12 million has been allocated to amortizable intangible liabilities acquired. The amortization related to the amortizable intangible assets is reflected as pro forma adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations.
 
Identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of purchased software (developed and core technology), tradenames, customer contracts and relationships, and in-process research and development.
Identifiable intangible assets.
 
Purchased software relates to developed technology of iLumin's products across all of their product lines that have reached technological feasibility and core technology related to a combination of iLumin processes, patents and trade secrets developed through years of experience in design and development of their products.  CA will amortize the fair value of purchased software on a straight-line basis over an estimated life ranging from 3 to 6 years.
 
Customer contracts and relationships represent existing contracts that relate primarily to underlying customer relationships. CA will amortize the fair value of these assets on a straight-line basis over an average estimated life of 8 years.
 
Trade name relates to the iLumin trade name, which CA will amortize on a straight-line basis over an estimated life of 7 years.
 
Approximately $34 million has been allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets. In accordance with the SFAS No. 142, , goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually (more frequently if certain indicators are present). In the event that the management of the combined company determines that the value of goodwill has become impaired, the combined company will incur an accounting charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made.
Goodwill.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
A preliminary estimate of $2 million has been allocated to in-process research and development and will be charged to expense in the quarter ending December 31, 2005. Due to its non-recurring nature, the in-process research and development expense has been excluded from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations.
In-process research and development.
 
2. Reclassifications
 
Certain reclassification adjustments have been made to conform Niku's and iLumin's historical reported balances to the pro forma combined condensed financial statement basis of presentation.
 
3. Period Adjustments
 
The four month period ended July 29, 2005 for Niku in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Statement of Operations was derived from the three month period ended April 30, 2005 (Niku's previous quarter end period) and results from the month ended July 29, 2005 (date of acquisition).
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Statement of Operation reflects certain adjustments have been made to reduce iLumin's nine month period ended September 30, 2005 results to a six month period ended September 30, 2005 results by subtracting results for the three month period ended March 31, 2005.
 
4. Pro Forma Adjustments
 
Pro forma adjustments are necessary to reflect the purchase price and allocation of such purchase price to Niku's and iLumin's net tangible and intangible assets at an amount equal to their estimated fair values, to reflect the amortization expense related to the estimated amortizable intangible assets for both Niku and iLumin as well as deferred stock-based compensation for Niku and iLumin in order to conform to CA's accounting for stock based compensation in accordance with FAS123(R), to reflect changes in interest expense from the reduction in CA's cash balance and to reflect the income tax effect related to the pro forma adjustments, if applicable.
 
Significant intercompany balances and transactions between CA and Niku as of the dates and for the periods of these pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been eliminated.
 
CA has not identified any pre-acquisition contingencies where the related asset, liability or impairment is probable and the amount of the asset, liability or impairment can be reasonably estimated. Prior to the end of the purchase price allocation period, if information becomes available which would indicate it is probable that such events have occurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, such items will be included in the purchase price allocation.
 
We estimate that revenues at our Niku and iLumin subsidiary for the twelve months following the consummation of the mergers will be reduced by approximately $5 million and $1 million, respectively, because the mergers were and will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.  Under the purchase method of accounting, deferred revenue was estimated based upon the direct costs of fulfilling the obligation, which includes direct Niku and iLumin costs as well as additional incremental direct costs that CA will expend, plus a normal profit margin.  The purchase method of accounting will not affect our revenues in periods subsequent to this twelve-month period.  This purchase accounting adjustment is non-recurring and has no impact on cash flows.
