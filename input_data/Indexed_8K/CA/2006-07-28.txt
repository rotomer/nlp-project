Item 5.04. Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans.
          As previously reported on its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 29, 2006, the Company suspended sales of shares of its common stock to its employees under its Savings Harvest Plan (the "Plan"), from 5:30 p.m. (ET) on Thursday, June 29, 2006 through 5:30 p.m. (ET) on Friday, July 28, 2006 (the "Suspension Period"). The Company is now extending the Suspension Period through 9:30 a.m. (ET) on Tuesday, August 1, 2006 (the "Extended Suspension Period"). During the Extended Suspension Period, directors and executive officers of the Company will not be permitted to purchase or sell any shares of Company common stock (unless, as required by law, certain conditions are met). On July 28, 2006, the Company gave notice of the Extended Suspension Period to its directors and executive officers, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
          The Company previously imposed the Suspension Period because it did not file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 (the "Form 10-K") by its extended due date of June 29, 2006. The Company is imposing the Extended Suspension Period because it expects to file its Form 10-K on July 31, 2006. As a result, the Company will not use its existing registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 to offer and sell Plan interests or the Company's common stock to employees until it has filed the Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
