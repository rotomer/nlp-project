Item 5.04. Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans.
     CA, Inc. (the "Company") intends to suspend its ability to sell shares of its common stock to its employees under the CA Savings Harvest Plan (the "Plan"), from 5:30 p.m. (ET) on Wednesday, August 9, 2006 through 9:30 a.m. (ET) on Tuesday, August 15, 2006 (the "Suspension Period"). During the Suspension Period, directors and executive officers of the Company will not be permitted to purchase or sell any shares of Company stock (unless, as required by law, certain conditions are met). These restrictions are required by Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. On August 7, 2006, the Company gave notice of the Suspension Period to its directors and executive officers, and a copy of the notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
     The Company is imposing the Suspension Period because it expects to defer filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the "Quarterly Report") for the fiscal period ended June 30, 2006, which would otherwise be due on August 9, 2006, for up to five calendar days as permitted by Rule 12b-25 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result of this deferral, on August 9, 2006 the Company will stop using its existing registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 to offer and sell Plan interests or the Company's common stock to employees until it has filed the Quarterly Report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Once it files the Quarterly Report, the Company will resume use of its registration statement to sell Plan interests and the Company's common stock to employees and will terminate the Suspension Period.
