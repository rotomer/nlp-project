Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
          On October 16, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement, dated as of October 16, 2006 (the "") between the Company and Mellon Investor Services LLC, as Rights Agent (the "") and declared a dividend of one right (a "") for each outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share ("") of the Company held of record at the close of business on October 26, 2006 (the ""), payable in respect of each such share upon the later of (i) certification by the New York Stock Exchange to the Securities and Exchange Commission that the Rights have been approved for listing and registration and (ii) November 30, 2006 (the ""), or issued thereafter and prior to the Separation Time (as defined below) and thereafter pursuant to options and convertible securities outstanding at the Separation Time. Each Right entitles its registered holder to purchase from the Company, after the Separation Time, one one-thousandth of a share of Participating Preferred Stock, Class A, without par value (""), for $100.00 (the ""), subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the New Rights Agreement.

          The Rights will be evidenced by the Common Stock certificates until the earlier of (either, the "") (i) the close of business on the tenth Business Day (as defined in the New Rights Agreement) (or such later date as the Board of Directors of the Company may from time to time fix by resolution adopted prior to the Separation Time that would otherwise have occurred) after the date on which any Person (as defined in the New Rights Agreement) commences a tender or exchange offer, which, if consummated, would result in such Person's becoming an Acquiring Person (as defined below) and (ii) the time of the first event causing a Flip-in Date (as defined below) to occur; , that if the foregoing results in the Separation Time being prior to the Payment Time, the Separation Time shall be the Payment Time; and that if a tender or exchange offer referred to in clause (i) above is cancelled, terminated or otherwise withdrawn prior to the Separation Time without the purchase of any shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto, such offer shall be deemed never to have been made. A Flip-in Date will occur on any Stock Acquisition Date (as defined below) or such later date and time as the Board of Directors of the Company may from time to time fix by resolution adopted prior to the Flip-in Date that would otherwise have occurred. A Stock Acquisition Date is defined as the earlier of (a) the first date on which the Company announces that a person or group has become an Acquiring Person or (b) the date and time on which any Acquiring Person has acquired more than 50% of the Common Stock. An Acquiring Person is defined as any Person having Beneficial Ownership (as defined in the New Rights Agreement) of 20% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, but shall not include (i) the Company; (ii) any Subsidiary (as defined in the New Rights Agreement) of the Company; (iii) any employee stock ownership or other employee benefit plan of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company (or any entity or trustee holding shares of Common Stock for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan or for the purpose of funding any such plan or funding other employee benefits for employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries); or (iv) any Person (A) who has Beneficial Ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of October 16, 2006 and who has continuously been since October 16, 2006 the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock until such time as such Person becomes the Beneficial Owner (other than through a stock split or a stock dividend) of an additional .1% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Mr. Walter Haefner and all of his Affiliates, Associates and Successors (as such terms are defined in the New Rights Agreement)); (B) who becomes the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock solely as a result of an acquisition by the Company of shares of Common Stock until such time as such Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of an additional .1% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock; (C) who becomes the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock but who (in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Company) acquired such Beneficial Ownership inadvertently and without any plan or intention to seek or affect control of the Company, if such Person promptly divests or promptly enters into an agreement to divest, sufficient securities of the Company so that such Person ceases to be the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, or (D) who Beneficially Owns shares of Common Stock consisting solely of one or more of (1) shares of Common Stock Beneficially Owned pursuant to the grant or exercise of an option granted to such Person (an "") by the Company in connection with an agreement to merge with, or acquire, the Company entered into prior to a Flip-in Date, (2) shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into, exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock) Beneficially Owned by such Option Holder or his Affiliates or Associates at the time of such grant, and (3) shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into, exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock) acquired by Affiliates or Associates of such Option Holder after the time of such grant which, in the aggregate, amount to less than 1% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock.
Separation Time

Option Holder
          The New Rights Agreement provides that, until the Separation Time, the Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Stock. Common Stock certificates issued after the Payment Time but prior to the Separation Time shall evidence one Right for each share of Common Stock represented thereby and shall contain a legend incorporating by reference the terms of the New Rights Agreement (as such may be amended from time to time). Notwithstanding the absence of the aforementioned legend, certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the Payment Time shall also evidence one Right for each share of Common Stock evidenced thereby. Promptly following the Separation Time, separate certificates evidencing the Rights (the "") will be delivered to holders of record of Common Stock at the Separation Time.
Rights Certificates
 
          The Rights will not be exercisable until the Business Day following the Separation Time. The Rights will expire on the earliest of (i) the Exchange Time (as defined below), (ii) November 30, 2009 (the "") and (iii) the date on which the Rights are redeemed as described below.
Expiration Time
          The Exercise Price and the number of Rights outstanding, or in certain circumstances the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights, are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution in the event of a Common Stock dividend on, or a subdivision or a combination into a smaller number of shares of, Common Stock, or the issuance or distribution of any securities or assets in respect of, in lieu of, or in exchange for, Common Stock.
          In the event that prior to the Expiration Time a Flip-in Date occurs, each Right (other than Rights Beneficially Owned by the Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate thereof, which Rights shall become void) shall constitute the right to purchase from the Company, upon the exercise thereof in accordance with the terms of the New Rights Agreement, that number of shares of Common Stock of the Company having an aggregate Market Price (as defined in the New Rights Agreement) equal to twice the Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the then-current Exercise Price. In addition, the Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time after a Flip-in Date and prior to the time that an Acquiring Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, elect to exchange all (but not less than all) the then outstanding Rights (other than Rights Beneficially Owned by the Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate thereof, which Rights shall become void) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date of the Separation Time (the ""). Immediately upon such action by the Board of Directors (the ""), the right to exercise the Rights will terminate, and each Right will thereafter represent only the right to receive a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio.
Exchange Ratio
Exchange Time
          Whenever the Company shall become obligated, as described in the preceding paragraph, to issue shares of Common Stock upon exercise of or in exchange for Rights, the Company, at its option, may substitute therefor shares of Participating Preferred Stock, at a ratio of one one-thousandth of a share of Participating Preferred Stock for each share of Common Stock so issuable.
          In the event that, prior to the Expiration Time, there exists an Acquiring Person that controls the Company's Board of Directors or Beneficially Owns 90% or more of the Common Stock, and the Company is involved in (i) a merger, consolidation or statutory share exchange (or enters into an agreement to undertake any of the foregoing) and either (A) such merger, consolidation or statutory share exchange is with the Acquiring Person or any Affiliate or Associate thereof or (B) any term of such merger, consolidation or share exchange relating to the treatment of capital stock of the Company Beneficially Owned by the Acquiring Person is not identical to the terms of such transaction relating to capital stock Beneficially Owned by other holders or (b) a sale of more than 50% of the Company's assets or earning power (each, a ""), each Right shall constitute the right to purchase from the Flip-over Entity (as defined in the New Rights Agreement), upon exercise of such right in accordance with the New Rights Agreement, that number of shares of common stock of the Flip-over Entity having an aggregate Market Price equal to twice the Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the Exercise Price.
Flip-over Transaction or Event
          The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time prior to a Flip-in Date, redeem all (but not less than all) the then outstanding Rights at a price of $0.001 per Right (the ""), as provided in the New Rights Agreement. Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors electing to redeem the Rights, without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and each Right will thereafter represent only the right to receive the Redemption Price in cash for each Right so held.
Redemption Price
          If the Company receives a Qualifying Offer (as defined below) and the Board of Directors does not redeem the Rights or exempt the Qualifying Offer from the requirements of the Rights Plan by the end of 90 Business Days following the commencement (or, if later, the first existence) of a Qualifying Offer, holders of at least 10% of the then outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock may demand that the Board take action necessary to arrange a special meeting of stockholders (the "") to vote on exempting the Qualifying Offer from the Rights Plan (the ""). If the Company receives a Special Meeting Demand within 90-120 Business Days following the commencement (or, if later, the first existence) of a Qualifying Offer, the Board shall take such actions as may be necessary to hold the Special Meeting within 90 Business Days of the Special Meeting Demand (the ""), provided that the Special Meeting Period may be extended if, prior to such vote, the Company enters into an agreement (that is conditioned on the approval by the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock) with respect to a merger, recapitalization, share exchange, or a similar transaction involving the Company or the direct or indirect acquisition of more than 50% of the Company's consolidated total assets (a ""), until the time of the meeting at which the stockholders will be asked to vote on the Definitive Acquisition Agreement.
Special Meeting
Special Meeting Demand
Special Meeting Period
Definitive Acquisition Agreement
 
          A Qualifying Offer must remain open for 120 Business Days and, if a Special Meeting Demand is delivered to the Board, for at least 10 Business Days after the date of the Special Meeting or, if no Special Meeting is held within the Special Meeting Period, for at least 10 Business Days following the end of such Period (the ""); , , that the Qualifying Offer need not remain open longer than (i) the expiration date of any other (x) Qualifying Offer (as such may be extended by public announcement); or (y) tender offer (as such may be extended by public announcement) with respect to which the Board has agreed to redeem the Rights immediately prior to acceptance of Common Stock for payment or (ii) one Business Day after the stockholder vote with respect to approval of any Definitive Acquisition Agreement has been officially determined and certified by the inspectors of elections. If the Special Meeting is not held within the Special Meeting Period (or if holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock vote in favor of exempting the Qualifying Offer from the Rights Plan at such meeting), the Qualifying Offer will be deemed to be exempt from the application of the Rights Plan on the close of business on the tenth business day after the results of such meeting are certified as official (or following the end of the Special Meeting Period, as applicable).
Qualifying Offer Period
provided
however
          A "" is defined as an offer that is determined by a majority of independent directors of the Company to have (among others) the following characteristics:
Qualifying Offer
(i) fully financed all-cash tender offer or an exchange offer offering shares of common stock of the offeror, or a combination thereof, for any and all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock at the same per-share consideration;
(ii) made by an offeror that, together with its Affiliates and Associates, beneficially owns no more than 5% of the Common Stock at the time the offer is commenced;
(iii) an offer not subject to any financing, funding or similar conditions or any requirements with respect to the offeror or its agents being permitted any due diligence on the Company;
(iv) offer pursuant to which the Company and its stockholders have received an irrevocable written commitment of the offeror that the offer will remain open for the Qualifying Offer Period as defined above;
(v) offer pursuant to which the Company has received an irrevocable written commitment by the offeror that the offer, if it is otherwise to expire prior thereto, will be extended for at least 15 Business Days after any increase in the price offered, and after any bona fide alternative offer is commenced, subject to the proviso set forth in the preceding paragraph;
(vi) if offer includes stock of the offeror, offeror must allow Company's investment bank, legal counsel and accountants to perform appropriate due diligence on the offeror's business;
(vii) offer conditioned on a minimum of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock being tendered and not withdrawn as of the offer's expiration date, which condition shall not be waivable;
(viii) offer pursuant to which the Company and its stockholders have received an irrevocable written commitment of the offeror to consummate as promptly as practicable upon successful completion of the offer a second-step transaction whereby all shares of the Common Stock not tendered into the offer will be acquired at the same consideration per share actually paid pursuant to the offer, subject to any stockholders' statutory appraisal rights;
(ix) offer pursuant to which the Company and its stockholders have received an irrevocable written commitment of the offeror that no amendments will be made to the offer to reduce the offer consideration, or otherwise change the terms of the offer in a way that is materially adverse to a tendering stockholder (other than extensions of the offer consistent with the terms thereof); and
(x) if offer includes stock of the offeror, (A) the stock portion of consideration must consist solely of common stock of the offeror, which must be a US corporation whose stock is freely and publicly traded and is listed on NYSE or admitted to trading on Nasdaq, (B) no shareholder approval is required or if required, has been obtained, (C) no Person beneficially owns more than 20% of the voting stock of the offeror, (D) no other class of voting stock of the offeror is outstanding and the offeror may register securities on Form S-3, and (E) the Company has received written representations and certification of the offeror and the offeror's CEO and CFO that all material facts about the offeror have been fully and accurately disclosed and new facts will be fully and accurately disclosed during the period during which the offer remains open, and all required Exchange Act reports will be filed by the offeror in a timely manner during the offer period.
          A committee of independent directors of the Company will evaluate the New Rights Agreement annually to determine whether it continues to be in the best interests of the stockholders or if the Rights should be redeemed.
          The holders of Rights will, solely by reason of their ownership of Rights, have no rights as stockholders of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
 
          The Rights will not prevent a takeover of the Company. However, the Rights may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires 20% or more of the Common Stock unless the Rights are first redeemed by the Board of Directors of the Company. Nevertheless, the New Rights Agreement should not interfere with a transaction that is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders because the Rights may be redeemed on or prior to the Flip-in Date, before the consummation of such transaction (including following the Special Meeting held in connection with a Qualifying Offer).
          As of September 30, 2006, there were 589,695,080 shares of Common Stock issued (of which 526,357,543 shares were outstanding and 63,337,537 shares were held in treasury). As long as the Rights are attached to the Common Stock, the Company will issue one Right with each new share of Common Stock so that all such shares of Common Stock will have Rights attached.
          The New Rights Agreement (which includes as Exhibit A the forms of Rights Certificate and Election to Exercise and as Exhibit B the form of Certificate of Designation and Terms of the Participating Preferred Stock) is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The press release announcing the adoption of the New Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The foregoing descriptions, as well as any descriptions contained in the attached press release, of the New Rights Agreement and the Rights are qualified in their entirety by reference to the New Rights Agreement and such exhibits thereto.

Legend on Common Stock Certificates
Until the Separation Time (as defined in the Rights Agreement referred to below), this certificate also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to certain Rights as set forth in a Rights Agreement, dated as of October 16, 2006 (as such may be amended from time to time, the "Rights Agreement"), between CA, Inc. (the "Company") and Mellon Investor Services LLC, as Rights Agent, the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is on file at the principal executive offices of the Company.

          (c) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at or after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time, the Rights (i) may be exercised and (ii) may be transferred independent of shares of Common Stock. Promptly following the Separation Time, the Rights Agent will mail to each holder of record of Common Stock as of the Separation Time (other than any Person whose Rights have become null and void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)), at such holder's address as shown by the records of the Company (the Company hereby agreeing to furnish copies of such records to the Rights Agent for this purpose), (x) a certificate (a "Rights

          (e) Upon receipt of a Rights Certificate, with an Election to Exercise accompanied by payment as set forth in Section 2.3(d), and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Rights Agent will thereupon promptly (i)(A) requisition from a transfer agent stock

requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and any other applicable law, rule or regulation, in connection with the issuance of any shares upon exercise of Rights; and (iii) pay when due and payable any and all federal and state transfer taxes and charges which may be payable in respect of the original issuance or delivery of the Rights Certificates or of any shares issued upon the exercise of Rights, , that the Company shall not be required to pay any transfer tax or charge which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the transfer or delivery of Rights Certificates or the issuance or delivery of certificates (or the registration) for shares in a name other than that of the holder of the Rights being transferred or exercised.

Rights shall be issued by the Company in respect of shares of Common Stock that are issued or sold by the Company after the Separation Time only to the extent provided in Section 5.3.

          (d) Rights Certificates shall represent the right to purchase the securities purchasable under the terms of this Agreement, including any adjustment or change in the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights, even though such certificates may continue to express the securities purchasable at the time of issuance of the initial Rights Certificates.
          2.5 . Each Person in whose name any certificate for shares is issued (or registration on the stock transfer books is effected) upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares represented thereby on the date upon which the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Exercise Price for such Rights (and any applicable taxes and other governmental charges payable by the exercising holder hereunder) was made; , , that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate (or registration) shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the stock transfer books of the Company are open.

          (b) If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Rights Agent prior to the Expiration Time (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Rights Certificate and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any of their agents harmless, then, subject to Sections 3.1(b), 3.1(c) and 5.1 and in the absence of written notice to the Company or the Rights Agent that such Rights Certificate has been acquired by a purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the Rights Agent shall countersign and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Rights Certificate, a new Rights Certificate evidencing the same number of Rights as did the Rights Certificate so destroyed, lost or stolen.
bona
fide
          (c) As a condition to the issuance of any new Rights Certificate under this Section 2.8, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Rights Agent) connected therewith. The Rights Agent shall have no duty or obligation to take any action under any Section of this Agreement which requires the payment by a Rights holder of applicable transfer taxes and/or governmental charges unless and until it is satisfied that all such taxes and/or governmental charges have been paid.
          (d) Every new Rights Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 2.8 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Rights Certificate shall evidence an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Rights Certificate shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and, subject to Section 3.1(b), shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Rights duly issued hereunder.
 
          2.9 . Prior to due presentment of a Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common Stock certificate or notice of transfer, if uncertificated) for registration of transfer, the Company, the Rights Agent and any agent of the Company or the Rights Agent may deem and treat the Person in whose name such Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, such Common Stock certificate or Common Stock registration, if uncertificated) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby for all purposes whatsoever, including the payment of the Redemption Price, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. As used in this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, the term "holder" of any Rights shall mean the registered holder of such Rights (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated shares of Common Stock).
Persons Deemed Owners
          2.10 . All Rights Certificates surrendered upon exercise or for registration of transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Rights Agent, be delivered to the Rights Agent and, in any case, shall be promptly cancelled by the Rights Agent. The Company may at any time deliver to the Rights Agent for cancellation any Rights Certificates previously countersigned and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Rights Certificates so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Rights Agent. No Rights Certificates shall be countersigned in lieu of or in exchange for any Rights Certificates cancelled as provided in this Section 2.10, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. The Rights Agent shall destroy all cancelled Rights Certificates and deliver to the Company a certificate attesting to such destruction.
Delivery and Cancellation of Certificates
 
          2.11 . Every holder of Rights by accepting the Rights, consents and agrees with the Company and the Rights Agent and with every other holder of Rights that:
Agreement of Rights Holders
          (a) prior to the Separation Time, each Right will be transferable only together with, and will be transferred by a transfer of, the associated share of Common Stock;
          (b) after the Separation Time, the Rights Certificates will be transferable only on the Rights Register as provided herein;
          (c) prior to due presentment of a Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common Stock certificate or Common Stock registration, if uncertificated) for registration of transfer, the Company, the Rights Agent and any agent of the Company or the Rights Agent may deem and treat the Person in whose name the Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common Stock certificate or Common Stock registration, if uncertificated) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary;
          (d) Rights Beneficially Owned by certain Persons will, under the circumstances set forth in Section 3.1(b), become void; and
          (e) this Agreement may be supplemented or amended from time to time pursuant to Section 2.4(b) or 5.4.
          3.1 . (a) In the event that prior to the Expiration Time a Flip-in Date shall occur, except as provided in this Section 3.1, each Right shall constitute the right to
Flip-in
 
purchase from the Company, upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms hereof (but subject to Section 5.10), that number of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Market Price on the Stock Acquisition Date that gave rise to the Flip-in Date equal to twice the Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the Exercise Price (such right to be appropriately adjusted in order to protect the interests of the holders of Rights generally in the event that on or after such Stock Acquisition Date any of the events described in Section 2.4(a) or (b), or any analogous event, shall have occurred with respect to the Common Stock).
          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Rights that are or were Beneficially Owned on or after the Stock Acquisition Date by an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate thereof, or by any transferee, direct or indirect, of any of the foregoing shall become void and any holder of such Rights (including transferees) shall thereafter have no right to exercise or transfer such Rights under any provision of this Agreement. If any Rights Certificate is presented for assignment or exercise and the Person presenting the same will not complete the certification set forth at the end of the form of assignment or notice of election to exercise and provide such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner and its Affiliates and Associates (or former Beneficial Owners and their Affiliates and Associates) as the Company shall reasonably request, then the Company shall be entitled conclusively to deem the Beneficial Owner thereof to be an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate thereof or a transferee of any of the foregoing and accordingly will deem the Rights evidenced thereby to be void and not transferable or exercisable.
          (c) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time after a Flip-in Date and prior to the time that an Acquiring Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, elect to exchange all (but not less
 
than all) the then outstanding Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1(b)) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right, appropriately adjusted in order to protect the interests of holders of Rights generally in the event that after the Separation Time any of the events described in Section 2.4(a) or (b), or any analogous event, shall have occurred with respect to the Common Stock (such exchange ratio, as adjusted from time to time, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Ratio").
          Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company electing to exchange the Rights, without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and each Right (other than Rights that have become void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)), whether or not previously exercised, will thereafter represent only the right to receive a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. Promptly after the action of the Board of Directors electing to exchange the Rights, the Company shall give written notice thereof (specifying the steps to be taken to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange for Rights) to the Rights Agent and the holders of the Rights (other than Rights that have become void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)) outstanding immediately prior thereto by mailing such notice in accordance with Section 5.9.
          Each Person in whose name any certificate for shares is issued (or for whom any registration on the stock transfer books of the Company is made) upon the exchange of Rights pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) or Section 3.1(d) shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares represented thereby on, and such certificate (or registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) shall be dated (or registered as of), the date upon which the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of any
 
applicable taxes and other governmental charges payable by the holder was made; , , that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate (or registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) shall be dated (or registered as of), the next succeeding Business Day on which the stock transfer books of the Company are open.
provided
however
          (d) Whenever the Company shall become obligated under Section 3.1(a) or (c) to issue shares of Common Stock upon exercise of or in exchange for Rights, the Company, at its option, may substitute therefor shares of Preferred Stock, at a ratio of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock for each share of Common Stock so issuable.
          (e) In the event that there shall not be sufficient treasury shares or authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock of the Company to permit the exercise or exchange in full of the Rights in accordance with Section 3.1(a) or if the Company so elects to make the exchange referred to in Section 3.1(c), the Company shall either (i) call a meeting of stockholders seeking approval to cause sufficient additional shares to be authorized ( that if such approval is not obtained the Company will take the action specified in clause (ii) of this sentence) or (ii) take such action as shall be necessary to ensure and provide, as and when and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and any agreements or instruments in effect on the Stock Acquisition Date (and remaining in effect) to which it is a party, that each Right shall thereafter constitute the right to receive, (x) at the Company's option, either in return for the Exercise Price, debt or equity securities or other assets (or a combination thereof) having a fair value equal to twice the Exercise Price, or without payment of consideration (except as otherwise required by applicable law), debt or equity securities or other assets (or a combination thereof) having a fair value equal to the Exercise Price, or (y) if the Board of Directors of the Company elects to exchange the Rights in accordance with Section 3.1(c), debt or equity securities or other assets (or a combination
provided
 
thereof) having a fair value equal to the product of the Market Price of a share of Common Stock on the Flip-in Date times the Exchange Ratio in effect on the Flip-in Date, where in any case set forth in (x) or (y) above the fair value of such debt or equity securities or other assets (or a combination thereof) shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with a nationally recognized investment banking firm.
          3.2 . (a) Prior to the Expiration Time, the Company shall not enter into any agreement with respect to, consummate or permit to occur any Flip-over Transaction or Event unless and until it shall have entered into a supplemental agreement with the Flip-over Entity, for the benefit of the holders of the Rights (the terms of which shall be reflected in an amendment to this Agreement entered into with the Rights Agent), providing that, upon consummation or occurrence of the Flip-over Transaction or Event (1) each Right shall thereafter constitute the right to purchase from the Flip-over Entity, upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms hereof, that number of shares of Flip-over Stock of the Flip-over Entity having an aggregate Market Price on the date of consummation or occurrence of such Flip-over Transaction or Event equal to twice the Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the Exercise Price (such right to be appropriately adjusted in order to protect the interests of the holders of Rights generally in the event that after such date of consummation or occurrence any of the events described in Section 2.4(a) or (b), or any analogous event, shall have occurred with respect to the Flip-over Stock) and (2) the Flip-over Entity shall thereafter be liable for, and shall
Flip-over
 
assume, by virtue of such Flip-over Transaction or Event and such supplemental agreement, all the obligations and duties of the Company pursuant to this Agreement.
          (b) Prior to the Expiration Time, unless the Rights will be redeemed pursuant to Section 5.1 pursuant to an agreement entered into by the Company prior to a Flip-in Date, the Company shall not enter into any agreement with respect to, consummate or permit to occur any Flip-over Transaction or Event if (i) at the time thereof there are any rights, warrants or securities outstanding or any other arrangements, agreements or instruments that would eliminate or otherwise diminish in any material respect the benefits intended to be afforded by this Rights Agreement to the holders of Rights upon consummation of such transaction, (ii) prior to, simultaneously with or immediately after such Flip-over Transaction or Event, the stockholders of the Person who constitutes, or would constitute, the Flip-over Entity shall have received a distribution of Rights previously owned by such Person or any of its Affiliates or Associates, or (iii) the form or nature of organization of the Flip-over Entity would preclude or limit the exercisability of the Rights.
          (c) The provisions of this Section 3.2 shall apply to successive Flip-over Transactions or Events.
          4.1 . (a) The Company hereby appoints the Rights Agent to act as agent for the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, and the Rights Agent hereby accepts such appointment. The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder and, from time to time, on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel fees and other disbursements incurred in the
General
 
administration and execution of this Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder. The Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability, damage, judgment, fine, penalty, claim, demand, settlement, cost or expense (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel), incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent (which gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction), for anything done or omitted to be done by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance and administration of this Agreement, including the costs and expenses of defending against any claim of liability.
          (b) The Rights Agent shall be authorized and protected and shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in connection with its administration of this Agreement or the exercise of its duties hereunder in reliance upon any certificate for securities (or registration on the stock transfer books of the Company) purchasable upon exercise of Rights, Rights Certificate, certificate for other securities of the Company, instrument of assignment or transfer, power of attorney, endorsement, affidavit, letter, notice, direction, consent, certificate, statement, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to be signed, executed and, where necessary, verified or acknowledged, by the proper Person or Persons. The Rights Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any event of which it was supposed to receive notice thereof hereunder, and the Rights Agent shall incur no liability for failing to take any action in connection therewith, unless and until it has received such notice.
          4.2 . (a) Any Person into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may be merged or with which
Merger, Consolidation or Change of Name of Rights Agent
 
it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent is a party, or any Person succeeding to the shareholder services business of the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent, will be the successor to the Rights Agent under this Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, that such Person would be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of Section 4.4. In case at the time such successor Rights Agent succeeds to the agency created by this Agreement any of the Rights Certificates have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Rights Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Rights Certificates have not been countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Rights Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Rights Certificates will have the full force provided in the Rights Certificates and in this Agreement.
provided
          (b) In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent is changed and at such time any of the Rights Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name and deliver Rights Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Rights Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such Rights Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name; and in all such cases such Rights Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Rights Certificates and in this Agreement.
 
     4.3 . The Rights Agent undertakes the duties and obligations imposed by this Agreement upon the following terms and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Rights Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:
Duties of Rights Agent
     (a) The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company or an employee of the Rights Agent), and the advice or opinion of such counsel will be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with such advice or opinion.
     (b) Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Agreement the Rights Agent deems it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by a person believed by the Rights Agent to be the Chairman of the Board, the President or any Vice President and by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer of the Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate will be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent and the Rights Agent shall incur no liability for any action taken, suffered or omitted in good faith by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.
     (c) The Rights Agent will be liable hereunder only for its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct (which gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Rights Agent be liable for special, punitive, indirect, consequential or incidental loss or damage
 
of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, lost profits)even if the Rights Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage. Any and all liability of the Rights Agent under this Agreement will be limited to the amount of annual fees paid by the Company to the Rights Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
,
     (d) The Rights Agent will not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Agreement or in the certificates, if any, for securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights or the Rights Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and will be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
     (e) The Rights Agent will not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any certificate, if any, for securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights or Rights Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor will it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Rights Certificate; nor will it be responsible for any change in the exercisability of the Rights (including the Rights becoming void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)) or any adjustment required under the provisions of Section 2.4, 3.1 or 3.2 or responsible for the manner, method or amount of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights after receipt of the certificate contemplated by Section 2.4 describing any such adjustment); nor will it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights or any Rights Certificate or as to whether any securities purchasable upon exercise of
 
Rights will, when issued, be duly and validly authorized, executed, issued and delivered and fully paid and nonassessable.
     (f) The Company agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Agreement.
     (g) The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept advice or written instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from any person believed by the Rights Agent to be the Chairman of the Board, the President or any Vice President or the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Company, and to apply to such persons for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and such instructions shall be full authorization and protection to the Rights Agent and the Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of any such person.
     (h) The Rights Agent and any stockholder, Affiliate, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent (in each case, other than an Acquiring Person) may buy, sell or deal in Common Stock, Rights or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal Person.
     (i) The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself (through directors, officers and employees) or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent will not be answerable
 
or accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company or any other Person resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, absent gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in the selection and continued employment thereof (which gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction).
     (j) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if it reasonably believes that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
     (k) If, with respect to any Rights Certificate surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the certificate attached to the form of assignment or form of election to purchase, as the case may be, has not been completed, the Rights Agent shall not take any further action with respect to such requested exercise or transfer without first consulting with the Company.
     4.4 . The Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon 30 days' notice (or such lesser notice as is acceptable to the Company) in writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent of Common Stock by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Rights in accordance with Section 5.9. The Company may remove the Rights Agent upon 30 days' notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Rights in accordance with Section 5.9. If the Rights Agent should resign or be removed or otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company will appoint a successor to
Change of Rights Agent
 
the Rights Agent. If the Company fails to make such appointment within a period of 30 days after such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of any Rights (which holder shall, with such notice, submit such holder's Rights Certificate for inspection by the Company), then the holder of any Rights may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be a Person organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any state of the United States, in good standing, which is authorized under such laws to exercise the powers of the Rights Agent contemplated by this Agreement and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent will be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company will file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Stock, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the holders of the Rights. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 4.4, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
 
     5.1 . (a) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time prior to the Flip-in Date, elect to redeem all (but not less than all) of the then outstanding Rights at the Redemption Price and the Company, at its option, may pay the Redemption Price either in cash or shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company deemed by the Board of Directors, in the exercise of its sole discretion, to be at least equivalent in value to the Redemption Price.
Redemption
     (b) A committee of independent directors of the Company will evaluate the Agreement annually to determine whether it continues to be in the best interests of the Company's stockholders or, rather, if the Rights should be redeemed.
     (c) In the event the Company receives a Qualifying Offer and the Board of Directors has not redeemed the outstanding Rights or exempted such offer from the terms of the Agreement or called a special meeting of stockholders by the end of the 90 Business Days following the commencement (or, if later, the first existence) of a Qualifying Offer, for the purpose of voting on whether or not to exempt such Qualifying Offer from the terms of this Agreement, holders of record (or their duly authorized proxy) of at least 10% of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding may submit to the Board of Directors, not earlier than 90 Business Days nor later than 120 Business Days following the commencement (or, if later, the first existence) of such Qualifying Offer, a written demand complying with the terms of this Section 5.1(c) (the "Special Meeting Demand") directing the Board of Directors of the Company to submit to a vote of stockholders at a special meeting of the stockholders of the Company (a "Special Meeting") a resolution exempting such Qualifying Offer from the provisions of this
 
Agreement (the "Qualifying Offer Resolution"). For purposes of a Special Meeting Demand, the record date for determining holders of record eligible to make a Special Meeting Demand shall be the 90 Business Day following commencement (or, if later, the first existence) of a Qualifying Offer. The Board of Directors of the Company shall take such actions as are necessary or desirable to cause the Qualifying Offer Resolution to be so submitted to a vote of stockholders at a Special Meeting to be convened within 90 Business Days following the Special Meeting Demand; , , that if the Company at any time during the Special Meeting Period and prior to a vote on the Qualifying Offer Resolution enters into a Definitive Acquisition Agreement, the Special Meeting Period may be extended (and any special meeting called in connection therewith may be cancelled) if the Qualifying Offer Resolution will be separately submitted to a vote at the same meeting as the Definitive Acquisition Agreement (the "Special Meeting Period"). A Special Meeting Demand must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive offices of the Company and must set forth as to the stockholders of record making the request (x) the names and addresses of such stockholders, as they appear on the Company's books and records, (y) the class and number of shares of Common Stock which are owned of record by each of such stockholders, and (z) in the case of Common Stock that is owned beneficially by another Person, an executed certification by the holder of record that such holder has executed such Special Meeting Demand only after obtaining instructions to do so from such beneficial owner and attaching evidence thereof. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, the Board of Directors of the Company may take a position in favor of or opposed to the adoption of the Qualifying Offer Resolution, or no position with respect to the Qualifying Offer Resolution, as it determines to be appropriate in the exercise of its duties. In the event that no Person has become an Acquiring Person prior to the redemption
th
provided

date referred to in this Section 5.1(c), and the Qualifying Offer continues to be a Qualifying Offer and either (i) the Special Meeting is not convened on or prior to the last day of the Special Meeting Period (the "Outside Meeting Date"), or (ii) if, at the Special Meeting at which a quorum is present, a majority of the shares of Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon as of the record date for the Special Meeting selected by the Board of Directors of the Company shall vote in favor of the Qualifying Offer Resolution, then the Qualifying Offer shall be deemed exempt from the application of this Agreement to such Qualifying Offer so long as it remains a Qualifying Offer, such exemption to be effective on the Close of Business on the tenth Business Day after (i) the Outside Meeting Date or (ii) the date on which the results of the vote on the Qualifying Offer Resolution at the Special Meeting are certified as official by the appointed inspectors of election for the Special Meeting, as the case may be (the "Exemption Date"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no action or vote, including action by written consent, by stockholders not in compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.1(c) shall serve to exempt any offer from the terms of this Agreement.
     (d) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company electing to redeem the Rights pursuant to Section 5.1(a) (or, if the resolution of the Board of Directors electing to redeem the Rights states that the redemption will not be effective until the occurrence of a specified future time or event, upon the occurrence of such future time or event), without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and each Right, whether or not previously exercised, will thereafter represent only the right to receive the Redemption Price in cash or securities, as determined by the Board of Directors. Promptly after the Rights are redeemed, the Company shall give notice of such redemption to the
 
Rights Agent and the holders of the then outstanding Rights by mailing such notice in accordance with Section 5.9.
     (e) Immediately upon the Close of Business on the Exemption Date, without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights with respect to the Qualifying Offer will terminate.
     5.2 . The Rights and this Agreement shall expire at the Expiration Time and no Person shall have any rights pursuant to this Agreement or any Right after the Expiration Time, except, if the Rights are exchanged or redeemed, as provided in Section 3.1 or 5.1, respectively.
Expiration
     5.3 . Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Rights Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in the number or kind or class of shares of stock purchasable upon exercise of Rights made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock by the Company following the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time pursuant to the terms of securities convertible or redeemable into shares of Common Stock (other than any securities issued or issuable in connection with the exercise or exchange of Rights) or to options, in each case issued or granted prior to, and outstanding at, the Separation Time, the Company shall issue to the holders of such shares of Common Stock, Rights Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with the issuance or sale of such shares of Common Stock; , , in each case, (i) no such Rights Certificate shall be issued, if, and to the extent that, the Company shall be advised by counsel that such issuance would create a
Issuance of New Rights Certificates

EXHIBIT B
     We, the undersigned, and , the and , respectively, of CA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), do hereby certify as follows:
                    
                    
                    
                    
          Pursuant to authority granted by Article FOURTH of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors of the Corporation has adopted the following resolutions fixing the designations and certain terms, powers, preferences and other rights of a new series of the Corporation's Preferred Stock, Class A, without par value, and certain qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon:
          RESOLVED, that there is hereby established a series of Preferred Stock, Class A, without par value, of the Corporation, and the designation and certain terms, powers, preferences and other rights of the shares of such series, and certain qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereon, are hereby fixed as follows:
               (i) The distinctive serial designation of this series shall be "Series Two Participating Preferred Stock" (hereinafter called "this Series"). Each share of this Series shall be identical in all respects with the other shares of this Series except as to the dates from and after which dividends thereon shall be cumulative.
               (ii) The number of shares in this Series shall initially be 600,000, which number may from time to time be increased or decreased (but not below the number then outstanding) by the Board of Directors. Shares of this Series purchased by the Corporation shall be cancelled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock undesignated as to series. Shares of this Series may be issued in fractional shares which are whole number multiples of one one-thousandth of a share, which fractional shares shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional share, to all rights of a holder of a whole share of this Series.
[
]
 
               (iii) The holders of full or fractional shares of this Series shall be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, but only out of funds legally available therefor, dividends, (A) on each date that dividends or other distributions (other than dividends or distributions payable in Common Stock of the Corporation) are payable on or in respect of Common Stock comprising part of the Reference Package (as defined below), in an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the aggregate amount of dividends or other distributions (other than dividends or distributions payable in Common Stock of the Corporation) that would be payable on such date to a holder of the Reference Package and (B) on the last day of March, June, September and December in each year, in an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the excess (if any) of $___ over the aggregate dividends paid per whole share of this Series during the three month period ending on such last day. Each such dividend shall be paid to the holders of record of shares of this Series on the date, not exceeding sixty days preceding such dividend or distribution payment date, fixed for the purpose by the Board of Directors in advance of payment of each particular dividend or distribution. Dividends on each full and each fractional share of this Series shall be cumulative from the date such full or fractional share is originally issued; that any such full or fractional share originally issued after a dividend record date and on or prior to the dividend payment date to which such record date relates shall not be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such dividend payment date or any amount in respect of the period from such original issuance to such dividend payment date.
1
provided
               The term "Reference Package" shall initially mean 1,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share ("Common Stock") of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the close of business on , (A) declare or pay a dividend on any Common Stock payable in Common Stock, (B) subdivide any Common Stock or (C) combine any Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then and in each such case the Reference Package after such event shall be the Common Stock that a holder of the Reference Package immediately prior to such event would hold thereafter as a result thereof.
                    
                    
2
               Holders of shares of this Series shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or stock, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided on this Series.
               So long as any shares of this Series are outstanding, no dividend (other than a dividend in Common Stock or in any other stock ranking junior to this Series as to dividends and upon liquidation) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution declared or made upon the Common Stock or upon any other stock ranking junior to this Series as to dividends or upon liquidation, unless the full cumulative dividends (including the dividend to be paid upon payment of such dividend or other distribution) on all outstanding
 
 
shares of this Series shall have been, or shall contemporaneously be, paid. When dividends are not paid in full upon this Series and any other stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with this Series, all dividends declared upon shares of this Series and any other stock ranking on a parity as to dividends shall be declared pro rata so that in all cases the amount of dividends declared per share of this Series and such other stock shall bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share on the shares of the Series and such other stock bear to each other. Neither the Common Stock nor any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to or on a parity with this Series as to dividends or upon liquidation shall be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any shares of any such stock) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for stock of the Corporation ranking junior to this Series as to dividends and upon liquidation), unless the full cumulative dividend (including the dividend to be paid upon payment of such dividend, distribution, redemption, purchase or other acquisition) on all outstanding shares of this Series shall have been, or shall contemporaneously be, paid.
               (iv) In the event of any merger, consolidation, reclassification or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the shares of this Series shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per whole share equal to the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, that a holder of the Reference Package would be entitled to receive as a result of such transaction.
               (v) In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of full and fractional shares of this Series shall be entitled, before any distribution or payment is made on any date to the holders of the Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to this Series upon liquidation, to be paid in full an amount per whole share of this Series equal to the greater of (A) $ or (B) the aggregate amount distributed or to be distributed in connection with such liquidation, dissolution or winding up to a holder of the Reference Package (such greater amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Liquidation Preference"), together with accrued dividends to such distribution or payment date, whether or not earned or declared. If such payment shall have been made in full to all holders of shares of this Series, the holders of shares of this Series as such shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation.
                    
3
               In the event the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to the holders of shares of this Series upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, shall be insufficient to pay in full all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section (v), no such distribution shall be made on account of any shares of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking on a party with the shares of this Series upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up unless proportionate distributive amounts shall be paid on account of the shares of this Series,
 
 
ratably in proportion to the full distributable amounts to which holders of all such parity shares are respectively entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.
               Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the holders of shares of this Series then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders all amounts to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section (v) before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior upon liquidation to this Series.
               For the purposes of this Section (v), the consolidation or merger of, or binding statutory share exchange by, the Corporation with any other corporation or entity shall not be deemed to constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.
               (vi) The shares of this Series shall not be redeemable.
               (vii) In addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as may be amended from time to time, of the Corporation, and except as otherwise required by law, each share (or fraction thereof) of this Series shall, on any matter, vote as a class with any other capital stock comprising part of the Reference Package and shall have the number of votes thereon that a holder of the Reference Package would have.
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have signed and attested this certificate on the day of , .
                    
                    
                    
                    
Attest:
                    
                    
                    

 
Exhibit 99.1
          ISLANDIA, N.Y., October 16, 2006  CA (NYSE: CA) today announced that its Board of Directors has unanimously adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Plan. In response to feedback from CA stockholders and to address corporate governance concerns associated with rights plans, CA will ask its stockholders to vote on its Rights Plan at its 2007 Annual Meeting.
          In connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan, the Company declared a dividend of one right on each outstanding share of CA's common stock. The dividend will be paid on November 30, 2006 upon expiration of CA's existing rights plan to stockholders of record on October 26, 2006. The Rights Plan was not adopted in response to any specific effort to acquire control of the Company and is not intended to prevent a takeover at a full and fair price.
          In addition to the customary "flip-in" and "flip-over" provisions, the Rights Plan includes a number of features adopted in response to recommendations by stockholders, including setting the threshold for triggering exercise of the Rights Plan at 20 percent of the outstanding shares rather than 15 percent; a fixed term for the Rights Plan of only three years instead of ten; and a provision requiring a committee of independent directors to assess annually whether the Rights Plan remains in the best interests of CA's stockholders. The Rights Plan also includes a provision that states that the Rights Plan will not be triggered by a "Qualifying Offer" if holders of at least 10 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock request that a special meeting of stockholders be convened for the purpose of exempting such offer from the Rights Plan, and thereafter the stockholders vote at such meeting to exempt such "Qualifying Offer" from the Rights Plan.
          "CA believes this Rights Plan, which has features similar to those approved by stockholders at other companies, strikes an appropriate balance
 
between empowering the Board of Directors to use a Rights Plan to increase its negotiating leverage to maximize stockholder value and the current best practices in corporate governance that give stockholders a voice in such process," said Lewis Ranieri, chairman of the Board of Directors. "The Qualifying Offer' provision of the Rights Plan provides our stockholders the ability to express their preference for or against the offer while also providing our Board with the time to attract and secure potentially superior alternatives to maximize stockholder value. In addition, the annual review of the Rights Plan by independent directors is intended to ensure that the Rights Plan only remains in place if it continues to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders."
          Additional details and a copy of the Rights Plan are included in a Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 16, 2006.

A number of important factors could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including: the risks and uncertainties associated with the CA deferred prosecution agreement with the United States Attorney's Office of the Eastern District, including that CA could be subject to criminal prosecution or civil penalties if it violates this agreement; the risks and uncertainties associated with the agreement that CA entered into with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including that CA may be subject to criminal prosecution or substantial civil penalties and fines if it violates this agreement; civil litigation arising out of the matters that are the subject of the Department of Justice and the SEC investigations, including shareholder derivative litigation; changes to the compensation plan of CA's sales organization may lead to outcomes that are not anticipated or intended as they are implemented, and the commissions plans for fiscal year 2007, while revised, continue to be reviewed; CA may not adequately manage and evolve its financial reporting and managerial systems and processes, including the successful implementation of its enterprise resource planning software; CA may encounter difficulty in
 
successfully integrating acquired companies and products into its existing businesses; CA is subject to intense competition in product and service offerings and pricing and increased competition is expected in the future; if CA's products do not remain compatible with ever-changing operating environments, CA could lose customers and the demand for CA's products and services could decrease; certain software that CA uses in daily operations is licensed from third parties and thus may not be available to CA in the future, which has the potential to delay product development and production; CA's credit ratings have been downgraded and could be downgraded further which would require CA to pay additional interest under its credit agreement and could adversely affect CA's ability to borrow; CA has a significant amount of debt; the failure to protect CA's intellectual property rights would weaken its competitive position; CA may become dependent upon large transactions; general economic conditions may lead CA's customers to delay or forgo technology upgrades; the market for some or all of CA's key product areas may not grow; third parties could claim that CA's products infringe their intellectual property rights; fluctuations in foreign currencies could result in translation losses; and the other factors described in CA's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. CA assumes no obligation to update the information in this communication, except as otherwise required by law. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date hereof.
