Item 8.01. Other Events
In February 2005, the Board of Directors of CA, Inc. ("CA" or the "Company") formed a Special Litigation Committee consisting of two non-management members of the Board of Directors (the "Special Litigation Committee"), whose purpose is to control and determine the Company's response to a consolidated amended derivative complaint filed on January 7, 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York ("New York Derivative Action"), and another later filed derivative complaint related to the same facts (collectively, the "Derivative Actions").
On April 13, 2007, the Special Litigation Committee issued its reports, which announced the Special Litigation Committee's conclusions, determinations, recommendations and actions with respect to the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions. The Special Litigation Committee also served a motion in the New York Derivative Action which seeks the Court's approval of the Special Litigation Committee's conclusions. The Special Litigation Committee concluded as follows:
 
 
There is no assurance that the courts adjudicating the claims in the Derivative Actions will accept the determinations made by the Special Litigation Committee. The Company undertakes no duty to provide updates on any such actions which may be taken by the Special Litigation Committee, CA, the attorneys representing the plaintiffs in the Derivative Actions, any of the defendants in the Derivative Actions, or the courts adjudicating the Derivative Actions or on any additional lawsuits with respect to the matters referred to herein.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
