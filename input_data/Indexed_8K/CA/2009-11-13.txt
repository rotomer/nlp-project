Indemnification of the Underwriters.
          (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in Section 7(a), but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale
Indemnification of the Company.
 
Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of information in the Time of Sale Information and in the Prospectus in the last paragraph of the cover page thereof related to the delivery of the Securities and under the heading "Underwriting" therein set forth in (i) the third paragraph thereof related to the offering of the Securities, (ii) the third and fourth sentences of the fifth paragraph thereof related to market-making activities and (iii) the sixth paragraph thereof related to overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions.
          (c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to Section 7(a) or 7(b), such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under Section 7(a) or 7(b) except to the extent that it has been prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under Section 7(a) or 7(b). If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7(a) or 7(b) that the Indemnifying Party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interest between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by Banc of America Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the

provided, further
 
Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this Section 7(c), the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
Contribution.
          (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d). The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the price at which the Securities underwritten and distributed to the public by such Underwriter

were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
          (f) The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
Non-Exclusive Remedies.

Termination
     10. . (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule I hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Securities that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
Defaulting Underwriter
 
          (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as provided in Section 10(a), the aggregate principal amount of Securities of such series that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities of such series, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities of such series that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Underwriter's share (based on the principal amount of Securities of such series that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder as set forth on Schedule I) of the Securities of such series of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.

     The Securities shall be redeemable, at the Company's option, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice. Upon redemption of the Securities, the Company shall pay a redemption price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the greater of:

     The following terms have the following meanings:

     Notice of any redemption shall be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed. If less than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Securities to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, interest shall cease to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption.
     The Securities are not subject to any sinking fund requirement.
     If a Change of Control Repurchase Event (as defined below) occurs, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all of the Securities as described above, each Holder of the Securities shall have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Securities at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Securities plus accrued and
 
unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant Interest Record Date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date); provided that after giving effect to the purchase, any of the Securities that remain outstanding shall have a denomination of $2,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel for CA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the issuance and sale by the Company of $750,000,000 principal amount of its 5.375% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Notes") pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement dated November  between the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters") and the Company (the "Agreement"). The Notes are being issued under the Indenture dated as of June 1, 2008 between U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and the Company (including the form and terms of the Notes established in the Officers' Certificate of the Company dated the date hereof pursuant to Section 2.2 thereof, the "Indenture").

We have reviewed (a) the Agreement, (b) the Indenture, (c) the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-151619) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company to register the Notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and (d) the Prospectus dated November  as supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement dated November  relating to the offer and sale of the Notes (as so supplemented, the "Prospectus") filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Act. We have also reviewed such other agreements, documents, records, certificates and other materials, and have satisfied ourselves as to such other matters, as we have considered relevant or necessary as a basis for this opinion.

In such review, we have assumed the accuracy and completeness of all agreements, documents, records, certificates and other materials submitted to us, the conformity with the originals of all such materials submitted to us as copies (whether or not certified and including facsimiles), the authenticity of the originals of such materials and all materials submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures and the legal capacity of all natural persons. In delivering this opinion, we have relied, without independent verification, as to factual matters, on certificates and other written or oral statementsof governmental and other public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company, the Underwriters and the Trustee.

This opinion is limited to the law of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, in each case as in effect on the date hereof.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as Exhibit 5.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Commission on the date hereof and the incorporation thereof in the Registration Statement and to the use of our name under the captions "Legal matters" and "Validity of Securities" in the Prospectus.
