The 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of CA, Inc. (the "Company") will be held at 10:00 AM Eastern Time on Tuesday, July 27, 2010 at the Company's headquarters located at One CA Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749 (the "Annual Meeting"). The record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be May 31, 2010.
Because the date of the Annual Meeting will be more than 30 days before the anniversary date of the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company is informing its stockholders, pursuant to Rule 14a-5(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), of the following deadlines for stockholder proposals:
The Company considers March 19, 2010 to be a reasonable time before it begins the printing and mailing of its proxy materials for the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 14a-4(c) under the Exchange Act, the persons named in the proxies solicited on behalf of the Company for use at the Annual Meeting will have the right to exercise discretionary voting authority with respect to proposals submitted after that date.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
