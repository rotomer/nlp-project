The Company's Board of Directors had recommended an annual advisory vote in the Company's 2011 Annual Proxy Statement. Therefore, the Board of Directors has determined that it will include a stockholder advisory vote on compensation of its Named Executive Officers in its proxy materials annually until the next advisory vote on the frequency of the advisory vote on compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers, which will occur no later than the Company's 2017 annual meeting of stockholders.
