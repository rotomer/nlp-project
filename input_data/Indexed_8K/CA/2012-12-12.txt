Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On December 12, 2012, CA, Inc. (the Company) announced that the Company entered into an employment agreement with Michael P. Gregoire (the Employment Agreement) on December 10, 2012, to serve as the Companys Chief Executive Officer. Under the Employment Agreement, Mr. Gregoires employment with the Company will commence on January 7, 2013. Mr. Gregoire will become a member of the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) on the date of his employment with the Company as Chief Executive Officer (or as soon as practicable thereafter), and the Company will continue to nominate him for election while he remains the Companys Chief Executive Officer.
Mr. Gregoire, 46, served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Taleo Corporation (Taleo), a provider of on-demand talent management software solutions, from March 2005 until Taleos acquisition by Oracle Corporation in April 2012. Mr. Gregoire also served as a director of Taleo from April 2005 until April 2012 and served as Chairman of Taleos board of directors from May 2008 until April 2012. Prior to joining Taleo, Mr. Gregoire served as Executive Vice President, Global Services and held various other senior management positions at PeopleSoft, Inc. (PeopleSoft), an enterprise software company, from May 2000 to January 2005. Prior to PeopleSoft, Mr. Gregoire served as Managing Director for global financial markets at Electronic Data Systems Corporation, a global technology services company, from 1996 to April 2000, and in various other roles from 1988 to 1996. Mr. Gregoire has been a director of ShoreTel, Inc., a provider of business communication solutions, since November 2008.
Under the Employment Agreement, Mr. Gregoire will be paid an initial base salary at the annual rate of $1,000,000 (payable in cash).
With respect to each fiscal year beginning with the 2014 fiscal year (starting on April 1, 2013), Mr. Gregoire will be eligible to receive a target annual cash bonus of 150% of his annual base salary and a target long-term incentive performance award of at least $5,500,000, subject to the terms and conditions of the Company's annual performance bonus and long-term incentive performance programs, respectively, and subject to reduction in connection with a proportionate reduction affecting target levels for the Company's other executive officers
. Mr. Gregoire will be eligible to participate in all retirement, welfare and benefit plans and perquisites on a basis that is no less favorable than what is provided to other senior executives of the Company generally.
In connection with his commencement of employment, Mr. Gregoire will be awarded sign-on equity grants under the Companys 2011 Incentive Plan of $3,000,000 in stock options and $2,000,000 in restricted stock units, both of which will vest 34% on January 7, 2014 and 33% on each of January 7, 2015 and January 7, 2016. Mr. Gregoire will also be paid a cash sign-on bonus of $500,000, in lieu of an annual bonus for the Companys 2013 fiscal year and to help offset Mr. Gregoires expenses associated with his relocation to New York and negotiation of the Employment Agreement. The cash sign-on bonus is subject to recoupment if Mr. Gregoires employment is terminated before January 7, 2014 by the Company with cause or by Mr. Gregoire other than for good reason, each as defined in the Employment Agreement.
Mr. Gregoires employment is at-will and may be terminated at any time in accordance with the terms of the Employment Agreement. If Mr. Gregoires employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Gregoire for good reason on or before January 7, 2018, he will be eligible to receive, subject to his execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company: (i) accelerated vesting of any then-unvested portion of his sign-on equity grants (but sign-on stock options may not be exercised and sign-on restricted stock units will not be settled prior to their original vesting dates, and sign-on stock options will expire no later than one year thereafter); (ii) a prorated annual bonus for the year in which the termination date occurs, in an amount determined based on the Companys actual performance and paid at the time his annual bonus would otherwise have been paid; (iii) a cash severance payment equal to 150% of his annual base salary if the termination date occurs on or prior to January 7, 2016, 75% of his annual base salary if the termination date occurs during the period from January 8, 2016 through January 7, 2017, and 37.5% of his annual base salary if the termination date occurs during the period from January 8, 2017 through January 7, 2018; and (iv) payment of COBRA premiums for up to 18 months for himself and his eligible dependents.
If Mr. Gregoires employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Gregoire for good reason after January 7, 2018, he will not be entitled to receive any cash severance, but he will be eligible to receive, subject to his execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company: (i) a full annual bonus for the year in which the termination date occurs, in an amount determined based on the Companys actual performance and paid at the time his annual bonus would
    
otherwise have been paid, provided that the targets and terms of the annual bonus for that year have been approved by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board prior to his termination date; and (ii) COBRA premium payments as described above.
The Company shall also indemnify and hold Mr. Gregoire harmless for acts and omissions in connection with Mr. Gregoires employment to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law and the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and will provide him coverage under the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy. Mr. Gregoire is subject to standard non-compete and non-solicitation covenants during, and for the 18-month period following, his employment with the Company, as well as perpetual confidentiality and mutual non-disparagement covenants. Mr. Gregoires cash and equity incentive awards are subject to the Companys clawback policies and provisions as in place from time to time.
William E. McCracken, the Companys current Chief Executive Officer, has informed the Company of his intention to retire from the Company effective March 31, 2013, and on December 11, 2012 the Company delivered a notice to Mr. McCracken that it has elected not to renew his employment agreement with the Company, dated May 6, 2010.  Mr. McCracken will cease to serve as Chief Executive Officer, and on December 11, 2012 informed the Company of his retirement from the Board, in each case, effective upon Mr. Gregoires commencement of employment with the Company. Mr. McCracken will continue to be employed by the Company as Executive Advisor to the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors until March 31, 2013. Beginning April 1, 2013, he will become a consultant to the Company pursuant to a consulting agreement with the Company (the Consulting Agreement) entered into as of December 11, 2012. The Consulting Agreement will become effective only if Mr. Gregoire commences employment with the Company before January 31, 2013 and if Mr. McCracken executes a separation and release agreement after his termination of employment with the Company on March 31, 2013. Under the terms of the Consulting Agreement, the Company will provide Mr. McCracken a consulting fee of $111,111 per month until December 31, 2013. In the event that the Consulting Agreement is terminated by the Company without cause (as defined therein) or due to Mr. McCracken's death or disability, the Company will pay any remaining consulting fees through the end of the consulting period. Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. McCracken is subject to standard non-compete and non-solicitation covenants for the 24-month period following the termination of his employment. As partial consideration for the Consulting Agreement, the 24-month restricted period will generally commence upon the termination of the Consulting Agreement.
The foregoing descriptions of the Employment Agreement and the Consulting Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such Agreements (including any schedules and exhibits thereto), a copy of which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 hereto and are incorporated by reference herein.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
The declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to the determination of the Companys Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, after considering various factors, including the Companys financial condition, historical and forecast operating results, and available cash flow, as well as any applicable laws and contractual covenants and any other relevant factors. The Companys practice regarding payment of dividends may be modified at any time and from time to time.
    
Repurchases under the Companys stock repurchase program are expected to be made with cash on hand and may be made from time to time, subject to market conditions and other factors, in the open market, through solicited or unsolicited privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The program, which is authorized through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014, does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be modified or suspended at any time at the Companys discretion.
Certain statements in this communication (such as statements containing the words believes, plans, anticipates, expects, estimates, targets and similar expressions) constitute forward-looking statements that are based upon the beliefs of, and assumptions made by, the Companys management, as well as information currently available to management. These forward-looking statements reflect the Companys current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. A number of important factors could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including: the ability to achieve success in the Companys strategy by, among other things, effectively rebalancing the Companys sales force to increase penetration in growth markets and with large enterprises that have not historically been significant customers, enabling the sales force to sell new products, improving the Companys brand in the marketplace and ensuring the Companys set of cloud computing, Software-as-a-Service and other new offerings address the needs of a rapidly changing market, while not adversely affecting the demand for the Companys traditional products or its profitability; global economic factors or political events beyond the Companys control; general economic conditions and credit constraints, or unfavorable economic conditions in a particular region, industry or business sector; the failure to adapt to technological changes and introduce new software products and services in a timely manner; competition in product and service offerings and pricing; the failure to expand partner programs; the ability to retain and attract adequate qualified personnel; the ability to integrate acquired companies and products into existing businesses; the ability to adequately manage and evolve financial reporting and managerial systems and processes; the ability of the Companys products to remain compatible with ever-changing operating environments; breaches of the Companys software products and the Companys and customers' data centers and IT environments; discovery of errors in the Companys software and potential product liability claims; the failure to protect the Companys intellectual property rights and source code; risks associated with sales to government customers; access to software licensed from third parties; risks associated with the use of software from open source code sources; access to third-party code and specifications for the development of code; third-party claims of intellectual property infringement or royalty payments; fluctuations in the number, terms and duration of the Companys license agreements as well as the timing of orders from customers and channel partners; the failure to renew large license transactions on a satisfactory basis; changes in market conditions or the Companys credit ratings; fluctuations in foreign currencies; the failure to effectively execute the Companys workforce reductions; successful outsourcing of various functions to third parties; events or circumstances that would require us to record a goodwill impairment charge; potential tax liabilities; acquisition opportunities that may or may not arise; and other factors described more fully in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as believed, planned, anticipated, expected, estimated, targeted or similarly expressed in a forward-looking manner. The Company assumes no obligation to update the information in this communication, except as otherwise required by law. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.

(1)
    
$500,000 cash payment (subject to applicable tax withholding) to be made to you on the date of the Companys first regularly scheduled payroll after your Start Date;
provided
,
however
, if you provide notice of termination other than for Good Reason, or if the Company terminates you for Cause, in each case where your Termination Date occurs prior to the first anniversary of your Start Date, you will be required to promptly repay the Company the sum of $500,000 (and, if such repayment occurs during calendar year 2013, the form W-2 for calendar year 2013 that you receive from the Company shall not include this $500,000 sign-on bonus payment as income). This cash sign-on award is payable in lieu of a fiscal year 2013 Annual Performance Cash Incentive and is intended to help offset certain expenses associated with your relocation to New York and attorneys fees you incur in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement; and
(2)
    
$5,000,000 in the form of equity incentive compensation, to be granted effective as of your Start Date and which will be issued and maintained under an effective registration statement that has been filed with the SEC, and as determined by the Company based on its valuation methodology as of the Start Date, as follows:
(A)
    
60% (or $3,000,000) in the form of stock options to be granted under the Companys 2011 Incentive Plan (
Sign-on Stock Options
). The Sign-on Stock Options shall vest annually with respect to 34%, 33% and 33% of such grant, on each of the first three anniversaries of the Start Date, subject to your continued service through each such date, and shall otherwise be governed by the terms set forth in this Agreement and the grant agreement attached as
Exhibit B
to this Agreement. The Sign-on Stock Options shall (i) be a Fair Market Value Stock Option (as defined in the Companys 2011 Incentive Plan), (ii) have a ten year maximum exercise term, and (iii) in addition to cash, permit your
discretionary use of net exercise, cashless exercise via a broker and/or surrender of previously owned Company common shares to pay for some or all of the exercise price and tax withholding to the extent permitted by the Companys 2011 Incentive Plan and the grant agreement attached as
Exhibit B
to this Agreement; and
(B)
    
40% (or $2,000,000) in the form of restricted stock units to be granted under the Companys 2011 Incentive Plan (the

). The Sign-on RSUs shall vest and be settled in Company common shares annually with respect to 34%, 33% and 33% of such grant, on each of the first three anniversaries of the Start Date, subject to your continued service through each such date, and shall otherwise be governed by the terms set forth in this Agreement and the grant agreement attached as
Exhibit B
to this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, your Sign-on Stock Options and Sign-on RSUs will be treated in accordance with Section 4.11 of the Companys 2011 Incentive Plan in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in such Plan), which provides that in connection with a Change in Control, if (x) the common shares of the Company (or of any direct or indirect parent entity) will not be publicly traded or (y) your Sign-on Stock Options and Sign-On RSUs will not be honored or assumed, or new rights that substantially preserve the terms of the your Sign-on Stock Options or Sign-on RSUs substituted therefor, any such outstanding Sign-on Stock Options or Sign-on RSUs then held by you which are unexercisable or otherwise unvested or subject to lapse restrictions will automatically be deemed exercisable or otherwise vested or no longer subject to lapse restrictions (and, in the case of Sign-on RSUs, settled), as the case may be, as of the date of such Change in Control.
(a)
    
Vacation
. You will be entitled to paid annual vacation consistent with the Companys vacation policy as in effect from time to time.
(b)
    
Business Expenses
. You will be reimbursed for all business expenses incurred by you in performing your responsibilities under this Agreement. Any such reimbursements under this Section 4(b) shall be subject to the Companys normal practice for senior executives and will be paid to you as soon as practicable but in no event later than 90 days after the Company has received the expense reimbursement request and applicable receipts.
(c)
    
Facilities
. During your employment, you will be provided with office space, facilities, secretarial support and other business services consistent with your position on a basis that is no less favorable than what is provided to other senior executives of the Company generally.
(d)
    
Indemnification
. To the maximum extent permitted by law and the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the Company will indemnify you against any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising by reason of your status as a director, officer, employee and/or agent of the Group during
your employment. In addition, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company will pay or reimburse any expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, you incur in investigating and defending any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding for which you may be entitled to indemnification under this Section 4(d). However, you agree to repay any expenses paid or reimbursed by the Company if it is ultimately determined that you are not legally entitled to be indemnified by the Company. If the Companys ability to make any payment contemplated by this Section 4(d) depends on an investigation or determination by the board of directors of any member of the Group, at your request the Company will use its best efforts to cause the investigation to be made (at the Companys expense) and to have the relevant board reach a determination as soon as reasonably possible. This indemnification will be no less favorable than what is provided to any other senior executive or director (or former senior executive or director) of the Group from time to time. In addition, you will be covered under the Groups directors and officers liability insurance policy(ies) (as in effect from time to time) on terms no less favorable than what is provided to any other senior executive or director (or former senior executive or director) of the Group.

Your continued failure, either due to willful action or as a result of gross neglect, to substantially perform your duties and responsibilities to the Company and its affiliates (the

(B)
    
Your engagement in conduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Group, or that materially harms the reputation or financial position of the Group, unless the conduct in question was undertaken in good faith on an informed basis with due care and with a rational business purpose and based upon the honest belief that such conduct was in the best interest of the Group.
(C)
    
Your conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony or any other crime involving dishonesty, fraud or moral turpitude.

(G)
    
Your withholding, removing, concealing, destroying, altering or by any other means falsifying any material which is requested in connection with an Investigation.
(H)
    
Your disqualification or bar by any governmental or self-regulatory authority from serving in the capacity contemplated by this Agreement or your loss of any governmental or self-regulatory license that is reasonably necessary for you to perform your responsibilities to the Group under this Agreement, if (a) the disqualification, bar or loss continues for more than thirty (30) days and (b) during that period, the Group uses its good faith efforts to cause the disqualification or bar to be lifted or the license replaced. While any disqualification, bar or loss continues during your employment, you will serve in the capacity contemplated by this Agreement to whatever extent legally permissible and, if your employment is not permissible, you will be placed on leave (which will be paid to the extent legally permissible).
(I)
    
Your unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, or related materials, or the violation of any of the material terms of the Employment and Confidentiality Agreement executed by you or any Company standard confidentiality policies and procedures, which may reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Group.
(J)
    
Your violation of the Groups (i) Workplace Violence Policy or (ii) written policies on discrimination, unlawful harassment or substance abuse.
For this definition, no act or omission by you will be willful unless it is made by you in bad faith or without a reasonable belief that your act or omission was in the best interests of the Group. The foregoing is an exclusive list of the acts or omissions that shall be considered Cause for the termination of your employment by the Company, except as provided in Section 13(d).

During the 30 day period after you have received such notice, you shall have an opportunity to cure or remedy such alleged Cause events and to present your case to the full Board (with the assistance of your own counsel) before any termination for Cause is finalized by a vote of a majority of the entire Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose. You shall continue to receive the compensation and benefits provided by this Agreement during the thirty (30) day cure/remedy period.
(c)
    
Termination by you for Good Reason.
Good Reason
 means any of the following:
(A)
    
Any material and adverse change in your title;
(B)
    
Any material and adverse reduction in your authorities or responsibilities, or your not being a direct report to the Board (for avoidance of doubt, it shall be deemed to be a material and adverse reduction in your authorities or responsibilities if you are at any time not the sole Chief Executive Officer of the ultimate parent entity of the Group);

(D)
    
The Companys material breach of this Agreement or any purported termination by the Company of your employment that is in breach of this Agreement.
provided
that (i) no alleged action, reduction or breach set forth in Sections 5(c)(A)  (D) above shall be deemed to constitute Good Reason unless such action, reduction or breach remains uncured, as the case may be, after the expiration of thirty (30) days following delivery to the Company from you of a written notice, setting forth such course of conduct deemed by you to constitute Good Reason; (ii) such written notice must be delivered to the Company within ninety (90) days after you obtain knowledge of such breach constituting Good Reason; and (iii) you must terminate employment within two years after you obtain knowledge of such breach constituting Good Reason. The foregoing Good Reason provisions are intended to qualify under the good reason safe harbor provided by the Section 409A (as defined below) regulations and shall be interpreted in accordance with such intention. The Companys placing you on paid leave (with full compensation and benefits and continued vesting for the portion of such period that occurs prior to your Termination Date) for up to ninety (90) consecutive days while it is determining whether there is a basis to terminate your employment for Cause will not constitute Good Reason.
(d)
    
Termination on Disability or Death
.
(1)
    
The term 
Disability
 means your absence from your responsibilities with the Company on a full-time basis for 180 business days in any consecutive 12 months as a result of incapacity due to mental or physical illness or injury. If a doctor mutually acceptable to you and the Company determines in good faith that your Disability has occurred, the Company may give you a Termination Notice. If within thirty (30) days of the Termination Notice you do not return to full-time performance of your responsibilities, your employment will be terminated due to Disability. If you do return to full-time performance in that 30-day period, the Termination Notice will be cancelled for all purposes of this Agreement. Except as provided in this Section 5(d), your incapacity due to mental or physical illness or injury will not affect the Companys obligations under this Agreement.
(2)
    
Your employment will terminate automatically on your death. If you die before your employment starts, all the provisions of this Agreement will also terminate and there will be no liability of any kind under this Agreement.
(e)
    
Advance Notice Generally Required
. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company and you each acknowledge and agree that your employment with the Company may be terminated by either the Company upon 30 days written
notice to you (subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Agreement) or by you upon 90 days written notice to the Company (subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Agreement), at any time and for any reason, with or without Cause or Good Reason. In addition, this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon your death. The Company may determine to waive all or part of your 90-day notice period at its discretion (but shall provide you with full compensation and benefits for the portion of such period that occurs prior to your Termination Date,
provided
that your Salary shall continue for no less than 30 days during such period). Upon termination of your employment for any reason whatsoever, the Company shall have no further obligations to you after your Termination Date other than those set forth in Sections 4(b), 4(d), 4(e), 4(f) (solely with respect to expenses that are reimbursable under the applicable relocation policy, to the extent that such expenses were incurred but not reimbursed as of the Termination Date in accordance with such policy), 6, 9, 11(a), 14(d), 14(e) and 14(k) of this Agreement, and any continuing obligations owed to you under any other Group agreements with you, which shall all continue to survive beyond your Termination Date. The effective date of your termination of employment shall be referred to herein as the

You agree to execute such documents and take such other actions as the Company may request to reflect such resignations.
(a)
    
General Effect
. On termination in accordance with Section 5, your employment will end and the Group will have no further obligations to you except as provided in Section 5(e)
(b)

Accrued Benefits

provided
that you shall not be entitled to receive any other payments or benefits in the nature of severance or termination pay, except as otherwise provided herein (or in the CIC Severance Policy).
(2)
    
Any unvested Sign-on Stock Options shall immediately vest as of the Termination Date, but will not be exercisable prior to their original vesting date set forth above,
provided
however
that such exercisability shall be accelerated and be permitted to occur as of immediately before the closing of any Change in Control (as defined under the 2011 Incentive Plan) that precedes the original schedule exercise dates.

Any Sign-on RSUs that have not vested and been paid as of your Termination Date shall vest and be settled in accordance with their original schedule set forth above, subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (
Section 409A
),
provided
however
that the settlement shall be accelerated and occur as of immediately before the closing of any Change in Control (as defined under the 2011 Incentive Plan) that precedes the original schedule settlement dates.
(4)
    
You will be eligible to receive an Annual Performance Cash Incentive for the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs, payable at the time awards are normally paid and based upon actual performance of the Company;
provided
that your Termination Date occurs after the Compensation Committee has approved the targets and terms of the Annual Performance Cash Incentive for such fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs;
provided
,
further
, that if the Termination Date occurs on or prior to the fifth anniversary of the Start Date, such amount will be prorated based upon the number of days elapsed in such fiscal year prior to the Termination Date, and if the Termination Date occurs after the fifth anniversary of the Start Date, you will be entitled to the full amount of such bonus.
(5)
    
Subject to your timely election of continuation coverage under the Consolidated Budget Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (
COBRA
) and your continued eligibility for COBRA continuation coverage, the Company shall pay the monthly COBRA premiums for you and your eligible dependents for a period of eighteen (18) months. In accordance with applicable tax laws, the Companys payment of your COBRA premiums may be a taxable benefit to you and in such case you will be responsible for the payment of any taxes on the resulting income.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that you become eligible to receive substantially similar or improved medical, dental or vision benefits from a subsequent employer (whether or not you accept such benefits), the Companys obligations under this Section 6(b)(5) shall immediately cease. You will notify the Company of your eligibility for such benefits from a subsequent employer within thirty (30) days of such eligibility.

(C)
    
37.5% of your Salary if your Termination Date occurs after the fourth anniversary but on or prior to the fifth anniversary of your Start Date;
provided
that, in each case, Salary shall mean your Salary as in effect on the Termination Date (but disregarding any reduction in Salary that constituted Good Reason) (for the avoidance of doubt, if your Termination Date occurs after the fifth anniversary of the Start Date, then you will not be eligible for any cash payments under this Section 6(b)(6)).
(7)
    
All other outstanding awards will be governed by the terms of the applicable plans and award agreements.
(c)

If there is a Change in Control, as defined in the CIC Severance Policy, and you are entitled to the payments and benefits provided in the CIC Severance Policy, such payments and benefits will reduce (but not below zero) the corresponding payments or benefits provided under this Agreement. It is the intent of this provision to pay or to provide to you the greater of the two payments or benefits but not to duplicate them.
(f)
    
Condition
. The Company will not be required to make the payments and provide the benefits stated in this Section 6 (other than your Accrued Benefits), unless within fifty-five (55) days following the Termination Date you execute and deliver to the Company, and do not revoke, a release of claims substantially in the form attached as

However
, Proprietary Information does not include information (1) that was or becomes generally available to the public, other than as a result of a disclosure by you, directly or indirectly, or as a result of the violation by a third party of the Groups confidentiality rights, or (2) that you can establish was independently developed by you without reference to any Proprietary Information.
(b)
    
Use and Disclosure
. You will obtain or create Proprietary Information in the course of your involvement in the Groups activities and may already have Proprietary Information. You agree that the Proprietary Information is the exclusive property of the Group, and that, during your employment, you will use and disclose Proprietary Information only for the Groups benefit and in accordance with any restrictions placed on its use or disclosure by the Group. After your employment, you will not use or disclose any Proprietary Information. In addition, nothing in this Agreement will operate to weaken or waive any rights that the Group may have under statutory or common law, or any other agreement, to the protection of trade secrets, confidential business information and other confidential information.
(c)
    
Limitations
. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits you from providing truthful testimony or information concerning the Group to governmental, regulatory or self-regulatory
authorities. Also, the parties (and their respective employees, representatives and agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without any limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions and other tax analysis) that are provided to either party related to such tax treatment and structure.
(a)
    
General Effect

Restricted Period

On the other hand, in view of your access to Proprietary Information and your importance to the Group, if you compete with the Group for some time after your employment, the Group will likely suffer significant harm. In return for the benefits you will receive from the Group and to induce the Group to enter into this Agreement, and in light of the potential harm you could cause the Group, you agree to the provisions of this Section 8.

complying with this Section 8 will not result in severe economic hardship for you or your family.
(c)
    
Your Payment Obligations
. If you fail to comply with Sections 7 or 8 during the Employment Period and the Restricted Period, you will forfeit all remaining payments owed to you under Section 6 which were conditioned on you providing the Company with the Release.

Notice to New Employers
. Before you accept employment with any other person or entity while any of Section 8(d), (e) or (f) is in effect, you will provide the prospective employer with written notice of the provisions of this Section 8 and will deliver a copy of the notice to the Group.
You agree that you will not make any public statement that would libel, slander or disparage (the foregoing, to 
Disparage
) any member of the Group or any of their respective past or present officers, directors, employees or agents, and the Company agrees that the members of the Board and the Companys executive officers will not Disparage you;
provided
that nothing in this Section 9 or in any other provision of this Agreement shall prevent either you, the Company or the Companys executive officers or Board members, respectively, from providing truthful and candid assessments of Group personnel and processes in accordance with established procedures or truthful testimony or other information in any legal proceeding, Investigation or as otherwise may be required by law. This Section 9 is subject to Section 7(c).

(c)
    
Assumption by any Surviving Company
. Before the effectiveness of any merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange or similar transaction (including an exchange offer combined with a merger or consolidation) involving the Company (a 
Reorganization
) or any sale, lease or other disposition (including by way of a series of transactions or by way of merger, consolidation, stock sale or similar transaction involving one or more subsidiaries) of all or substantially all of the Companys consolidated assets (a 
Sale
), the Company will cause (1) the Surviving Company to unconditionally assume this Agreement in writing and (2) a copy of the assumption to be provided to you. After the Reorganization or Sale, the Surviving Company will be treated for all purposes as the Company under this Agreement. The

provided
that the arbitrator shall be a partner or former partner at a nationally recognized law firm).
(c)
    
Limitation on Damages
. You and the Group agree that there will be no punitive damages payable as a result of any Employment Matter and agree not to request punitive damages.
(d)
    
Injunctions and Enforcement of Arbitration Awards
. You or the Group may bring an action or special proceeding in a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the County of New York to enforce any arbitration award under Section 12(b). Also, the Group may bring such an action or proceeding, in addition to its rights under Section 12(b) and whether or not an arbitration proceeding has been or is ever initiated, to temporarily, preliminarily or
permanently enforce any part of Sections 7 and 8. You agree that (1) your violating any part of Sections 7 and 8 would cause damage to the Group that cannot be measured or repaired, (2) the Group therefore is entitled to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief restraining any actual or threatened violation of those Sections, (3) no bond will need to be posted for the Group to receive such an injunction, order or other relief, (4) no proof will be required that monetary damages for violations of those Sections would be difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate and (5) the General Counsel of the Company is irrevocably appointed as your agent for service of process in connection with any such action or proceeding (the General Counsel will promptly advise you of any such service of process).
(e)
    
Jurisdiction and Choice of Forum

Section 409A
. The parties agree that this Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A or an exemption from Section 409A. In the event that after execution of this Agreement either party makes a determination inconsistent with the preceding sentence, it shall promptly notify the other party of the basis for its determination. The parties agree to renegotiate in good faith the terms of this Agreement at no additional cost to the Company (other than the Companys routine expenses for outside counsel), if you and the Company determine that this Agreement as structured would have adverse tax consequences to you under applicable law. To extent that you would otherwise be entitled to any payment under this Agreement or any plan or arrangement of the Company or its affiliates, that constitutes deferred compensation subject to Section 409A and that if paid during the six months beginning on the Termination Date would be subject to the Section 409A additional tax because you are a specified employee (within the meaning of Section 409A and as determined by the Company), the payment will be paid to you on the earlier of the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date, a change in ownership or effective control of the Company (within the meaning of Section 409A and to the extent permitted by Section 409A) or your death. Similarly, to the extent that you would otherwise be entitled to any benefit (other than a payment) during the six months beginning on the Termination Date that would be subject to the Section 409A additional tax, the benefit will be delayed and will begin being provided on the earlier of the six-month anniversary of the Termination Date, a change in ownership or effective control of the Company (within the meaning of Section 409A and to the extent permitted by Section 409A) or your death. In addition, any payment or benefit due upon a termination of employment that represents a deferral of compensation within the meaning of Section 409A shall be paid or provided to you only upon a separation from service as defined in Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(h). To the extent applicable, each severance payment made under this Agreement shall be deemed to be separate payments, amounts payable under Section 6 of this Agreement shall be deemed not to be
a deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A to the extent provided in the exceptions in Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4) (short-term deferrals) and (b)(9) (separation pay plans, including the exception under subparagraph (iii)) and other applicable provisions of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1 through 1.409A-6.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or elsewhere, any payment or benefit under this Agreement or otherwise that is exempt from Section 409A pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(A) or (C) shall be paid or provided to you only to the extent that the expenses are not incurred, or the benefits are not provided, beyond the last day of the second taxable year following the taxable year in which the separation from service occurs; and provided further, that such expenses shall be reimbursed no later than the last day of the third taxable year following the taxable year in which your separation from service occurs.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to the extent any expense reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit under this Agreement is determined to be subject to Section 409A, the amount of any such expenses eligible for reimbursement, or the provision of any in-kind benefit, in one calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year (except for any lifetime or other aggregate limitation applicable to medical expenses), in no event shall any expenses be reimbursed after the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which you incurred such expenses, and in no event shall any right to reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
(k)
    
Section 280G
. In the event that the payments and other benefits provided for in this Agreement or otherwise payable to you (collectively, Benefits) (i) constitute parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code) and (ii) but for this Section 14(k), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then your Benefits will be either:
(A)
    
delivered in full, or
(B)
    
delivered as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such Benefits being subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code,
whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, results in the receipt by you, on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of Benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such Benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code.
If a reduction in the Benefits constituting parachute payments is necessary so that no portion of such Benefits is subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the reduction shall occur in the manner which has the least economic cost to you and, to the extent the economic cost is equivalent, will be reduced in the reverse order of when a payment would have been made to you, until the required reduction is achieved. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of measuring an equity compensation awards value to you when performing the foregoing comparison between (A) and (B), such awards value shall equal the then aggregate fair market value of the vested shares underlying the award less any aggregate exercise price less applicable
taxes. Also, if two or more equity awards are granted on the same date, each award will be reduced on a pro-rata basis. In all cases, the provisions of this paragraph shall be effected in a manner compliant with Section 409A.
Unless the Company and you otherwise agree in writing, the calculations necessary to effect the foregoing determinations will be performed by the Companys independent auditors or another nationally recognized accounting or consulting firm selected by the Company. However, if the accounting firm so engaged by the Company is also serving as accountant or auditor for the individual or group which will control the Group upon the occurrence of a change in control, the Company shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm other than the accounting firm engaged by the Company for general audit purposes to make the determinations required hereunder. The Company shall bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such accounting firm required to be made hereunder.
The accounting firm engaged to make the determinations hereunder shall provide its calculations, together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation, to the Company and you within thirty (30) calendar days after the date on which such accounting firm has been engaged to make such determinations or such other time as requested by the Company. If the accounting firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable, it shall furnish the Company and you with an opinion reasonably acceptable to you that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to such Benefits. Any good faith determinations of the accounting firm made hereunder shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the Company and you. Notwithstanding the preceding, as expressly permitted by Q/A #32 of the Code Section 280G final regulations, with respect to performing any present value calculations that are required in connection with this Section 14(k), the parties affirmatively elect to utilize the Applicable Federal Rates that are in effect as of the execution of this Agreement (the December 2012 AFRs) and the accounting firm shall therefore use such December 2012 AFRs in its determinations and calculations.
Very truly yours,

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT
Participant Name]    (Participant)
                                                                                                        
Name of Participant                                                
THIS AGREEMENT dated as of the date set forth above and entered into by and between CA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company) and the above-referenced Participant provides for the grant of restricted stock units under the CA, Inc. 2011 Incentive Plan (the Plan). This Agreement incorporates by reference the terms of the Plan, and is subject to the terms of the Plan as well as certain terms of the employment agreement between the Company and Participant dated December __ 2012 (the Employment Agreement). In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement, the Employment Agreement and the terms of the Plan, except as expressly provided herein, the terms of the Plan will control. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, capitalized terms in this Agreement will have the meanings specified in the Plan. A copy of the Plan or related Prospectus may be obtained at no cost by contacting the HR Service Center at 18665144772 or opening an issue via the web at http://caportal.ca.com (via Employee Self-Service  ESS).
The Company hereby grants to the Participant the number of shares of Restricted Stock Units (the Restricted Stock Units) set forth above on the grant date set forth above (the Grant Date).
This Restricted Stock Unit Award will vest with respect to 34% of the underlying shares on the first anniversary of the Grant Date and with respect to an additional 33% of the underlying
shares on each of the second and third anniversaries of the Grant Date of the award. The shares of Common Stock underlying the Restricted Stock Units shall be delivered promptly (but no later than 30 days) following the applicable vesting date, except to the extent set forth in Section 6 of the Employment Agreement. No shares of Common Stock shall be issued to the participant prior to the date on which the Restricted Stock Units vest, and shall be forfeited by the Participant upon the Participants Termination of Employment, as defined in the Plan, prior to vesting for any reason other than as set forth in the Plan or Section 6 of the Employment Agreement.
Where required pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the Company will satisfy any federal or local income tax or social tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units by withholding shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be available for delivery upon the vesting of this award having a Fair Market Value, as defined in the Plan, on the date the shares of Restricted Stock Units first become taxable equal to the minimum statutory withholding obligation or such other withholding obligation as required by applicable law with respect to such taxable shares. In other cases, as a condition to the delivery of Shares or the lapse of restrictions related to this Restricted Stock Unit, or in connection with any other event that gives rise to a tax withholding obligation, the Company (i) may deduct or withhold from any payment or distribution to the Participant (whether or not pursuant to the Plan), (ii) will be entitled to require that the Participant remit cash to the Company (through payroll deduction or otherwise) or (iii) may enter into any other suitable arrangements to withhold, in each case, in an amount sufficient to satisfy such withholding obligation.
The Restricted Stock Unit is subject to the adjustment provisions set forth in Sections 4.11, 5.3 and 5.4 of the Plan.
This award will not obligate the Company or any Related Company to retain the Participant in its employ or service for any period.
This Agreement will be governed by the internal substantive laws, and not the choice of law rules, of the State of New York and construed accordingly, to the extent not superseded by applicable federal law. If any provision of the Agreement is held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, the unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability will not affect any other provision of this Agreement or part thereof, each of which will remain in full force and effect. Any action related to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of the State of New York, County of Suffolk. The Participant will accept service of process as provided under New York law or by registered mail, return receipt requested, and waive any objection based upon
forum non conveniens
or as to personal jurisdiction over the Participant in federal or state courts of the State of New York, County of Suffolk. The choice of forum set forth in this Section 6 shall not be
deemed to preclude the enforcement of any judgment obtained in such forum in any other jurisdiction.
By accepting this Agreement, the Participant:

THIS AGREEMENT dated as of the date set forth above and entered into by and between CA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company) and the above-referenced Optionee provides for the grant of a nonqualified stock option under the CA, Inc. 2011 Incentive Plan (the Plan). This Agreement incorporates by reference the terms of the Plan, and is subject to the terms of the Plan as well as certain terms of the employment agreement between the Company and the Optionee dated December __ 2012 (the Employment Agreement). In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan will control. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, capitalized terms in this Agreement will have the meanings specified in the Plan. A copy of the Plan or related Prospectus may be obtained at no cost by contacting the HR Service Center at 18665144772 or opening an issue via the web at http://caportal.ca.com (via Employee Self-Service  ESS).
The Company hereby grants to the Optionee an option (the Option) to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock set forth above at an exercise price per share set forth above which is equal to the Fair Market Value of such shares on the date the Option is granted (the Grant Date). The Option is not an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.
The Option will vest with respect to 34% of the underlying shares of Common Stock on the first anniversary of the Grant Date and with respect to an additional 33% of the underlying shares of Common Stock on each of the second and third anniversaries of the Grant Date. The Option will expire and will not be exercisable after ten years from Grant Date (the Expiration Date). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may extend the term of the Option to reflect certain securities trading blackouts that the Company may impose in order to comply with applicable laws.
To the extent that the Option is exercisable, the Optionee may exercise the Option by delivering to the Company or its agent a properly executed exercise notice on a form approved by the Committee. The Company will not permit the exercise of the Option if the Company determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that issuance of shares underlying the Option could violate any law or regulation.
In the event of the Optionees death, the Option may be exercised by the executor or administrator of a deceased Optionees estate, or by the person or persons to whom the Option has been transferred by the Optionees will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution, provided that the Company will be under no obligation to deliver shares underlying the Option unless and until the Company is satisfied that the person exercising the Option is the duly appointed executor or administrator of the deceased Optionee or the person to whom the Option has been transferred by the Optionees will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution.
Payment of the exercise price of the Option may be made in cash or by certified check, bank draft, wire transfer or postal or express money order or any other form of consideration approved by the Committee. Alternatively, payment of the exercise price may be made by (a) delivering to the Company, or its agent, a properly executed exercise notice, together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Company the amount of sale proceeds with respect to the portion of the shares to be acquired upon exercise having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the sum of the applicable portion of the exercise price being so paid and appropriate tax withholding, (b) tendering (actually or by attestation) to the Company previously acquired Shares that have been held by the Optionee for at least six months having a Fair Market Value on the date prior to the date of exercise equal to the applicable portion of the Exercise Price being paid, or (c) any combination of the foregoing. Payment of the exercise price of the Option must be made in full for all shares for which the Option is exercised at the time of such exercise, and no shares will be delivered until such payment is made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a form of payment will not be available
if the Company determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that such form of payment could violate any law or regulation.
The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares underlying the Option unless and until the Company is satisfied that (a) proper arrangements have been made with the Company for the payment of any applicable tax withholding obligations, (b) all requirements of all applicable laws have been met, (c) in the event the outstanding Common Stock is at the time listed upon any stock exchange, the shares to be delivered have been listed, or authorized to be listed, upon official notice of issuance upon the exchanges where it is listed, and (d) all legal matters in connection with the issuance and delivery of the shares have been approved by counsel of the Company. The Optionee will have no rights of a stockholder until the shares are actually delivered to the Optionee. Common Stock to be delivered upon the exercise of the Option may constitute an original issue of authorized stock or may consist of treasury stock.
Except as provided below, the Option may not be transferred by the Optionee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution and during the Optionees lifetime the Option may be exercised only by the Optionee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Option may be transferred by the Optionee to his or her family members or to one or more trusts for the benefit of such family members or to one or more limited partnerships in which such family members are the only partners; provided that (a) the Optionee does not receive any consideration for such transfer, (b) written notice of any proposed transfer and the details thereof will have been furnished to the Committee at least three days in advance of such transfer, and (c) the Committee consents to the transfer in writing. If the Option is transferred pursuant to this provision, it will continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions that were applicable to such Option immediately prior to transfer and the Option may be exercised by the transferee only to the same extent that the option could have been exercised by the Optionee had no transfer been made. For this purpose, the Optionees family members will include the Optionees spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents (whether natural, step, adopted or in-laws) siblings, nieces, nephews and grandnieces and grandnephews.
If the Optionee dies or incurs a Termination of Employment due to Disability while employed by or providing services to the Company, any portion of the Option that has not become exercisable as of the date of the Optionees death or Termination of Employment due to Disability will become exercisable in full and will remain exercisable (a) in the case of the Optionees death, by the estate of the deceased Optionee or the person given authority to exercise the Option by the Optionees will or by operation of law for a period of one year following the Optionees death, but not later than the expiration date of the Option; and (b) in the case of the Optionees Termination of Employment or Disability, by the Optionee for a period of one year following the
Optionees Termination of Employment due to Disability, but not later than the Expiration Date.
The Option is subject to the adjustment provisions set forth in Sections 4.11, 5.3 and 5.4 of the Plan.
10.
Tax Withholding

Any action related to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of the State of New York, County of Suffolk.

Exhibit 10.2
CONSULTING AGREEMENT
This Consulting Agreement (Agreement) is entered into this 11th day of December, 2012, by and between CA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), and William E. McCracken.
RECITALS
Mr. McCracken currently is employed as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and is a member of the Board of Directors of the Company.
Effective as of the commencement of employment of the Companys new Chief Executive Officer , anticipated to be January 7, 2013 (the Effective Date), Mr. McCracken will no longer serve as Chief Executive Officer or as a member of the Board of Directors, but is expected to remain employed by the Company in a non-executive capacity through March 31, 2013 (or, if earlier, the day that Mr. McCrackens employment with the Company terminates, the Termination Date) pursuant to the terms of his Employment Agreement with the Company, dated May 6, 2010 (the Employment Agreement). On or around the Termination Date, the Company and Mr. McCracken will enter into a Separation and Release Agreement pursuant to the terms of his Employment Agreement (the Separation Agreement).
The Company, in recognition of Mr. McCrackens ability to provide critical advice to the Board and its new Chief Executive Officer, desires to retain Mr. McCracken to render certain consulting services to the Company for a certain period after his Termination Date on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and Mr. McCracken desires to be retained by the Company on such terms and conditions.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and mutual covenants set forth below, the Company and Mr. McCracken agree as follows:
1.
Duties and Engagement
. During the period commencing on April 1, 2013 and ending on December 31, 2013, unless earlier terminated as provided in Section 9 of this Agreement (the Term), Mr. McCracken agrees to render consulting services to the Company on such matters as the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company may request within Mr. McCrackens knowledge and experience related to the businesses of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Services). The Services shall include, without limitation, assisting the new Chief Executive Officer with his transition, serving as a strategic advisor to the Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors, advising on the Companys strategic planning process, assisting with preparation for Board meetings, and advising and assisting on such other matters as may be requested by the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer and agreed to by Mr. McCracken, which agreement may not be unreasonably withheld. Unless mutually agreed in writing by the parties to this Agreement, Mr. McCracken shall provide Services for no more than 40 hours per month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mr. McCrackens level of services shall not exceed twenty (20) percent of the average level of services that Mr. McCracken performed over the thirty-six (36) month period immediately preceding the Effective
Date, consistent with the parties intent that the Effective Date shall constitute a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
2.
Renewal and Effectiveness of Agreement
. Should the Effective Date not occur prior to January 31, 2013, this Agreement shall never become effective. Further, if Mr. McCracken does not execute and return the Separation Agreement (without revocation) in connection with the termination of his employment with the Company within the timeframe specified therein, this Agreement shall automatically be terminated without any compensation owed to Mr. McCracken.
If the Company wishes to renew this Agreement, it shall inform Mr. McCracken in writing at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the Term. By mutual written agreement, this Agreement or any extension thereof may be renewed for additional terms and under such conditions as the parties may agree.
3.
Compensation
. As compensation for Mr. McCrackens performance of the Services and the obligations stated in Section 1, the Company, having obtained the appropriate approvals from the Compensation Committee of the Board, agrees to pay Mr. McCracken $111,111 per month (Consulting Fees) during the Term. Mr. McCracken shall receive no other fees or compensation in connection with his performance of the Services. The Consulting Fees will be paid on the last day of each month during which Services are performed during the Term.
4.
Location, Personal Benefits and Expenses
.
a. The Services shall be rendered at a location or locations mutually agreeable to the parties;
provided, that
, Mr. McCracken will not be provided dedicated office space and secretarial support during the Term and Mr. McCracken acknowledges that, after the Effective Date and during the Term, he will no longer be eligible to participate in the personal benefits provided to him in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer (including, without limitation, use of corporate aircraft and dedicated car and driver).
 
b. The Company shall reimburse Mr. McCracken for all reasonable out-of-pocket business expenses incurred by him in connection with the performance of the Services following his delivery of documentation of such expenses in the manner required under the Companys applicable travel and expense policies as in effect from time to time.
5.
Independent Contractor Status
. During the Term and any renewal period, Mr. McCracken shall be an independent contractor, and not an employee or agent of the Company or any of its affiliates. Mr. McCracken shall not have authority to assume, create or incur any liabilities or obligations of any kind against or on behalf of the Company. Further, Mr. McCracken shall not be entitled to any compensation or to participate as an employee in any employee benefit programs of the Company, except those incentive and other payments provided in connection with his separation from the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, Mr. McCrackens service under this Agreement will not count towards any vesting of equity awards granted to Mr. McCracken while serving as an employee of the Company.
6.
Taxes
. Mr. McCracken acknowledges and agrees that, as an independent contractor, he shall bear sole responsibility for rendering his services, including payments of all taxes and other governmental payments required for anyone to operate a business or consultancy, including without limitation, the payment of all federal, state and local income taxes, self-employment FICA (social security) taxes, and unemployment and workers compensation payments.

b. The twenty-four (24) month post-employment restriction period referenced in Section 8 of the Employment Agreement shall commence upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement;
provided, that

Any payments that qualify for the short-term deferral exception, the separation pay exception or another exception under Section 409A shall be paid under the applicable exception.  For purposes of the limitations on nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A, each payment under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment which is compliant with or excepted from Section 409A including, but not limited to, the exceptions for short-term deferral amounts, the separation pay exception or any other exception or exclusion under Section 409A.  All payments to be made upon a termination of employment or termination of consulting services under this Agreement may only be made upon a separation from service under Section 409A to the extent necessary in order to avoid the imposition of penalty taxes on Mr. McCracken pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.  In no event may Mr. McCracken, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment under this Agreement.
 9.

Exhibit 99.1
CA Technologies Names Michael P. Gregoire Chief Executive Officer
Former Chairman, President and CEO of Taleo Corp. Will Join Company on January 7, 2013
ISLANDIA, N.Y., December 12, 2012 -- The Board of Directors of CA Technologies (NASDAQ: CA) today announced the unanimous election of Michael P. Gregoire, 46, as the companys new chief executive officer, effective January 7, 2013. A 25-year veteran of the software and IT services industries, Gregoire also was elected to the CA Technologies Board of Directors.
He will succeed William E. McCracken, 70, who has served as CA Technologies chief executive officer since January, 2010 and who is retiring effective March 31, 2013. McCracken also will leave CA Technologies Board of Directors effective January 7, 2013.
I am honored to have the opportunity to lead CA Technologies, Gregoire said. I accepted the position because I believe CA Technologies has a compelling value proposition, a strong reputation and a growing relevance for customers, software engineering, and partners. It is clear that CA Technologies is well-positioned to lead the industry as companies find it more critical than ever to manage and secure their IT environments in the cloud and efficiently provide business services that enable them to win in the marketplace.
Most recently, Gregoire was chairman, president and chief executive officer of Taleo Corp., a cloud-based talent management software company. During his seven years leading Taleo, Gregoire successfully managed an IPO in 2005 and grew revenue from $78 million to $324 million. Taleo was acquired early in 2012 by Oracle Corp. for nearly $2 billion.
Before joining Taleo, Gregoire spent four years at PeopleSoft, Inc., a provider of software solutions for human resource management, financial management, supply chain, customer relationship management and enterprise performance management. While there, he was the executive vice president of PeopleSoft Global Services, leading a team of 4,000 professionals with annual revenue of $2 billion.
Gregoire also spent 12 years at EDS Corp., where he held a number of senior positions including executive director of the global Financial Markets Group, chief technologist for Manufacturing and Financial verticals, as well as several architecture and project management positions.
We are very pleased to have hired someone of Mike Gregoires caliber, said Arthur Weinbach, chairman of the Board of Directors, CA Technologies.  He clearly stood out in the field of candidates we considered, bringing to CA Technologies a compelling track record of success, leadership skills, operating expertise and software industry vision.  We expect CA Technologies employees, customers and partners to benefit from his leadership, years of experience in the software industry and customer focus.
Gregoire will relocate to the New York area.
In making the announcement, Weinbach said McCracken will continue to lead the company until Gregoire joins on January 7, 2013. He will assist Gregoire in the transition until his retirement
1
on March 31, 2013. The company also said it has entered into a consulting agreement with McCracken to further help with the transition through December 31, 2013.
The Board of Directors and the employees of CA Technologies appreciate Bill McCrackens leadership over the past three years and his success in building a customer-centric company with a forward-looking strategy, said Weinbach.  Over his tenure, Bill has repeatedly shown his devotion to the company, our customers and employees.  We want to thank him for all he has done for CA.  We are very grateful.
Gary Fernandes, the director who led the Board search committee added: The Board followed a vigorous search process during the past six months. As the search progressed, it became clear to us that Mike Gregoire is exactly the kind of leader CA Technologies needs. Mike has been a winner in everything he has done in his business and personal lives. He is the ultimate competitor and has a fierce desire to succeed in everything he does. The Board looks forward to working with him.
Gregoire holds a Bachelor of Science degree in physics and computing from Wilfred Laurier University and a Master of Business Administration degree from California Coast University. He also serves on the Board of Directors of ShoreTel, Inc. (NASDAQ: SHOR), a telecommunications company.
