Approvals and Consents. 9.4.1. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and applicable legal requirements, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, as promptly as practicable, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to ensure that the conditions set forth in Article 10 are satisfied and to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 9.4.2. ConAgra and Acquisition LP shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations or permits of, or registration or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority or any other Person required in connection with, and waivers of any violations, defaults or breaches that may be caused by, such party's consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 9.4.3. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other of any material communication from the FTC, the DOJ, FIRB or any other Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Acquisition LP and ConAgra will use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all authorizations or waivers required under the HSR Act and FATA to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, making all filings with the Antitrust Division of the DOJ, the FTC and FIRB required in connection therewith (the initial filings to occur no later than five (5) business days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement) and responding as promptly as practicable to all inquiries received from the DOJ, the FTC or FIRB for additional information or documentation. Subject to reimbursement by Holdco at the Closing pursuant to Section 15.3, ConAgra and Acquisition LP shall pay in equal amounts all filing fees associated with the above referenced filings.

Charter Documents. During the six (6) year period following the Closing Date, Holdco shall not, and shall cause the Acquired Companies not to, amend, alter or otherwise modify their respective Charter Documents in any manner that would adversely affect or otherwise prejudice the indemnity rights or limitations on Liability of any Person who may be entitled to indemnification by the Acquired Companies. The Persons to whom this Section 9.5 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 9.5, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 9.5. 9.6. Investigation and Agreement by the Parties; No Other Representations or Warranties. (a) Acquisition LP, on the one hand, and ConAgra, on the other hand, each acknowledge and agree that they have made their own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, have formed an independent judgment concerning, the other party and its Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations, and such party has requested such documents and information from the other party as such party considers material in determining whether to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Acquisition LP, on the one hand, and ConAgra, on the other hand, acknowledge and agree that they have had an opportunity to ask all questions of and receive answers from the other party with respect to any matter such party considers material in determining whether to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In connection with each party's investigation of the other party and its Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations, each party and its representatives have received from the other party or its representatives certain projections and other forecasts for the other party and its Subsidiaries and certain estimates, plans and budget information. Each party acknowledges and agrees that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections, forecasts, estimates, plans and budgets; that such party is familiar with such uncertainties; that such party is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to it or its representatives; and that such party will not (and will cause all of its respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates or any other Person acting on its behalf to not) assert any claim or cause of action against the other party or any of the other party's direct or indirect partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, Affiliates, consultants, counsel, accountants, investment bankers or representatives with respect thereto, or hold any such other Person liable with respect thereto. (b) Each of Acquisition LP and Holdco, on the one hand, and ConAgra, on the other hand, agree that, except for the representations and warranties made by the other party that are expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the other party has not made and shall not be deemed to have made to such party or to any of its representatives or Affiliates any representation or warranty of any kind. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party agrees that neither the other party nor any of its Affiliates makes or has made any representation or warranty to such party or to any of its representatives or Affiliates with respect to: (i) any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to such party or its counsel, accountants, advisors, lenders, representatives or Affiliates; and (ii) any other information, statement or documents heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to such party or its counsel, accountants, advisors, lenders, representatives or Affiliates with respect to the other party or any of its Subsidiaries or the business, operations or affairs of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent and as expressly covered by a representation and warranty made by the other party and contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. 9.7.

Except as to matters subject to ConAgra's indemnification obligations under Articles 6, 12 and 13, after the Closing Holdco shall indemnify and hold the ConAgra Indemnified Parties harmless from and against all Liability relating to the Company Litigation including, without limitation, all costs and expenses of defending the Company Litigation. 9.7.2. Procedure. ConAgra shall give prompt written notice to Holdco of the commencement or assertion of any action, proceeding, demand or claim in respect of any Company Litigation for which ConAgra seeks indemnification under Section 9.7.1. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, Holdco shall have the right to assume control of the defense of, settle or otherwise dispose of such Company Litigation on such terms as it deems appropriate. Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 12.4 to the contrary, Holdco may settle or compromise any such Company Litigation (i) with the written consent of ConAgra, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or (ii) without such consent, so long as such settlement or compromise includes (A) an unconditional release of ConAgra and/or its Affiliates, as the case may be, from all Liability in respect of such Company Litigation, (B) does not subject ConAgra or its Affiliates to any injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, and (C) does not include a statement or omission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of ConAgra or its Affiliates. ConAgra and its Affiliates shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate at their own expense in the defense of any Company Litigation and any such participation shall not in any way diminish or lessen the obligations of Holdco or the Acquired Companies hereunder. ConAgra shall , and shall cause its Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with Holdco, at Holdco's cost and expense, in connection with the defense of any Company Litigation and, in connection therewith, shall furnish on a timely basis all such information, records, documents and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by Holdco, and provide, on a timely basis, access to and availability of its employees for purposes of such litigation, including, without limitation, for purposes of assisting in trial preparation and the conduct of any trial. 9.7.3.

Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 12.4 to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that ConAgra, at its cost and expense, shall retain all claims and causes of action relating to, and shall have the sole right to control (a) the litigation captioned ConAgra, Inc., et al. vs. Gap Su Kim, et al., Case No. 99-04791 currently pending in the United States District Court, Central District of California, including any appeals thereof (the "California Kim Litigation"), and (b) the Korean trademark proceedings between ConAgra and Gap Su Kim, James Kim, and companies under their control, including Monfort Korea Beef, Inc., a Kim created entity, over the ownership and use of the trademark "Monfort" in Korea as described on Exhibit 9.7.3 (the "Korean Kim Litigation"). ConAgra shall be entitled to receive and retain the benefits of any judgment awarded or settlement reached pursuant to the California Kim Litigation and Holdco shall be entitled to receive and retain any judgment awarded or settlement reached pursuant to the Korean Kim Litigation, or to have any trademark rights acquired as a result of the Korean Kim Litigation, or any other related benefits, assigned to Holdco. Holdco shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, reasonably cooperate with ConAgra, at ConAgra's cost and expense, in respect to the California Kim Litigation and Korean Kim Litigation and, in connection therewith shall furnish, on a timely basis, all information, records, documents and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by ConAgra and provide, on a timely basis, access to, and availability of, Company Employees for purposes of such litigation, including, without limitation, for purposes of assisting in trial preparation and the conduct of any trial. ConAgra may settle or compromise the California Kim Litigation (i) with the written consent of Holdco, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, or (ii) without such consent, so long as such settlement or compromise includes (A) an unconditional release of Holdco and all Acquired Companies from all Liability in respect of the California Kim Litigation, (B) does not subject Holdco or any Acquired Company to any injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, and (C) does not include a statement or omission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of Holdco or any Acquired Company. ConAgra may not settle, dismiss or compromise the Korean Kim Litigation without the prior consent of Holdco, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event ConAgra fails to vigorously pursue the claims relating to the Korean Kim Litigation, Holdco shall have the sole and exclusive right to control such litigation. Holdco shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in the California Kim Litigation and the Korean Kim Litigation and any such participation shall not in any way diminish or lessen the obligations of ConAgra hereunder. 9.7.4. Garden City. The parties acknowledge that ConAgra is the owner of certain insurance claims described in Exhibit 9.7.4(a) (the "Garden City Insurance Claims") that relate to and arise out of a fire at the fed cattle processing plant located at Route 1, Farmland Road, Garden City, Kansas. ConAgra shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to pursue collection of proceeds or reach a settlement with respect to the Garden City Insurance Claims and, except as required in this Section 9.7.4, retain the proceeds with respect to such Garden City Insurance Claims. Holdco shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, reasonably cooperate with ConAgra, at ConAgra's expense, in connection with the Garden City Insurance Claims and, in connection therewith, shall furnish on a timely basis all such information, records, documents and testimony, including testimony through affidavits, depositions and court room appearance, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by ConAgra, and provide, on a timely basis, access to and availability of Company Employees for purposes of such action, including, without limitation, for purposes of assisting in any preparation for proceedings and the conduct of any proceedings.

In the event ConAgra makes one or more Garden City Insurance Capital Contributions, the parties agree that ConAgra shall not receive any additional shares of common stock of, or other equity interest in, Holdco in connection therewith.

Unassignable Contracts. If (i) any third-party's (including any Governmental Authority's) consent or approval to the assignment or other transfer to the applicable Acquired Company of a contract to be transferred pursuant to Sections 2.1.6 or 2.1.17 has not been obtained prior to the Closing, then as to the burdens, obligations, rights or benefits under or pursuant to such contracts (collectively, the "Rights") not assignable to the applicable Acquired Company because such consent or approval has not been obtained: (a) ConAgra shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, hold the Rights in trust for the applicable Acquired Company, for the account and benefit of the applicable Acquired Company; (b) After the Closing, Holdco shall, and shall cause the applicable Acquired Company to take, and ConAgra shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take all such reasonable actions and do all such things as shall be reasonably necessary or desirable in order that (i) the value of the Rights shall be preserved and shall inure to the benefit of the applicable Acquired Company and such that all benefits under the Rights may be received by the applicable Acquired Company and (ii) the applicable Acquired Company will perform the burdens and obligations under such Rights; and (c) After the Closing, ConAgra shall continue to use its reasonable efforts to obtain such consent or approval. 9.9.

During such term, each party shall allow the other party and its representatives access to inspect or copy the Records and Retained Records, as appropriate, during normal business hours. In the event a party intends to destroy any Records or Retained Records in its control at the end of such seven-year term, such party shall first notify the other party at which time the other party shall have the right to remove the Records at its own cost. The parties acknowledge that, in the past, ConAgra and the Acquired Companies have routinely disposed of certain Records on a periodic basis and have not retained such Records for seven (7) years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ConAgra, Holdco and the Acquired Companies may continue such routine periodic record destruction so long as, prior to such destruction, the party intending to destroy the records notifies the other party of the nature of such destruction and permits the other party to remove and retain such Records at its expense. 9.10.Material Covenants.

Closing Material Adverse Effect. 9.12.1. In the event either ConAgra or Acquisition LP notifies the other party of an occurrence of a Closing Material Adverse Effect, then Acquisition LP shall have six (6) business days from the receipt of such notice in which to notify ConAgra if Acquisition LP waives its rights under Section 10.2(d) and Section 11.1(f) with respect to such Closing Material Adverse Effect. If Acquisition LP does not elect to make such waiver, then, if after the date of the occurrence of such Closing Material Adverse Effect, ConAgra should receive an unsolicited, bona fide inquiry from an unrelated third party to acquire the Businesses ("Acquisition Proposal") that ConAgra's Board of Directors has in good faith concluded (following the receipt of the advice of its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors) is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Offer (as defined in Section 9.12.2), ConAgra may then take the following actions: (i) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Acquisition Proposal, provided that (A)(1) concurrently with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such party, it gives Acquisition LP written notice of its intention to furnish nonpublic information and (2) it receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such third party on its behalf, the terms of which are at least as restrictive as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such third party, it furnishes such nonpublic information to Acquisition LP (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished); and (ii) engage in negotiations with the third party with respect to the Acquisition Proposal, provided that concurrently with entering into negotiations with such third party, it gives Acquisition LP written notice of its intention to enter into negotiations with such third party. Thereafter ConAgra shall provide Acquisition LP as promptly as practicable oral and written notice setting forth all such information as is reasonably necessary to keep Acquisition LP informed in all material respects of the status of any such Acquisition Proposal. In the event that the Board of Directors of ConAgra determines that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, it shall promptly give Acquisition LP notice of such determination and Acquisition LP shall have two (2) business days from the receipt of such notice in which to waive such Closing Material Adverse Effect as a Closing condition pursuant to Section 10.2(d) and as a termination right pursuant to Section 11.1(f). In the event Acquisition LP does not waive such Closing Material Adverse Effect as a Closing condition and termination right, ConAgra shall have the right at any time within four (4) business days from its notice to Acquisition LP to terminate this Agreement contemporaneously with entering into definitive documents with respect to such Superior Offer and tendering payment to Acquisition LP, in immediately available funds such amount as may be required to reimburse Acquisition LP and its Affiliates and partners for all out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by any of them in connection with their due diligence efforts or the transactions (including, without limitation, the preparation and negotiation of documentation) contemplated in the Transaction Documents or in the Senior Bank Commitment Letter and Bridge Commitment Letter, including, without limitation, (A) fees, costs and expenses of accountants, escrow agents, counsel, financial advisors and other similar advisors, (B) fees paid to any Governmental Authority, and (C) fees, costs and expenses paid or payable to third parties under the Senior Bank Commitment Letter and Bridge Commitment Letter or in connection with the transactions contemplated therein (collectively, the "Termination Fee"). 9.12.2. Certain Definitions. "Superior Offer" shall mean an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made after the occurrence of Closing Material Adverse Effect by an unrelated third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, the Businesses on terms that the Board of Directors of ConAgra has in good faith concluded (following the receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel and its financial adviser), taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the offer and the Person making the offer, to be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to ConAgra's stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 10.

ConAgra shall have the right, but not the obligation, (i) to participate in any meetings between the Holdco Indemnified Parties and Governmental Authorities; (ii) to receive copies of any remediation or corrective action proposals before such proposals are submitted to Governmental Authorities; and (iii) to provide comments to such proposals for consideration by Holdco. ConAgra shall have twenty (20) business days following receipt to provide comments to Holdco concerning any remediation or corrective action proposals, unless Holdco believes that fewer than twenty (20) business days are available for review because of pending or threatened enforcement action, claims by third parties, or applicable governmental or other deadlines, in which case Holdco will notify ConAgra and the parties will make reasonable arrangements to achieve an expedited review. Holdco shall consider all comments by ConAgra before making a final determination concerning proposed work, but Holdco shall have no obligation to adopt any suggestions by ConAgra. Notwithstanding the exclusive control by Holdco over the selection and performance of any remediation method or goal or other corrective action pursuant to this section, ConAgra shall have no obligation under Section 12.1.1(a) to indemnify the Holdco Indemnified Parties for any cost in excess of the lowest available cost reasonably necessary to achieve the minimum legal requirements to resolve or correct the indemnity claim while maintaining but not unreasonably interfering with the historical use of the subject property. Holdco shall provide to ConAgra reasonable access to all information, documentation, employees, consultants and properties relating to any claim under Section 12.1.1(a) 12.6.Direct Claims. In any case in which an Indemnified Party seeks indemnification hereunder which is not subject to Section 12.4 because no third-party action is involved, the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of any Indemnified Costs which such Indemnified Party claims are subject to indemnification under the terms hereof. The failure of the Indemnified Party to exercise promptness in such notification shall not amount to a waiver of such claim unless, and to the extent, the resulting delay prejudices the position of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. 12.7.Limitation on Indemnification. 12.7.1. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the covenants, representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and in all certificates and documents delivered pursuant to or contemplated by this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall continue for the applicable limitations period notwithstanding such Closing or any investigation made by or on behalf of the party entitled to the benefit thereof or any knowledge of such party; provided, however, that (i) The representations and warranties contained in Section 7.9 (Taxes) (other than Sections 7.9.1(vi), 7.9.1(viii) and 7.9.1(ix)(b)), Section 7.16 (Labor) and Section 7.18 (Environmental) shall not survive the Closing; (ii) ConAgra shall not be responsible for any Holdco Indemnified Costs pursuant to Section 12.1.1(e) suffered by a Holdco Indemnified Party arising out of a breach of any representations or warranties of ConAgra contained in Section 7 unless a claim therefore is asserted in writing within the following periods of time: (A) the representations and warranties contained in Section 7.1 (Organization), Section 7.2 (Articles and By-Laws), Section 7.3 (Corporate Authorization), subpart (i) of Section 7.4 (Effect of the Agreement), Section 7.6 (Capitalization), Section 7.9.1(vi), Section 7.9.1(viii) and Section 7.9.1(ix)(b) (Taxes) and Section 7.17.1(iv) (ERISA) shall survive the Closing Date until the tenth day after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation with respect to such representations and warranties (after taking into account all extensions and suspensions thereof); (B) the representations and warranties contained in Section 7.17 (other than Section 7.17.1(iv)) (ERISA) shall survive the Closing Date for five (5) years following the Closing Date; and (C) all other representations and warranties shall survive for twelve (12) months following the Closing Date; (iii)ConAgra shall not be responsible for any Holdco Indemnified Costs pursuant to Sections 12.1.1(a), (b) and (e) or Non-Income Taxes indemnifiable pursuant to Section 13.5.1 suffered by a Holdco Indemnified Party unless the aggregate of all Holdco Indemnified Costs and such Non-Income Taxes suffered by the Holdco Indemnified Parties exceed, on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ($7,500,000); (iv) the aggregate Liability of ConAgra hereunder, pursuant to Sections 12.1.1(a), (b) and (e) for Holdco Indemnified Costs and Section 13.5.1 for indemnifiable Non-Income Taxes suffered by a Holdco Indemnified Party shall in no event exceed One Hundred Fifty Million United States Dollars ($150,000,000); and (v) ConAgra shall not be responsible for any Holdco Indemnified Costs pursuant to Sections 12.1.1(a), (b), (c), (e), (f) and (h) to the extent that such Holdco Indemnified Costs are reflected as a reserve or expense accrual in (i) the Final Processing Closing Balance Sheet (and are taken into account in calculating the Aggregate Consideration) if such Holdco Indemnified Costs are asserted on behalf of any Acquiring Company (other than Cattle Holdco) or any Processing Company or (ii) the Final Cattleco Closing Balance Sheet (and are taken into account in determining the Cattleco Stockholder Net Investment) if such Holdco Indemnified Costs are asserted on behalf of Cattle Holdco or Cattleco. 12.7.2. Offsets - Representation and Warranty Indemnification. The amount of any Holdco Indemnified Costs for which indemnification is provided under Sections 12.1.1(a), (b), (e) and (f) shall be subject to a net offset equal to the sum of (i) the amount of cash proceeds actually received by any Acquiring Company or Acquired Company from the sale or other divestiture, or use, of any of the assets described on Exhibit 12.7.2 (the "Garden City Assets"), after deducting from the amount of such cash proceeds (A) all out-of-pocket costs, expenses and Taxes incurred by any Acquiring Company or Acquired Company as a direct result of the collection and realization of such cash proceeds, and (B) the book value of the Garden City Assets set forth on the Final Processing Closing Balance Sheet and after increasing such offset by all reductions in Taxes actually realized by Holdco or any Acquiring Company or Acquired Company from the sale or other divestiture of the Garden City Assets (collectively, the "Garden City Value"), plus (ii) the amount of any Garden City Insurance Capital Contribution previously made to Holdco or any Acquired Company or Acquiring Company. In the event Holdco, any Acquiring Company or any Acquired Company receives Garden City Value or any Garden City Insurance Capital Contributions subsequent to receipt of any payment from ConAgra for Holdco Indemnified Costs as described above, then Holdco shall pay to ConAgra the amount of Garden City Value and Garden City Insurance Capital Contributions received to the extent of such prior indemnity payment(s) paid by ConAgra. 12.7.3. [Intentionally Omitted] 12.7.4. Survival. ConAgra shall not be responsible for any Holdco Indemnified Costs pursuant to Section 12.1.1(a) or 12.1.1(b) unless a claim with respect thereto is asserted in writing within five (5) years following the Closing Date. 12.7.5. Offsets - Sections 12.1.1(c) and (d) Indemnification. The amount of Holdco Indemnified Costs for which indemnification is provided under Section 12.1.1(c) or Section 12.1.1(d) shall be subject to a net offset equal to (a) the amount of cash proceeds received under the indemnification provided under Section 12.2 after deducting therefrom all out-of-pocket costs, expenses and Taxes incurred by any Acquiring Company or Acquired Company (other than Cattle Holdco and Cattleco) in connection with the collection and realization of such cash proceeds and after increasing such offset for all reductions in Taxes realized from the collection and realization of such cash proceeds and (b) the amount (the "Profit Amount") by which (x) the aggregate cash proceeds received by any Acquiring Company or Acquired Company (other than Cattle Holdco and Cattleco) from the Divestiture of the Feed Lot Business (after deducting therefrom all out-of-pocket costs, expenses and Taxes incurred by any Acquiring Company or Acquired Company in connection with the Divestiture of the Feed Lot Business and the repayment of all obligations outstanding under the Cattleco Loan Agreement, the Cattleco Note and all other indebtedness incurred by the Feed Lot Business and also after increasing such offset for all reductions in Taxes realized from the Divestiture of Feed Lot Business) exceeds (y) Eighteen Million United States Dollars ($18,000,000); provided, however, in the event that the HMC Call Option (as such term is defined in the Stockholders Agreement) has been previously exercised as contemplated in the Stockholders Agreement then, to the extent that all or any portion of the Profit Amount has been taken into account in calculating the Option Purchase Price (as such term is defined in the Stockholders Agreement) payable in connection with such exercise, such portion of the Profit Amount shall not be available for use as an offset under clause (b) above. 12.7.6. Calculation of Indemnity Payments. The amount of any Holdco Indemnified Costs and ConAgra Indemnified Costs for which indemnification is provided under this Article 12 shall be net of any amounts recovered by the applicable Indemnified Party from any contribution or counterclaims or under any insurance policies (in each case, after deducting therefrom all out-of-pocket costs, expenses and Taxes incurred in connection with the collection and realization of such amounts) with respect to such Holdco Indemnified Costs or ConAgra Indemnified Costs, as applicable, and shall be increased to take account of any net Income Tax cost actually incurred by the applicable Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder attributable to fines and penalties incurred by Holdco or its Affiliates that are not deductible for Income Tax purposes (grossed up for Income Taxes imposed on such increase). In computing the amount of any such Tax cost, the applicable Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified amount. The applicable Indemnified Party agrees to use reasonable best efforts to pursue and collect on any recovery available to it and to net any such recovery against any claim for indemnification hereunder or, if an indemnification claim has already been resolved, against the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to such resolution. After it has been determined that there has been a breach of a representation or warranty, the amount of Holdco Indemnified Costs recoverable under Section 12.1.1(e) shall be determined without regard to any materiality qualification contained therein or to whether or not any such breach results or may result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. 12.7.7. Tax Treatment of Indemnification. For all Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat (and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to treat) any indemnity payment under this Agreement (including, without limitation, any payments by any party hereto, or its designee, to another party hereto, or its designee, under Article 13 hereof, whether or not by way of indemnity or otherwise) as an adjustment to the purchase price unless a final and unappealable determination by an appropriate Governmental Authority (which shall include the execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form) provides otherwise; provided that the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) will be obtained by the Indemnified Party who seeks to accept, via a settlement or compromise with any such Governmental Authority, a position that is contrary to treatment of an indemnity payment (or such other payment) as an adjustment to the purchase price. 12.8.General Liability Casualty Policy, Product Liability and Automobile Claim Indemnification. ConAgra agrees to (i) be responsible for and pay, or cause its applicable plans, policies (or similar arrangements) or carriers to be responsible for and pay (subject to the terms of the applicable plan, policy or arrangement) and (ii) from and after the Closing Date, indemnify and hold harmless each of the Holdco Indemnified Parties from and against all Holdco Indemnified Costs which any Holdco Indemnified Party may sustain, or to which any Holdco Indemnified Party may be subjected, relating to or arising directly or indirectly out of the occurrence on or prior to the Closing Date (whether known or unknown as of the Closing Date) of an event that would have been covered under ConAgra's general liability casualty policy, product liability or automobile self-insurance program, including, without limitation, any item that would otherwise be subject to ConAgra's self-insurance program and whether or not such Holdco Indemnified Costs are in excess of any self-insurance amounts. 12.9.Deed of Cross Guarantee Indemnity. 12.9.1. ConAgra Indemnity. ConAgra agrees, from and after the Closing Date, to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Holdco Indemnified Parties from and against all Holdco Indemnified Costs which any Holdco Indemnified Party may sustain, or to which any Holdco Indemnified Party may be subjected, as a result of any Debt (as defined in the Deed of Cross Guarantee) incurred by ConAgra Trade Group Pty. Ltd. 12.9.2. Holdco Indemnity.

Limited. 12.10. Remedies. After the Closing the provisions of this Agreement shall be the exclusive basis for the assertion of claims against, or the imposition of Liability on, any party by another party hereto in respect of any breach of this Agreement. 12.11. No Contribution. After the Closing, except as provided in Section 12.2, no Acquiring Company or Acquired Company shall be liable for any Holdco Indemnified Costs sustained by any Holdco Indemnified Party; accordingly, ConAgra shall not be entitled to seek contribution or any other payments from an Acquiring Company or Acquired Company for any Holdco Indemnified Costs that ConAgra is obligated to pay pursuant to this Agreement. 12.12. Assignment. The rights and obligations of Holdco and the Holdco Indemnified Parties under this Article 12 shall not be assignable in all or in part; provided, however, that to the extent requested by a lender under the Senior Bank Commitment Letter, the parties shall execute and deliver such documents as may be necessary to effect a collateral assignment of the rights arising under this Agreement to the lenders under the Senior Bank Commitment Letter. 12.13. Mitigation. ConAgra, Holdco, the Acquiring Companies and the Acquired Companies will use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the Indemnified Costs. 12.14. Limitation of Damages. ConAgra, Cattleco, and Holdco shall be responsible only for direct damages, and in no event shall ConAgra, Cattleco, or Holdco be liable for punitive or exemplary, indirect, special consequential or similar damages. 12.15. Other Indemnities. The indemnification obligations set forth in Article 6 and Article 13 are in addition to the indemnification obligations set forth in this Article 12 and, unless expressly stated otherwise in Article 6, this Article 12 or Article 13, the indemnification obligations in Article 6 and Article 13 are not subject to the overall limitations, minimum amounts, time limitations, limitations on recourse and other limitations set forth in this Article 12. 12.16. Exclusive Indemnification. The indemnification obligation set forth in Section 12.1.2 shall be the exclusive indemnification obligations of ConAgra in respect of Pre-Closing Cattlemen Litigation and the provisions of Section 12.1.1 shall not be applicable to Pre-Closing Cattlemen Litigation. 13. Tax Matters. 13.1.Transfer Taxes. Holdco shall be responsible for and shall pay all Non-Income Taxes imposed on or in connection with the sale or transfer of securities hereunder, the sale or transfer of assets to the Acquiring Companies or Acquired Companies and any other transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement (other than the transactions described in Section 2.1.5) and shall indemnify and hold harmless the ConAgra Indemnified Parties from such Non-Income Taxes. ConAgra shall be responsible for and shall pay all Non-Income Taxes imposed on or in connection with the transactions described in Section 2.1.5 and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Holdco Indemnified Parties from such Non-Income Taxes. 13.2.Tax Sharing Agreements. Any tax sharing or other allocation agreement with respect to Taxes to which any Acquiring Company or Acquired Company is a party with ConAgra or any other Affiliate thereof is hereby terminated as of the Closing Date and shall have no further effect for any taxable period. This Article 13 and Section 7.9 above shall control all of the parties' respective obligations for Taxes affecting the Acquiring Companies and Acquired Companies and supersede any and all prior agreements, contracts or understandings between ConAgra or its Affiliates and any Acquiring Company or Acquired Company regarding any Acquiring Company or Acquired Company's Taxes. 13.3. Tax Returns. 13.3.1. Tax Returns. After the Closing, Holdco shall cause each of the Acquired Companies to consent to join, for all Tax periods of the Acquired Companies ending on or before the Closing Date for which the Acquired Companies are eligible to do so, in any consolidated or combined federal, state or local Tax returns of ConAgra. ConAgra shall cause to be prepared and timely filed any and all consolidated or combined federal, state or local Tax returns as well as any separate federal, state, local or foreign Tax returns for the Acquired Companies for all Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date and shall be responsible for the timely payment of all Taxes shown due except (i) if such Taxes are a liability of any Processing Company, to the extent accrued as a Liability on the Final Processing Closing Balance Sheet (and taken into account in calculating the Aggregate Consideration) or (ii) if such Taxes are a Liability of Cattleco, to the extent accrued as a Liability on the Final Cattleco Closing Balance Sheet (and taken into account in determining the Cattleco Stockholder Net Investment), as the case may be. Holdco shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely filed any and all Tax returns of (i) the Acquiring Companies for all Tax Periods and (ii) the Acquired Companies for Tax periods beginning after the Closing Date. Holdco shall provide ConAgra informational drafts of the Income Tax Returns for the Acquiring Companies that include the Closing Date or any portion of the Pre-Closing Period at least thirty (30) days before any such return's due date for filing with the appropriate Governmental Authority. The parties agree that for federal (and applicable state) Income Tax purposes the transactions described in Sections 2.2.3 through 2.2.8 of this Agreement will be treated as occurring at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date as provided in Treas. Reg. ss. 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(B) and analogous state law. Holdco agrees that it and its Affiliates shall report, and take all actions consistent with the Tax reporting of, the Acquiring Companies as never having been members of ConAgra's Group for any Tax purposes (or any unitary, combined or consolidated group of ConAgra), provided that ConAgra and its Subsidiaries shall be in compliance with their obligations under Section 9.1.1(n). The parties agree to cooperate with each other and each other's Affiliates in the preparation of Tax returns pertaining to the Acquiring Companies and the Acquired Companies. The parties shall be entitled to utilize the services of the other party's personnel who would have been responsible for preparing such returns as they relate to the Acquiring Companies and the Acquired Companies, without charge to the extent reasonably necessary in preparing said returns on a timely basis. The parties shall also provide each other with full access to applicable and reasonably relevant records to enable the timely preparation and filing of said returns. ConAgra shall pay on a timely basis all Taxes in respect to the Pre-Closing Period shown as due on the returns it is responsible to prepare under this Section 13.3.1 except (i) if such Taxes are a Liability of any Processing Company, to the extent accrued as a Liability on the Final Processing Closing Balance Sheet (and taken into account in calculating the Aggregate Consideration) or (ii) if such Taxes are a Liability of Cattleco, to the extent accrued as a Liability on the Final Cattleco Closing Balance Sheet (and taken into account in determining the Cattleco Stockholder Net Investment), as the case may be. Holdco shall pay or cause to be paid on a timely basis all Taxes shown as due on the returns it is responsible to prepare under this Section 13.3.1. The parties shall make available to each other without charge, copies of the portions of such returns relating to the Acquiring Companies and the Acquired Companies for Taxable years ending before or including the Closing Date. The parties' obligations to pay Taxes under this Section 13.3.1 shall not affect their rights to indemnification for Taxes under other provisions of this Article 13; it is the intention of the parties hereto that in no event shall a party pay more than once under different provisions of this Agreement for the same Tax Liability. 13.3.2. Allocations. ConAgra shall include the income and deductions of the Acquired Companies (including any deferred income triggered into income by Treas. Reg. ss. 1.1502-13 and Treas. Reg. ss. 1.1502-19, or equivalent provisions of state or local law) on ConAgra's consolidated or combined federal, state or local Income Tax returns for the Pre-Closing Period and shall pay any Income Taxes attributable thereto. In any case where any Tax return covers a Tax period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date, the amount of Taxes allocable between ConAgra on one hand, and the Acquired Companies on the other hand, shall be determined by closing the books of the Acquired Companies as of and including the Closing Date. If the allocation of an item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit cannot be specifically allocated based on such closing of the books, such item shall be allocated on a daily basis. 13.3.3. Straddle Period Returns of the Acquired Companies. For purposes of this Section 13.3.3, "Straddle Period Return" means a Tax return of the Acquiring Companies or Acquired Companies that covers a Taxable year or period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date of a Straddle Period Return, Holdco shall prepare and deliver a copy of such Straddle Period Return return to ConAgra together with (i) in the case of an Income Tax return, a statement of the amount of Income Taxes shown due on such Straddle Period Return that are attributable to Income Taxes accrued on or before the Closing Date by the Acquiring Companies (but, in the case of an Acquiring Company, only such Income Taxes that are the direct result of a breach by ConAgra or a Subsidiary thereof of Section 9.1.1(n) and then only to the extent of the increase in Income Taxes caused by such breach over the Income Taxes that would be payable absent such breach) or Acquired Companies (a "Pre-Closing Straddle Period Income Tax") and (ii) in the case of a Non-Income Tax return, a statement of the excess, if any, of (x) the amount of Non-Income Taxes shown due on such Straddle Period Return that are attributable to the Pre-Closing Period (but, in the case of an Acquiring Company, only such Non-Income Taxes that are the direct result of a breach by ConAgra or a Subsidiary thereof of Section 9.1.1(n) and then only to the extent of the increase in Non-Income Taxes caused by such breach over the Taxes that would be payable absent such breach) over (y) the amount set up as a Liability for such Non-Income Taxes on the Final Processing Closing Balance Sheet (and taken into account in calculating the Aggregate Consideration) or the Final Cattleco Closing Balance Sheet (and taken into account in determining the Cattleco Stockholder Net Investment) (the sum of (x) minus (y) (a "Pre-Closing Straddle Period Non-Income Tax")) (or, in the event that the amount described in (y) is greater than the amount described in (x) (such amount, an "Excess Non-Income Tax Accrual"), a statement of such Excess Non-Income Tax Accrual amount). Not later than five (5) days prior to the due date of such Straddle Period Return, (i) ConAgra shall pay or cause to be paid to Holdco the amount attributable to a Processing Company of any Pre-Closing Straddle Period Income Tax and any Pre-Closing Straddle Period Non-Income Tax, and (ii) ConAgra shall pay or cause to be paid to Cattleco the amount attributable to Cattleco of any Pre-Closing Straddle Period Income Tax and any Pre-Closing Straddle Period Non-Income Tax.

Any payment obligations under this Section 13.3.3 shall not be subject to the limitations of Section 12.7.1(iii) or Section 12.7.1(iv). 13.4.Section 338(g) Election. Holdco shall not make nor allow any of its Affiliates to make an election under Code Section 338(g) with respect to the acquisition of Australia Operating Company without the prior written consent of ConAgra. 13.5. Tax Indemnity. 13.5.1. Tax Indemnity. Subject to Section 13.11 and except to the extent of (x) a Non-Income Tax attributable to a Processing Company that is a Non-Income Tax accrued as a Liability on the Final Processing Closing Balance Sheet (and taken into account in calculating the Aggregate Consideration) or (y) a Non-Income Tax attributable to Cattleco that is a Non-Income Tax accrued as a Liability on the Final Cattleco Closing Balance Sheet (and taken into account in determining the Cattleco Stockholder Net Investment), from and after the Closing Date, ConAgra shall be solely liable for, shall pay and shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Holdco Indemnified Parties from any and all Taxes (including, without limitation, any obligation to contribute to the payment of any Taxes determined on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with respect to a group of corporations that includes or included any of the Acquiring Companies or Acquired Companies), and any costs, expenses, losses or damages, including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses, directly arising out of the protest, determination, assessment or collection of such Taxes (collectively, "Tax Losses") which result from (i) any Liability for Taxes imposed on any of the Acquiring Companies (but, in the case of an Acquiring Company, only if ConAgra or its Subsidiaries breached Section 9.1.1(n) and then only to the extent of the increase in Taxes caused by such breach over the Taxes that would be payable absent such breach or an Income Tax Liability under clause (iii) in this Section below) or Acquired Companies for any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date, including any Acquired Company ceasing to be a member of the ConAgra Group, (ii) the Liability of ConAgra, any member of the ConAgra Group or any Affiliate of ConAgra (other than an Acquiring Company or Acquired Company) for any Taxes for any taxable period or (iii) the Liability of any of the Acquiring Companies or Acquired Companies pursuant to Treas. Reg.ss.1.1502-6 or any analogous state, local or foreign law or regulation or by reason of its having been a member of any consolidated, combined or unitary group on or prior to the Closing Date. 13.5.2. Certain Definition. "Adjustment" means any change in an item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit, including, but not limited to, changes attributable to any amended Income Tax returns, deficiencies asserted by any Taxing authority, overpayments, claims for refund, audit, examination, proceedings or litigation resulting from any of the foregoing events. 13.5.3. Timing Adjustments: Holdco's Income Tax Decrease. If there is an Adjustment to any item reported on an Income Tax return filed with respect to ConAgra or any of its Affiliates (including any Acquiring Company or Acquired Company) for a Pre-Closing Period that results in an increase in the Income Tax liabilities of ConAgra or any of its Affiliates (including any Acquiring Company or Acquired Company to the extent ConAgra is liable for such Income Tax liabilities under this Agreement) and such Adjustment results in a corresponding Adjustment to items reported on an Income Tax return filed by or with respect to Holdco, any Acquiring Company, any Acquired Company or any Affiliate for a period (or a portion of a period) occurring after the Closing Date, with the result that the Income Tax liabilities of Holdco, any Acquiring Company, any Acquired Company, or such Affiliate with respect to any such period are reduced, then Holdco shall pay to ConAgra an amount equal to such increase in Income Taxes of ConAgra or its Affiliates, such payment being limited to the decrease in the Income Tax liabilities of Holdco and its Affiliates. 13.5.4. Timing Adjustments: Holdco's Income Tax Increase. If there is an Adjustment to any item reported on an Income Tax return filed with respect to ConAgra or any of its Affiliates (including any Acquiring Company or any Acquired Company) for a Pre-Closing Period that results in a decrease in the Income Tax liabilities of ConAgra or any of its Affiliates (including any Acquiring Company or any Acquired Company to the extent ConAgra is liable for such Income Tax liabilities under this Agreement) and such Adjustment results in a corresponding Adjustment to items reported on an Income Tax Return filed by or with respect to Holdco, any Acquiring Company or any Acquired Company or any Affiliate for a period (or portion of a period) occurring after the Closing Date, with the result that the Income Tax liabilities of Holdco, any Acquiring Company or Acquired Company, or any such Affiliate with respect to such period are increased, then ConAgra shall pay to Holdco an amount equal to such increase in Income Taxes of Holdco or Holdco's Affiliate, such payment being limited to the decrease in the Income Tax liabilities of ConAgra and its Affiliates. 13.5.5. Payments. Any payment by a party under Section 13.5.3 or Section 13.5.4 shall be due within thirty (30) days after the realization of the applicable Income Tax decrease. Any such payment shall bear interest computed at the underpayment rate and in the manner provided by Section 6621(a)(2) of the Code for a period commencing on the thirtieth day after the actual realization of the applicable Income Tax decrease, and shall bear such interest until paid by the reimbursing party. 13.6.Refunds. Any Taxes of the Acquiring Companies, the Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries that are paid in respect of a Pre-Closing Period and that are refunded to Holdco or any of its Affiliates shall be paid to ConAgra or its designee, except as otherwise provided in this Section 13.6. The term "refunds," "refunded" or derivatives of such terms generally shall include, but are not limited to, refunds of Taxes, overpayments of Taxes, and reductions in Taxes or estimated Taxes (whether by way of credit, reduction, offset or otherwise). Holdco shall or shall cause its Affiliates to pay to ConAgra or its designee any such refunds within ten (10) days of the receipt thereof and shall pay to ConAgra, or its designee, the amount of any refunds utilized (i) as a deposit for or payment of estimated Taxes of any Acquiring Company, Acquired Company or their Subsidiaries or (ii) to reduce the liability for Taxes of any Acquiring Company, Acquired Company or their Subsidiaries, whether by way of credit, reduction, offset or otherwise for any taxable period (other than a Pre-Closing Period with respect to uncollected Taxes not accrued as a liability on the Final Processing Closing Balance Sheet in the case of refunds attributable to any Processing Company or on the Final Cattleco Closing Balance Sheet in the case of refunds attributable to Cattleco) within ten (10) days of the utilization thereof, except (a) in the case of refunds of Taxes attributable to any Processing Company, to the extent accrued as an asset on the Final Processing Closing Balance Sheet (and taken into account in calculating the Aggregate Consideration), (b) in the case of refunds of Taxes attributable to Cattleco, to the extent accrued as an asset on the Final Cattleco Closing Balance Sheet (and taken into account in determining the Cattleco Stockholder Net Investment) or (c) in the case of refunds of Non-Income Tax not covered by clause (a) or (b), any such refund payable to ConAgra or its designee will be limited to the cumulative amount of indemnity payments of Non-Income Taxes made by ConAgra or its designee hereunder. If any portion of any Non-Income Tax refund is retained by Holdco or any Subsidiary thereof pursuant to clause (c) of the preceding sentence, such portion shall increase the basket amount of Section 12.7.1(iii) on a cumulative basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) any refunds of Taxes utilized or received by Cattle Holdco or Cattleco attributable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be paid by such recipient to ConAgra or its designee within ten (10) days of the utilization or receipt thereof and shall not increase the basket amount of Section 12.7.1(iii), and (y) any payment by Holdco or its Subsidiaries to ConAgra or its designee pursuant to this Section 13.6 shall be reduced to take into account any net Income Tax cost to Holdco or its Subsidiaries on the receipt of such refund. Any such refund payable to ConAgra or its designee shall bear interest at the underpayment rate and in the manner provided by Section 6621(a)(2) of the Code commencing on the tenth day after the utilization or receipt of any such refund by Holdco or any of its Affiliates until paid in full to ConAgra or its designee. 13.7.Cooperation.

CONAGRA FOODS FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONAGRA FOODS ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT FOR SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO PORTFOLIO; FRESH BEEF AND PORK PROCESSING BUSINESS TO VENTURE WITH HICKS, MUSE, TATE & FURST OMAHA, Neb., May 21, 2002 - ConAgra Foods, Inc., (NYSE: CAG), one of America's leading food companies, announced today that it has entered into an agreement to transfer its fresh beef and pork processing business to a new venture led by Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Incorporated ("HMTF"). Under the arrangement, ConAgra Foods will own a minority stake and substantially reduce its equity interest in the fresh beef and pork business to $150 million from over $1 billion currently. The HMTF group, in conjunction with Booth Creek Management Inc. and George Gillett, will own 54% of the venture, leaving ConAgra Foods with 46%. As a result of the transaction, HMTF and George Gillett will be acquiring control of one of the largest fresh beef and pork operations in the U.S., headquartered in Greeley, Colo., and the premier beef processing company in the Pacific Rim, headquartered in Brisbane, Australia. Bruce Rohde, chairman and chief executive officer of ConAgra Foods, commented, "This is an important step in sharpening our strategic focus while ensuring continued access to our principal supplier of top-quality meat and pork products. We are pleased that the significant operational and financial progress made by John Simons and his team at our fresh beef and pork operations has made this transaction possible, and we look forward to maintaining a strong vendor relationship with that team for many years to come." The new joint venture will be operated under the name Swift & Company and headquartered in Greeley, Colo. The operating management will be led by John Simons, the current president and chief operating officer of the enterprise. All operating management will remain in place under this structure. Transaction Details o ConAgra Foods will transfer its fresh beef and pork processing business to the venture in a book value transaction. As of the end of ConAgra Foods' fiscal third quarter, the book value of the fresh beef and pork operation was in excess of $1.4 billion. The transferred operations will include ConAgra Foods fresh beef, pork and lamb businesses, all based in Greeley, Colo., together with ConAgra Foods Australian beef operations, based in Brisbane, Australia. o As a result of the transaction, ConAgra Foods will receive a combination of cash, equity, and debt reflecting the book value of the business, which should approximate $1.4 billion on the closing date. ConAgra Foods will receive approximately $800 million in cash and an equity interest valued at $150 million at closing. The joint venture will owe ConAgra Foods $150 million of subordinated debt, $30 million of secured debt, and approximately $250 million of line of credit amounts assumed by the venture. o ConAgra Foods' equity interest will constitute approximately 46% of the venture's equity. ConAgra Foods will report its portion of the joint venture operations under the equity method of accounting. o The HMTF / Gillett group will appoint 5 directors and ConAgra Foods will appoint 2 directors. o The investor group, led by affiliates of HMTF and George Gillett, will have an equity interest of $175 million, representing 54% of the venture, and the investor group has received commitments for the requisite debt financing. o During a 24-month transition period, ConAgra Foods will provide a secured line of credit of up to $350 million to the cattle-feeding subsidiary of the joint venture for cattle feeding operations. The line of credit will be secured by all cattle feeding assets. As of the close of business today, approximately $250 million of this line would be outstanding. Due to the nature of the financing of the cattle feeding operations, financial results for the separate cattle feeding operations will be consolidated into ConAgra Foods' financial results until ConAgra Foods no longer provides such financing. o The transaction is scheduled to close in August 2002. Fiscal 2003 Earnings Outlook & Financial Impact of the Transaction Following the transaction, the company expects fiscal 2003 EPS in the range of $1.60, reflecting solid growth over EPS for fiscal 2002. Even though the company will have fewer businesses in its portfolio in fiscal 2003 due to this transaction, fiscal 2003 EPS are expected to show solid growth over fiscal 2002 EPS due to the net impact of : 1) A high single-digit rate of earnings growth for the company's remaining operations due to growth and efficiency initiatives underway, 2) The removal of approximately $0.12 - $0.15 of EPS in fiscal 2003 due to the dilutive nature of the meat transaction and the costs associated with the deal, and 3) An estimated $0.15 favorable impact of SFAS 142 on EPS.

Q&A : Meat Company Announcment May 21, 2002 1. What led you to the joint venture? o ConAgra Foods has been pursuing a strategy to shift its focus toward branded, value-added, and signature food products. This transaction presents an excellent opportunity for ConAgra Foods to continue favorably altering its portfolio while also providing the company cash to redeploy. o Having a minority interest in the venture will allow ConAgra Foods to participate in some of the upside earnings potential that the red meat companies have as a result of the positive changes that have occurred in those businesses over the last few years. o We chose the combination of Hicks Muse Tate & Furst, George Gillett, and Booth Creek based on their strong financial and operating experience and their familiarity with the beef and pork industry. While they have expertise in the beef and pork business, they do not presently have an asset base which could impede or delay the Hart Scott Rodino (HSR) process in the U.S. or the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) process in Australia. 2. What will ConAgra Foods do with the cash proceeds? Pay down debt. 3. What transaction multiple does the purchase price represent? Approximately 5 X Last Twelve Months EBITDA. 4. Will the venture supply ConAgra Foods the meat needed as inputs in other ConAgra Foods businesses? Yes. ConAgra Foods will continue to source meat for other value-added operations through the venture's plants. 5. What will be owed to ConAgra Foods, and what is the expected timeline on the venture's repayment of indebtedness to ConAgra Foods? At closing, the venture owes ConAgra Foods approximately: $30 million of debt, bearing interest at the annual rate of 8%, secured by the cattle feeding operations, and $250 million from a revolving line of credit related to the cattle feeding operations. The line of credit limit is $350 million, with principal paid as cattle are sold, and bearing floating rate interest payable monthly. We expect this, as well as the $30 million mentioned above, to be repaid in approximately 18-36 months. $150 million of subordinated debt consisting of a promissory note with interest paid-in-kind, which has 7 1/2 -year repayment terms. Early repayment opportunities arise in the event the investor group sells its equity interest in the venture. 6. Will there be any management headcount reductions in the existing fresh meat businesses as a result of this transaction? No. All management at the existing ConAgra Foods fresh red meat operations are planning to join the new venture. 7. Does the company have plans to make other portfolio changes? Our objective is to concentrate our capital and attention in the branded and value-added areas of the food business. We have a strategic program in place which is affecting our mix as we proceed toward our goals. 8. Did the company sell any of its consumer packaged meat business as a part of this transaction? No. Our consumer packaged meat business remains with ConAgra Foods. 9. What events need to occur between now and the closing of the deal? Completion of audited financial statements for the operations for fiscal 2002. The fiscal year concludes at the end of May 2002. Expiration of the Hart Scott Rodino waiting period. Approval of the Foreign Investment Review Board of Australia. Funding of the joint venture at closing, for which the investor group has received financial commitments. 10. How will ConAgra Foods' portion of the joint venture influence ConAgra Foods' earnings after the transaction? ConAgra Foods' portion of the earnings will be reported under the equity method of accounting, so the venture's financial results will not be consolidated into ConAgra Foods' financial statements. ConAgra Foods' pro-rata portion of the venture's earnings will be reflected in ConAgra Foods' income statement, and ConAgra Foods' balance sheet will reflect an investment account for our equity interest in the venture. The investment account on the balance sheet will change based on the venture's earnings and/or dividend payments. However, given the nature of the financing associated with the cattle feeding operations, ConAgra Foods will be consolidating the cattle feeding results into ConAgra Foods' financial results. This will be the case until such financing is no longer provided by ConAgra Foods, even though ConAgra Foods owns only a 46% minority interest in the cattle feeding operations. 11. Does the venture have an exit strategy? Will it eventually go public? That will depend on the future preferences of the shareholders, but future alternatives include : o Continuation and expansion of the venture o Complete sale to public or private buyers o Partial sale to public or private buyers o IPO 12. Are there any agreements about future equity ownership changes between the parties? During the first 24 months, the investor group may acquire the balance of ConAgra Foods' equity interest in the joint venture for ConAgra Foods initial equity account balance plus ConAgra Foods' share of the venture's earnings. After 24 months, the investor group must pay incrementally higher amounts for ConAgra Foods' interest in the venture. 13. Are there any conditions about sales to other parties? If the investor group sells all or a portion of its interest in the venture to a third party, then the venture group may require ConAgra Foods to sell a proportionate amount of its interest in the venture to the third party. If the investor group sells all or a portion of its interest in the venture to a third party, then ConAgra Foods has the right to sell a proportionate amount of its interest in the venture, as well as a proportionate amount of the $150 million subordinated debt, to the third party. If ConAgra Foods sells all or a portion of its interest in the venture to a third party, then the investor group has the right to sell a proportionate amount of its interest in the venture to the third party. 14.
