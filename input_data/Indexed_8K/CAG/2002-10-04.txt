Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. On September 19, 2002, ConAgra Foods, Inc.

The transaction was completed pursuant to an agreement, dated as of May 20, 2002, by and among ConAgra Foods, Inc., Swift Foods (formerly S & C Holdco, Inc.) and HMTF Rawhide, L.P., as amended by amendment no. 1, dated as of July 3, 2002, and amendment no. 2, dated as of September 3, 2002. On September 19, 2002, in connection with the closing of the transaction, ConAgra Foods received: - $766 million in cash; - a 46% equity interest in Swift Foods valued at $150 million; - a $30 million 8% secured promissory note issued by Monfort Finance Company, Inc., the cattle feeding business of Swift Foods; - $262 million payable by the cattle feeding business of Swift Foods to ConAgra Foods pursuant to a secured line of credit carrying an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.5%; and - $150 million subordinated promissory note payable by S&C Holdco 2, a subsidiary of Swifts Foods, maturing in seven and one-half years, with paid-in-kind interest accruing at 8% for the first five years, 9% in the sixth year and 10% thereafter.

The parties entered into a market-based preferred supplier agreement pursuant to which for an initial term of seven years, Swift & Company will supply fresh beef and pork products at fair market prices based on prior pricing practices between ConAgra Foods and its fresh beef and pork processing businesses. Additionally, pursuant to the revolving credit agreement referenced above, the secured line of credit limit is $350 million, with principal paid to ConAgra Foods as cattle and assets are sold, and bearing floating rate interest payable monthly.

ConAgra Foods, Inc. also purchased $150 million senior subordinated notes from a subsidiary of Swift, as part of the transaction. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are based on the following: 1. The historical consolidated financial statements of ConAgra Foods, Inc. as of and for the year ended May 26, 2002. 2. The elimination of the assets, liabilities and operating results of the businesses sold. 3. The unaudited pro forma statement of earnings adjustments reflecting: a. The company's equity in earnings of $30.5 million for the venture's operations based on its 46% ownership interest. b. A reduction in net interest expense relating to (i) the assumed repayment of short-term borrowing with the cash proceeds received in the transaction at the company's weighted average short-term interest rate of 3.2%, (ii) interest income on the $180 million of 8% promissory notes, (iii) interest income on the $150 million 12.5% senior subordinated note and (iv) net interest income on the domestic cattle feeding credit line as follows: Reduction in interest expense $19.4 Increase in interest income: Promissory notes 14.4 Senior subordinated notes 9.4 Cattle feeding credit line 6.5 ------ $49.7 The company has the ability to sell or dispose of its interest in the $150 senior subordinated notes after a six-month period and, as a result, has only reflected interest income on these notes for that period of time. c.

The unaudited pro forma balance sheet adjustments are as follows: Actual cash received on September 19, 2002 $ 765.7 Purchased senior subordinated notes (150.0) Increase in book value from May 26, 2002 to Sept. 19, 2002 (a) (13.6) ------ Pro forma net cash received as of May 26, 2002 $ 602.1 Other assets: Equity investment 150.0 Promissory notes receivable 150.0 Senior subordinated notes receivable 150.0 Cattle feeding assets sold (b) 316.1 766.1 ------ (50.0) Cattle feeding liabilities sold (b) ------- Net adjustments $1,318.2 (a) Actual cash received is based on estimated adjusted net book value (subject to post-closing adjustments) as of September 19, 2002. Pro forma cash received is based on a closing balance sheet date of May 26, 2002. (b) The company will continue to finance the domestic cattle feeding operations with a secured credit line of up to $350 million and a $30 million promissory note. Accordingly, although the company has legally divested this operation, in accordance with applicable accounting literature the company will continue to include the assets and liabilities of the cattle feeding business within its consolidated balance sheet. The notes receivable to ConAgra Foods, Inc. relating to the cattle feeding financing are therefore reflected as the net assets of the cattle feeding operations. The cattle feeding assets and liabilities included in the adjustments table reflect the net assets of the domestic cattle feeding operations as of the pro forma acquisition date of May 26, 2002. 5. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements exclude non-recurring direct transaction costs expected to be incurred by the company of approximately $.03 - $.04 per share. 6.
