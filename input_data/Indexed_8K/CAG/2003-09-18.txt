FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONAGRA FOODS REPORTS FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS, EXPECTS SOLID EARNINGS PERFORMANCE FOR FISCAL 2004 FIRST Quarter 2004 Highlights (versus a year ago): o EPS = $0.37 vs. $0.43 last year. >> Several items affect year-over-year comparisons: o Prior year includes $0.05 per diluted share of earnings from businesses the company no longer owns and the impact of an accounting change. o Current year includes $0.07 per diluted share of earnings, reflecting the net effect of tax matters, legal settlements, and an accounting change. >> Current quarter results reflect growth in Agricultural Products earnings, improved interest expense, and lower first quarter profits for Packaged Foods and Food Ingredients. >> Earnings from discontinued chicken operations were $0.01 per diluted share lower in the current year than in the prior year. The company expects to complete the divestiture of its chicken business in the second fiscal quarter. OMAHA, Neb., Sept. 18, 2003--Today ConAgra Foods, Inc. (NYSE: CAG), one of America's leading packaged food companies, reported first quarter diluted EPS of $0.37 for the quarter ended Aug. 24, 2003, compared with $0.43 last fiscal year. As expected, the company's first-quarter sales and EPS were below last year, reflecting strategic divestitures completed during fiscal 2003. Sales were $4.4 billion compared with $6.6 billion last year, following the divestiture of the fresh beef, pork, canned seafood, and cheese businesses. Net income was $195 million compared with $228 million last fiscal year.
Bruce Rohde, chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "We've made a significant and deliberate transformation of our portfolio to have a higher-quality mix of businesses. Our first quarter is typically one of the lightest of our fiscal year, and, because of that and divestitures, we planned for this fiscal year's first-quarter sales and earnings to be below last year's. However, with our improved business mix, we expect a solid earnings performance for the full fiscal year. We have focused our resources on profit-enhancing initiatives in the areas of brand building, sales and marketing execution, customer service capabilities, and cost-savings programs. Our businesses have identified and are aggressively pursuing cost-saving opportunities to reduce complexity, improve efficiency, and drive solid earnings performance. The target is improved overall margins, better returns on invested capital, and a solid earnings performance this fiscal year and next." Packaged Foods Packaged Foods segment sales were $2.7 billion, compared with $2.9 billion last year. The year-over-year sales decrease reflects the divestiture of the canned seafood and cheese processing operations. During the quarter, sales grew for many key categories and brands, including frozen meals (Banquet, Healthy Choice, and Kid Cuisine), canned pasta (Chef Boyardee), tomato products (Hunt's), whipped toppings (Reddi-wip), cooking spray (PAM), dinner kits (Banquet Homestyle Bakes), liquid eggs (Egg Beaters), meat snacks (Slim Jim and Pemmican), chili (Wolf), oil (Wesson), sausages (Eckrich and Brown 'N Serve), and others. Some brands that did not post sales gains for the quarter include Armour, Blue Bonnet, Butterball, Marie Callender's, Orville Redenbacher's, and Van Camp's. The company is particularly encouraged by favorable results for some of its large frozen brands. During the quarter, the company invested in new branded retail products in frozen meals, shelf-stable meals, snacks, and dessert categories as part of a plan to fuel profitable future growth. Overall sales for the company's foodservice operations declined slightly for the quarter, primarily in processed and specialty meats, but some key product lines showed sales growth and the industry is showing positive signs in certain segments. Volumes for deli customers grew while volumes for retail and foodservice customers declined. Marketing mix improved during the quarter as part of an ongoing program to target a greater percentage of marketing resources toward consumer connections and usage.
Overall segment operating profit declined to $284 million from $353 million. Operating profit and margins reflect overall volume declines and unfavorable mix. The Packaged Foods segment will continue to focus its resources on brand building, product mix, customer service, and productivity initiatives as part of its ongoing plan to grow Packaged Foods sales and profits and expand margins. Food Ingredients During the quarter, sales for the Food Ingredients segment were $574 million compared with $591 million last year. Sales results reflect higher flour prices which were more than offset by expected lower volumes for some basic ingredients operations. Operating profits declined to $31 million, reflecting higher input costs for the flour business and lower profits for some merchandising operations.
Agricultural Products During the first quarter, operating profits for the Agricultural Products segment increased to $58 million compared with $39 million in the prior year, reflecting improved customer and product mix and effective cost management. Sales were $1.1 billion, down slightly as part of a plan to improve customer mix. The company's Agricultural Products segment consists of results for UAP (United Agri Products), which distributes crop inputs to the grower community. Interest, Corporate Expense, Depreciation & Capital Expenditures From Continuing Operations Net interest expense for the quarter was $66 million compared with $84 million the prior year. Capital expenditures totaled $78 million compared with $91 million last year. Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $91 million for the quarter versus $108 million a year ago. Dividends paid were $131 million compared with $124 million. Corporate expense was $92 million compared with $67 million last year - the increase largely reflects the resolution of litigation described below. Rohde concluded, "We have been progressively reshaping the company toward a richer business mix and building customer-focused resources. Our goal is to become America's Favorite Food Company with a portfolio of favorite products for grocery, restaurant, and ingredient customers, supported by superior customer service capabilities. We continue to make important changes to our portfolio of businesses so that all of our resources are strategically aligned with our goals to profitably and efficiently serve customers. We look forward to reporting on our progress."
Items Affecting Year-Over-Year Comparability of Results Items in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 that are not repeated in first quarter of fiscal 2004: o Prior year results include $0.05 per diluted share of earnings from businesses the company no longer owns and the impact of an accounting change. o The results for the first quarter of the company's last fiscal year included approximately $0.04 per diluted share of earnings due to businesses the company no longer owns-fresh beef and pork (divested September 2002), canned seafood (divested May 2003), and cheese (divested May 2003), and also included $0.01 per diluted share of earnings from a change in accounting relating to the required adoption of SFAS 142, which deals with intangibles. Included in the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2004: o Current year results include net $0.07 per diluted share of earnings, reflecting tax matters, legal settlements, and an accounting change relating to SFAS 143, which deals with asset retirement obligations. o The results for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 included approximately $0.02 per diluted share of expense from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting related to the required adoption of SFAS 143, which deals with asset retirement obligations. o The results for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 include approximately $0.03 per diluted share of litigation expense related to a choline cloride joint venture with DuPont that was sold in 1997. That expense is reported as part of the corporate expense and is not part of the operating segment results. o The results for the first fiscal quarter of 2004 include approximately $0.12 per diluted share of earnings related to tax matters. Recently, the company closed out some interest rate swaps put in place as part of a strategy to hedge interest costs associated with long-term debt. As a result, the company's effective tax rate for the quarter was reduced, as the company on a go-forward basis will utilize capital loss carry-forwards generated from the business disposition process. The quarterly benefit from tax matters also includes amounts related to finalizing IRS audits of the company's federal tax returns. The overall quarterly benefit from tax matters results in an effective tax rate of approximately 9% for the quarter. This is substantially lower than the 38% effective tax rate expected for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Discontinued Operations During the quarter, earnings from discontinued chicken operations were $0.01 per diluted share lower than in the same quarter last year, reflecting market conditions. The company expects to complete the sale of its chicken business to Pilgrim's Pride Corp. in the second fiscal quarter. Reclassification During the quarter, the bulk fertilizer business was moved from the Agricultural Products segment to the Food Ingredients segment because that business fits with and is managed with the company's other basic inputs operations. Historical segment results have been changed to reflect this and are available in the question-and-answer document relating to this release on the company's Web site at www.conagrafoods.com under the section for Investors. ConAgra Foods, Inc., (NYSE: CAG) is one of North America's leading packaged food companies, serving consumer grocery retailers, as well as restaurants and other foodservice establishments. Popular ConAgra Foods consumer brands include: ACT II, Armour, Banquet, Blue Bonnet, Butterball, Chef Boyardee, Cook's, Eckrich, Gulden's, Healthy Choice, Hebrew National, Hunt's, Kid Cuisine, Knott's Berry Farm, La Choy, Louis Kemp, Marie Callender's, Orville Redenbacher's, Parkay, Reddi-wip, Slim Jim, PAM, Pemmican, Peter Pan, Snack Pack, Swiss Miss, Van Camp's, Wesson, and many others.

9. What was Corporate Expense for the quarter? $92 million (vs. $67 million in Q1 2003). 10. What was the main factor driving the increase in Corporate Expense for the quarter?

15. What was the trade working capital position at quarter end? Trade working capital is defined as the net position of Accounts Receivable + Inventory less Current Operating Liabilities (Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, and Advances on Sales). Q1FY04 Q1FY03 Accounts Receivable $1,571 $1,911 Inventory $3,443 $4,473 Less: Accounts Payable $1,616 $1,537 Less: Accrued Expenses $1,740 $1,691 Less: Advances on Sales $ 180 $ 180 Net Position $1,478 $2,976 16. What is the estimate of the effective tax rate for the remaining quarters of fiscal 2004? Approximately 38%. 17. What are projected Capital Expenditures for fiscal 2004? $420 million. 18. What is the expected net interest expense for fiscal 2004? Approximately $260 million. 19. You mentioned that you liquidated interest rate swaps recently. How does that alter your short-term earnings outlook? o We use swaps as part of a strategy to hedge against interest rate risk. o We entered some swaps approximately 2 years ago when, for strategic reasons, we converted some short-term debt to long-term debt. o Recently we liquidated those swaps and, as a result, locked in interest rates on some debt instruments. o The income statement impact of the benefit of the swaps is a reduction of interest expense, and has already been anticipated in our interest expense estimate of $260 million for fiscal 2004. Thus we have no alteration of our short-term earnings outlook as a result of liquidating the swaps. o Accounting for swaps is complex. The benefit of the swaps is recognized over the term of the debt instruments hedged. For this reason, our interest expense in fiscal 2005 through 2008 is expected to continue to reflect the interest rates we have locked in, and will be reflected in our estimates for interest expense as we provide them annually.
20. The company continues to make changes to its portfolio. Why? The company is concentrating its capital in branded and value-added food opportunities. This is part of an ongoing agenda to improve the strength and consistency of earnings by focusing on businesses with higher margin opportunities and lower volatility. Accordingly, the company divested fresh beef and pork, canned seafood, and cheese operations. In addition, the company reached an agreement to sell its chicken business. 21. When does the company expect to complete the sale of its chicken business? In the second quarter of fiscal 2004. 22. Why has there been a change to historical segment classifications? During the quarter, the bulk fertilizer business was moved from the Agricultural Products segment to the Food Ingredients segment because that business fits with and is managed with the company's other basic inputs operations. Therefore, historical results have been changed to reflect this move. Overall current and historical diluted EPS does not change as a result of the classification changes. 23. What are the revisions to historical segment results as a result of the classification change that took place this quarter? Please see the attached tables - One shows segment information, the other shows entire P/L information.
