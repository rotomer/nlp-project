FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONAGRA FOODS REPORTS STRONG SECOND-QUARTER AND FIRST-HALF EPS; STRATEGIC PORTFOLIO CHANGES COMPLETE, SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED SECOND-QUARTER FISCAL 2004 Highlights (versus a year ago): o Diluted EPS = $0.51, vs. $0.44 last year. >> Current quarter earnings of $0.51 per diluted share include a $0.04 charge related to the discontinued operations of UAP (United Agri Products). UAP and chicken processing results are now classified as discontinued operations as a result of recently completed divestitures. >> Current quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations grew 18%. o On Nov. 23, the company sold its last two significant non-core businesses--chicken processing and United Agri Products--thereby completing a multi-year program that strategically reshaped the company to focus capital on branded, value-added foods. o On Dec. 4, the company announced a $1 billion share repurchase program, funded by its strong cash position. Solid Operating Results: o Comparable Packaged Foods sales and operating profit increased over prior year; this excludes amounts in the year-ago period generated by operations which have since been divested. o Food Ingredients operating profit increased, reflecting better performance from several businesses. o During the quarter the company began implementing operational efficiency initiatives that will span the next several quarters. OMAHA, Neb., Dec. 22, 2003 -- Today ConAgra Foods, Inc. (NYSE: CAG), home of many of America's favorite food brands, reported diluted EPS of $0.51 for the second quarter ended Nov. 23, 2003, compared with $0.44 last fiscal year. Current quarter earnings of $0.51 per diluted share include a charge of approximately $0.04 per share related to the discontinued operations of UAP. Diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 18% for the quarter. Sales for the company's fiscal second quarter were $3.9 billion, $578 million less than last year; operating profit was $501 million for the second quarter, $5 million less than last year. The sales and operating profit comparisons reflect the strategic divestiture of non-core businesses during the prior fiscal year. Sales and operating results for current and prior year reflect the reclassification of chicken processing and UAP as discontinued operations. Bruce Rohde, chairman and chief executive officer commented, "Our team's accomplishments this fiscal year have been significant. As planned, we completed the strategic reshaping of the company by divesting our last two significant non-core businesses -- chicken processing and UAP. ConAgra Foods is well positioned for the future, and our focus is on creating shareholder value through improved profit margins and returns on capital with branded and value-added food products as we build America's Favorite Food Company. As part of our plan to re-deploy capital, we recently announced a $1 billion share repurchase program to complete an efficient reallocation of resources." He continued, "Our overall EPS results in the second quarter and first half were solid and on target. Overall operating trends for the second half of 2004 are expected to show strength, driven by a strong fourth-quarter performance, due to operations improvements within our supply chain and administrative functions, and also favorably impacted by marketing initiatives we have underway." Segment Changes Recently the company sold United Agri Products (UAP), its U.S. and Canadian crop inputs business. This resulted in reclassifying the Agricultural Products segment as discontinued operations. Operating Efficiency Initiatives The company has operating efficiency initiatives underway that are intended to improve the company's cost structure, margins, and competitive position. Implementing these initiatives resulted in approximately $0.01 per diluted share charge in the current quarter, and is expected to result in $0.05- $0.10 per diluted share of charges in the second half of 2004. The company will identify those expenses as such in its future earnings releases. Packaged Foods Packaged Foods sales and operating profit for the quarter increased year-over-year, excluding $154 million of sales and $15 million of operating profit from divested businesses in prior year amounts: o Packaged Foods sales were $3.2 billion, 2% below $3.3 billion as reported last fiscal year. Packaged Foods sales increased 3% for the quarter, excluding $154 million of sales from divested businesses in prior year amounts. During the quarter, many major consumer brands posted sales growth including Banquet, Chef Boyardee, Egg Beaters, Hebrew National, Hunt's, Kid Cuisine, Marie Callender's, Orville Redenbacher's, PAM, Reddi-wip, Slim Jim, Snack Pack, Wesson, and others. Overall, the company's top 30 consumer brands, which represent almost two-thirds of the Packaged Foods segment sales, grew 5% as a group. Several major brands posted double-digit sales growth, including Banquet, Chef Boyardee, Egg Beaters, PAM, Reddi-wip, Slim Jim, Snack Pack, and others, partly reflecting new marketing initiatives, new products, and favorable consumer trends. For the overall consumer products portfolio, the new unified sales force and product bundling sales programs also contributed to sales growth for the quarter. In addition, overall foodservice sales increased for the quarter, reflecting a more favorable environment for some components of that business. o Packaged Foods overall operating profit was $443 million, 3% below last year as reported. Packaged Foods segment operating profits increased 2% for the quarter, excluding $15 million of operating profit in the prior year amounts from divested businesses and $7 million of expenses in the current quarter associated with implementing cost-saving initiatives. Packaged Foods operating profit reflects growth for several major brands and product lines, partly offset by lower profits for the branded consumer meat products categories--hot dogs, turkeys, and lunch meats--caused by competitive pressure on margins. For the first half of the year, Packaged Foods sales were $5.9 billion, compared with $6.2 billion last fiscal year, which included $306 million of sales from divested businesses. Segment operating profit was $727 million, compared with $809 million for the first half of last fiscal year; divested businesses contributed approximately $26 million of operating profit to the Packaged Foods segment in the first half of last fiscal year. The company has undertaken specific top-line growth initiatives which include product quality and packaging improvements, new product introductions, marketing mix and marketing efficiency improvements, as well as a unified sales force and product bundling programs. As noted earlier, the company also has significant cost-saving and efficiency initiatives underway which involve procurement, manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, administrative, and other functions. The company plans for those cost-savings initiatives to favorably impact future Packaged Foods operating profit. Food Ingredients During the quarter, sales for the Food Ingredients segment were $645 million, compared with $650 million for the same quarter last year. Operating profit increased to $57 million from $47 million, reflecting better results from the Specialty Ingredients group's dehydrated garlic and onion operations as well as increased volumes and margins in the Basic Ingredients group's merchandising operations. Profits for flour milling operations were essentially flat year-over-year. Segment operating profit includes approximately $4 million of expense in the current quarter associated with implementing cost-saving initiatives. For the first half, sales for the Food Ingredients segment were $1.2 billion, down 2% from last year. Operating profit increased to $88 million from $86 million last fiscal year. Discontinued Operations and Equity Method Investment Earnings The company will now report UAP operating results as discontinued operations due to the divestiture completed on Nov. 23, 2003. Reporting this business as discontinued operations has resulted in reclassifications to certain historical amounts. Those reclassifications are detailed in the question-and-answer document relating to this release on the company's Web site at www.conagrafoods.com under the section for Investors. Earnings from discontinued operations were $0.06 per diluted share in the quarter, unchanged from last year. Current quarter earnings from discontinued operations include charges of approximately $0.04 per diluted share related to the discontinued operations of UAP. First-half earnings from discontinued operations were $0.13 per share compared with $0.12 per share last fiscal year. Equity Method Investment Earnings for the quarter were $16 million, compared with $7 million for the same quarter last year. First-half results were $28 million, compared with $15 million for the same period last fiscal year, partly reflecting the company's interest in a beef joint venture for all of fiscal 2004 but only part of the year in fiscal 2003. Interest, Depreciation & Capital Expenditures from Continuing Operations During the second quarter, capital expenditures from continuing operations for property, plant and equipment were approximately $80 million compared with $85 million for the same quarter last year. Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $88 million for the quarter versus $94 million for the same quarter last year. Dividends paid totaled $131 million. Net interest expense was $68 million compared with $70 million for the same quarter last year. For the first half of the fiscal year, capital expenditures from continuing operations for property, plant and equipment were approximately $158 million compared with $172 million for the first half of last fiscal year. Depreciation and amortization expenses amounted to $174 million compared with $196 million last fiscal year. Dividends paid totaled $262 million. Net interest expense was $134 million compared with $153 million last fiscal year. Portfolio Reshaping Completion & Share Repurchase Program On Nov. 23, the company completed a multi-year portfolio reshaping program to focus on branded, value-added foods. On that day, the company sold its last two significant non-core businesses--chicken processing and UAP--and subsequently received more than $800 million of cash from those transactions. Shortly after the close of those transactions, the company announced a $1 billion share repurchase program as part of its strong capital allocation discipline. The $1 billion share repurchase program begins on or after Dec. 22, 2003, and equates to approximately 40 million shares at recent market prices, which represents close to 7% of the company's existing common stock. Outlook Bruce Rohde continued, "We are confident that our efficiency-enhancing and top-line growth initiatives will result in a solid operating performance in the second half of fiscal 2004, driven by a strong fourth- quarter performance. I look forward to reporting on our progress as we pursue our goal of becoming America's Favorite Food Company in a way that expands operating profit margins, strengthens returns on invested capital, and posts profitable sales growth." Regarding the second half of fiscal 2004: o Based on past experience, the company generally expects its fourth quarter to be a more significant contributor than the third quarter to the company's yearly earnings. In addition, the company expects the fourth quarter to show a higher year-over-year EPS growth rate than the third quarter, reflecting the fact that charges were incurred in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year related to divesting the chicken processing operations. Major Items Affecting Year-Over-Year EPS Comparability Included in the results for the second quarter of fiscal 2004: o Current quarter results include charges of approximately $0.04 per diluted share related to the discontinued operations of UAP. Items in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 that are not repeated in the second quarter of fiscal 2004: o Prior year results include $0.03 per diluted share of expense from divesting the fresh beef and pork business.

UAP's results for the three months ending last August are included in the current quarter's results from discontinued operations since UAP is now classified as discontinued operations. Results for the three months ending November, which were a loss of approximately $22 million after tax and which would normally be reported next quarter, have been recorded directly to retained earnings. 26. The company refers to cost saving and operating improvement initiatives that have started and which will continue over the next several quarters. Does the company have any additional comments on that? o As part of efforts to improve the company's cost structure, margins, and competitive position, the company is currently implementing a series of initiatives that will better align and utilize the company's collective resources. o Implementing these initiatives started in the current quarter, and is expected to continue for the next few quarters. Theses initiatives include: >> Elimination of duplicative costs and overhead >> Consolidation of selected plants and support functions >> Efforts to streamline and improve our ability to do business with our customers, distributors and brokers >> Realignment of business organizations o Implementing these initiatives results in costs. In the current quarter, such costs were approximately $0.01 per share, and are included in the operating results for the Packaged Foods and Food Ingredients segments. For the remainder of fiscal 2004, those costs are expected to be $0.05 - $0.10 per share; these initiatives are expected to be more than offset by cost savings in the future. o The company expects to incur additional costs, and to subsequently realize cost savings greater than those additional costs, in future years as it gradually implements these initiatives. 27. Why has there been a change to historical segment classifications? Recently the company sold essentially all of UAP, its crop inputs distribution business. The company reclassified the Agricultural Products segment as discontinued operations. Therefore, historical results have been changed to reflect this move. Overall current and historical diluted EPS does not change as a result of the classification changes. 28. What are the revisions to historical segment results as a result of the classification change that took place this quarter? Please see the attached tables--one shows segment information, the other shows the entire P/L information.
