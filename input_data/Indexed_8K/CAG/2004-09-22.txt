FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONAGRA FOODS REPORTS STRONG FIRST QUARTER SALES WITH SOLID PROFITS; SHARE REPURCHASES CONTINUED DURING THE QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS: - ----------- o First quarter fiscal 2005 sales rose 8% to $3.5 billion, driven mostly by strong volume performance in the Retail Products segment. o First quarter fiscal 2005 diluted EPS of $0.26 includes $0.02 per share of previously announced costs related to implementing efficiency initiatives. o First quarter fiscal 2004 diluted EPS of $0.37 included contribution from businesses the company no longer owns and other items affecting year-over-year comparisons. Those items are detailed toward the end of this release. o Almost seven million shares were repurchased during the first quarter of fiscal 2005 for approximately $181 million. OMAHA, Neb., Sept. 22, 2004 -- ConAgra Foods Inc. (NYSE: CAG), one of North America's leading packaged food companies, today reported earnings for the first quarter ended Aug. 29, 2004. Net income for the quarter was $135 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, and includes $0.02 per share of previously announced costs related to implementing efficiency initiatives. Earnings for the first quarter last year were $195 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, reflecting contribution from businesses the company no longer owns, as well as other items that impact year-over-year comparability. Sales for the company increased 8% to $3.5 billion from $3.2 billion last year. Current quarter operating profit was $341 million, 9% above the $312 million reported last year. Current quarter income from continuing operations before income tax and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting was $214 million, 29% ahead of $166 million last fiscal year. Bruce Rohde, chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "Our first quarter sales were very strong, reflecting excellent volumes for many of our brands. Our sales and marketing initiatives are gaining significant momentum, and we are pleased with the progress." Rohde continued, "And because we have taken some price increases and reduced operating expenses in several areas, our overall operating profit this quarter was solid, but it was not as strong as we wanted; this was mainly due to significantly increased input costs across the industry. As we plan for the balance of this fiscal year, we expect to continue making price adjustments to offset increased input costs, as well as to continue growing volumes and capitalizing on cost savings opportunities so that we strengthen margins throughout the year." Retail Products (58% of total sales) Sales for the Retail Products segment increased 9% to $2 billion, the result of 8% volume growth. o Brands posting sales gains include: ACT II, Armour, Banquet, Blue Bonnet, Butterball, Chef Boyardee, Cook's, DAVID, Eckrich, Egg Beaters, Hebrew National, Hunt's, Kid Cuisine, Manwich, Marie Callender's, PAM, Parkay, Peter Pan, Reddi-wip, Swiss Miss, and Wesson; many of these increased at double-digit rates. o Sales for the company's top 30 brands as a group, which represent almost 80% of total segment sales, grew 9%; category share trends for many of the company's most significant brands showed solid year-over-year improvement. The strong volume performance reflects disciplined sales and marketing initiatives designed to continually strengthen brand equities, increase category shares, expand distribution, optimize return on marketing investment, and improve profit contribution from new items. The company notes that segment volume performance in the first quarter last fiscal year was soft, reflecting the consolidation of the Retail Products sales force underway at that time. This consolidation, now complete, reduced the role of brokers and resulted in a direct approach for serving customers. That transition has resulted in improved sales execution, which contributed to the strong volume performance this quarter. During the quarter, the segment's selling prices increased slightly, which only partly offset higher input costs; additional price increases continue to be implemented to address increased raw material costs. The Retail Products segment operating profit for the quarter was $213 million, 3% above the $208 million posted last year, reflecting the strong volume performance and a focus on operating cost reduction in the face of increased input costs. Significantly increased input costs negatively impacted operating profit growth and profit margin, as did $8 million of costs associated with implementing efficiency initiatives. Profits for branded processed meats were significantly below prior year results, reflecting a combination of increased costs and competitive challenges. The company expects price increases as well as the marketing and operating initiatives underway to accelerate the rate of operating profit growth for this segment as the fiscal year progresses. Foodservice Products (26% of total sales) Sales for the Foodservice Products segment were $905 million for the first quarter, an increase of 3% over last year, reflecting price increases that offset increased input costs. Sales for specialty potato and culinary products grew, while seafood sales declined due to market conditions. Segment operating profit for the quarter was $67 million, 11% below the $76 million posted last year, largely due to $11 million of unfavorable production costs associated with a planned plant consolidation. Results also include $5 million of costs associated with implementing efficiency initiatives. The company expects price increases as well as the marketing and operating initiatives underway to accelerate the rate of operating profit growth for this segment as the fiscal year progresses. Food Ingredients (16% of total sales) During the quarter, sales for the Food Ingredients segment increased 14% to $577 million from $508 million last year. Operating profit more than doubled to $60 million this year. The strong sales and operating profit increases are primarily the result of a favorable environment for input merchandising operations. Sales and operating profit results for the value-added specialty ingredients product lines were essentially equal to those of a year ago. Earnings from Equity Method Investments Equity method investment earnings for the quarter were $14 million, compared with $11 million for the same quarter last year. Capital Resource Management & Corporate Expense o The company repurchased nearly seven million shares of common stock during the first quarter at a total cost of approximately $181 million. Since announcing a $1 billion share repurchase program in December 2003, the company has repurchased approximately 22 million shares for a total cost of approximately $600 million. o Capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment totaled $105 million compared with $71 million last year; the increase over last year reflects additional investment in information systems. Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $89 million for the quarter versus $85 million a year ago. Dividends paid totaled $135 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $73 million compared with $65 million last year. o Corporate expense was $67 million for the quarter, compared with $92 million last year. Prior year amounts include approximately $22 million related to a litigation settlement. New Product News During the quarter the company announced its whole-grain flour, Ultragrain White Whole Wheat, its proprietary product that the company expects to be revolutionary in the baking industry. Ultragrain combines the nutritional benefits of whole grains with the taste, texture, and finished-baked qualities of refined flour that consumers and bakers often prefer. Ultragrain can be used in many applications including: bread, pizza crusts, pastas, tortillas, snacks, and cereals among other uses. Initial inquiries from potential trade customers including food manufacturers, bakeries, and ingredients companies suggest that the product has significant potential. Also during the quarter, Banquet Crock-Pot Classics, the first complete meal designed and created for Crock-Pot slow cooking, reached nationwide distribution, and is off to strong start. Banquet Crock-Pot Classics contain all of the high-quality ingredients needed for a slow-cooked meal--like tender meats, fresh vegetables, hearty potatoes, and perfectly seasoned sauces--and are ready to cook with less than five minutes of preparation, providing consumers with a convenient, on-demand homemade family meal. Outlook The company believes that the marketing and operating initiatives currently being implemented, along with appropriate price increases, and the share repurchase program, will drive a solid EPS performance this fiscal year; the company expects the benefit of its profit-enhancing initiatives and pricing actions to be more apparent in the company's profit margins (profit as a percentage of sales) during the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half.
