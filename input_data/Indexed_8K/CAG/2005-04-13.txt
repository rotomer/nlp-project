CONAGRA FOODS FILES THIRD-QUARTER 10-Q OMAHA, Neb., April 13, 2005 -- ConAgra Foods Inc. (NYSE: CAG), one of North America's leading packaged food companies, today filed its third quarter 10-Q, and in it restated historical results to correct errors in previously reported amounts relating to income tax matters. The quarterly filing shows diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter ended February 27, 2005 of $0.32. The company previously announced preliminary third quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.31. The change reflects the impact of final adjustments to the company's tax expense for the third quarter. In its news release of March 24, the company estimated the increased income tax expense to be in the range of $150 million - $200 million in aggregate, principally in fiscal years 2003-2004. However, the 10-Q filed today quantifies the net increased expense related to tax matters from fiscal 2002 through the first half of fiscal 2005 at approximately $105 million. The most significant errors that led to the restatement were in the areas of capital loss carry-forwards and foreign tax credits. Details including adjustments related to periods prior to fiscal 2002 are contained in the third quarter 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today. The company expects to file restated 10-Qs for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2005 as soon as possible - those 10-Qs will provide comparable prior-year information. The company also expects to file a restated fiscal 2004 10-K as soon as possible, which will contain quarterly EPS amounts for fiscal 2004 as well as fiscal 2003. # # #

Today we filed our 3rd quarter 10-Q after utilizing the 5-day grace period to complete our tax analyses. In the document (specifically in Note 13 of Item 1, Part 1, as well as in the financial information discussed in Item 2 of Part 1) are the details of the tax matters we mentioned in our earnings release on March 24, 2005. We encourage you to read the 10-Q document for all of the details we disclosed. You might find the following highlights helpful: o In the press release on March 24, our preliminary third quarter diluted EPS was $0.31. As a result of final adjustments to tax amounts, third quarter diluted EPS now rounds to $0.32. o In the third quarter earnings release, we detailed several items impacting EPS comparability. At that point, those items rounded to a net impact of $0.03 of expense per diluted share. Due to slight changes in taxes as well as rounding, those items now net to $0.02 of expense per diluted share. o In the press release on March 24, we estimated that the restatement correcting the errors would increase income tax expense in the range of $150 million - $200 million in aggregate, principally in fiscal years 2003-2004. As reflected in the 10-Q filed today, the total amount of increased expense related to tax matters from 2002 through the first half of fiscal 2005 has now been determined to be approximately $105 million. The most sizeable historical errors were in the areas of capital loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits. o Additionally, largely due to errors in deferred tax amounts, there is a $46 million reduction of income tax expense for years prior to 2002. Most of this is reflected as an increase in retained earnings for fiscal 2000. o There have been minor net adjustments to selling, general, and administrative expenses, and thus pre-tax profits, in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005. These net adjustments reflect the correction of amounts related to the company's sale of its minority investment in Swift Foods. o Certain restated fiscal year end amounts for 2001-2004, as well as certain restated quarterly information for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005, can be found in the financial information in Item 2 of Part 1. o The company will file restated 10-Qs for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2005 as soon as possible - those 10-Qs will provide comparable prior-year information. The company will also file a restated fiscal 2004 10-K as soon as possible, which will contain quarterly EPS amounts for fiscal 2004 as well as fiscal 2003. Thank you for your interest in our company.
