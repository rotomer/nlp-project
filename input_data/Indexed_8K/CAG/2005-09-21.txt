FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONAGRA FOODS REPORTS SOLID FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS FIRST-QUARTER FISCAL 2006 OVERVIEW: o First-quarter fiscal 2006 diluted EPS was $0.68, reflecting a large gain from selling 15.4 million shares of Pilgrim's Pride Corporation common stock as well as a solid performance in several areas of the business. >> The $0.68 per diluted share includes a $0.40 per share gain from the sale of Pilgrim's Pride Corporation common stock, $0.04 per share of expense from asset impairment and plant closure costs, and $0.01 per share of earnings from discontinued operations. These items impacting comparability are summarized toward the end of this release. >> Prior-year earnings of $0.26 per diluted share included $0.02 per share of net expense related to implementing cost-saving initiatives. o New chief executive officer Gary Rodkin will join ConAgra Foods on Oct. 1. OMAHA, Neb., Sept. 21, 2005 -- ConAgra Foods Inc. (NYSE: CAG), one of North America's leading packaged food companies, today reported results for the fiscal 2006 first quarter ended Aug. 28, 2005. First-quarter diluted EPS was $0.68, and diluted EPS was $0.26 for the same period last year; the major items affecting comparability are summarized toward the end of this release. Sales for the quarter were $3.4 billion, slightly less than the same period last year. Bruce Rohde, chairman and chief executive officer of ConAgra Foods, commented, "Operating profitability for fiscal 2006 is off to a good start. We are executing better in key areas of our business, and we are also encouraged by the fact that input cost inflation trends for some items are moderating following the significant cost increases we experienced in recent quarters. Fiscal 2006 should be a year of solid operating profit performance as we continue to improve our packaged meats operations and make our cost structure more efficient." Retail Products Segment (58% of company sales) During the quarter, sales for the Retail Products segment were $1.9 billion, a decrease of 4% compared with the same period last year; sales mix was slightly negative, as volume declined 3%. Sales and volume decreases reflect a combination of the effect of price increases, customer and product mix changes, continued challenges for some packaged meats products, and to a lesser extent, a rigorous SKU (stock keeping unit) reduction program. o Sales for the company's top 30 brands as a group, which represent approximately 80% of total segment sales, decreased 1% during the quarter. >> Several brands posted strong sales performance as a result of ongoing sales and marketing initiatives intended to strengthen brand equity and improve category share performance. Popular brands posting sales gains include: Butterball, Chef Boyardee, DAVID, Kid Cuisine, La Choy, Manwich, Marie Callender's, Orville Redenbacher's, Peter Pan, Slim Jim, Snack Pack, Van Camp's, and Wesson. >> Those brands posting sales declines include: ACT II, Armour, Banquet, Blue Bonnet, Cook's, Eckrich, Egg Beaters, Healthy Choice, Hebrew National, Hunt's, PAM, Parkay, Reddi-wip, and Swiss Miss. The Retail Products segment operating profit for the quarter was $211 million, slightly above the amount reported for the same quarter last year. Several factors contributed to the profit performance, including price increases across several product lines, more efficient manufacturing operations, and overall cost-management efforts. Those factors largely offset higher input costs for beef, steel, resin, and transportation. Profit margin trends for the packaged meats operations have improved from the trends experienced during the second half of fiscal 2005, even though profits for those operations are substantially below desired levels. The packaged meats operations are benefiting from new management and lower pork input costs, as well as better net pricing policies that are closely linked to SKU optimization efforts and product and customer mix improvement. The company is encouraged by the progress being made by the new packaged meats team, and continues to expect year-over-year profit improvement for these operations in the second half of fiscal 2006. $7 million of costs associated with a plant closure in the current year, and $8 million of costs associated with implementing efficiency initiatives in the prior year, impact year-over-year comparability of segment operating profit. Foodservice Products Segment (23% of company sales) Sales for the Foodservice Products segment were $790 million for the first quarter, roughly equal to the same period last year. Segment operating profit was $80 million in the first quarter, up from $66 million in the year-ago period. Last year's operating profit includes $5 million of costs associated with implementing efficiency initiatives as well as $11 million of unfavorable production costs associated with a planned plant consolidation. During the first quarter, specialty potato products and culinary products increased volumes with key customers. Growth in operating profits for specialty potato products and culinary products primarily reflects increased volumes and improved operating efficiencies. Due to tariff-related market dynamics, sales and profits for seafood products were below year-ago levels. Higher transportation costs for the overall segment were partially offset by effective cost-management efforts. Food Ingredients Segment (19% of company sales) During the quarter, sales for the Food Ingredients segment were $631 million, an increase of 9% compared with the first quarter last year. Segment operating profit was $76 million, an increase of 27% over the year-ago period; this increase was largely driven by a very favorable market environment for the commodity trading and merchandising operations. Those operations, which include trading and merchandising energy, grains, fertilizer, and other input commodities, contributed $47 million of the segment's total operating profit of $76 million. Despite a weak performance from the dehydrated product lines, the specialty ingredients products posted growth in sales and operating profit due to a strong performance from the flour milling operations. Pilgrim's Pride Stock Sale o During the quarter, ConAgra Foods sold all of its remaining 15.4 million shares of Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (NYSE: PPC) common stock for approximately $482 million, resulting in a net pretax gain of approximately $329 million. That gain is classified on the company's income statement as Gain on sale of Pilgrim's Pride Corporation common stock. ConAgra Foods acquired these shares in the fall of 2003 in connection with the divestiture of its chicken-processing operations to Pilgrim's Pride. Equity Method Investments, Corporate Expense, Capital Resource Matters, and Tax Rate o Equity method investments posted a pretax loss of $14 million for the first quarter, reflecting impairment charges totaling $19 million associated with two joint ventures. For the same quarter last year, equity method investment earnings were $14 million. Prior to the company's sale of its equity investment in Swift Foods during the second quarter of fiscal 2005, that investment provided $7 million of equity method investment earnings to ConAgra Foods during the first quarter of fiscal 2005. o For the first quarter, corporate expense was $73 million, compared with $64 million for the same period a year ago. o For the quarter, capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment totaled $71 million compared with $105 million last year. Depreciation and amortization expense was approximately $89 million for the quarter versus $88 million a year ago. Dividends paid totaled $141 million versus $135 million last year. Net interest expense for the quarter was $68 million compared with $73 million last year. o At the end of the first quarter, interest-bearing debt was $4.5 billion, compared with $5.7 billion for the same period a year ago. Because of debt prepayments made in fiscal 2005, the company has only $126 million of debt scheduled to be paid in fiscal 2006. As of the end of the first quarter, the company had more than $500 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. o The company benefited from an effective tax rate of approximately 36% in the quarter; that rate is slightly less than the 38% effective tax rate in the first quarter of last year. The company currently expects the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 to be in line with that of the first quarter. New CEO and New Chairman of the Board Recently the company announced that Gary Rodkin will become the company's new president and chief executive officer and a member of its board of directors on Oct. 1. He will succeed Bruce Rohde, the current chief executive officer. Board member Steven F. Goldstone has been elected the non-executive chairman, commencing Oct. 1. Mr. Goldstone is a retired chairman and chief executive officer of RJR Nabisco, and succeeds Bruce Rohde, the company's current chairman. Outlook As previously stated, the company continues to expect fiscal 2006 EPS to be higher than fiscal 2005 EPS, excluding amounts that impact comparability. That earnings improvement is expected to be more apparent in the second half of the fiscal year as the company makes more progress working through the issues that have negatively impacted the packaged meats operations. Major Items Affecting First-Quarter Fiscal 2006 EPS Comparability Included in diluted EPS of $0.68 for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 (EPS amounts after tax): o A gain of $0.40 per diluted share from the sale of Pilgrim's Pride Corporation common stock that is classified as such on the company's income statement. o Expense of $0.03 per diluted share resulting from impairment charges associated with two joint ventures. These amounts are included in the equity method investment results. o Expense of $0.01 per diluted share related to plant closure costs classified as part of the results for the Retail Products segment. o Income of $0.01 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Included in the $0.26 diluted EPS for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 (EPS amounts after tax): o Expense of approximately $0.02 per diluted share related to implementing cost-saving initiatives.
