FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
CONAGRA FOODS REPORTS FISCAL 2006 FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS
Solid Operating Performance; Three of Four Segments
Post Operating Profit Growth
Fiscal 2007 EPS Outlook Increased Based on 8.7 Million Shares
Repurchased This Quarter
 
OMAHA, Neb., June 28, 2006  ConAgra Foods Inc. (NYSE: CAG), one of North America's leading packaged food companies, today reported results for the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter ended May 28, 2006. Fourth-quarter fiscal 2006 diluted earnings per share were $0.21, including $0.11 per share of net expense from items that impact comparability. Excluding the $0.11 per share of net expense from items that impact comparability, fourth-quarter diluted EPS was $0.32. Diluted EPS in the year-ago period was $0.20, which included $0.06 of net expense from items that impact comparability.
 
 
 
Gary Rodkin, ConAgra Foods' chief executive officer, commented, "We had a solid finish to the fiscal year, but more importantly, we finalized key aspects of our organizational restructuring and plant rationalization initiatives that will result in improved efficiencies." He continued, "As we communicated when we outlined our three-year plans last March, we expect fiscal 2007 to show a more efficient cost structure and appropriately focused marketing investment. Our entire organization is very focused on achieving our fiscal 2007 financial goals."
 
During the quarter, the company began reporting its operations in four segments: Consumer Foods, Food and Ingredients, Trading and Merchandising, and International Foods. Historical segment results have been adjusted to reflect the segment changes.

Consumer Foods Segment (57% of annual sales)
Branded consumer products sold in retail and foodservice channels;
excludes international consumer operations.
 
During the quarter, sales for the Consumer Foods segment were $1.6 billion, roughly equal to the same period last year, reflecting pricing gains that mostly offset a 2% volume decline.
 
 
 
 
 
Segment operating profit was $188 million for the quarter, 2% ahead of $184 million reported last year. Excluding restructuring charges of $44 million in the current quarter and $28 million of severance costs in the year-ago period, current quarter operating profit grew 9% despite an increase in marketing investment; the comparable profit growth reflects productivity gains and improved product mix.
 
Food and Ingredients Segment
(
28% of annual sales)
Specialty potato, dehydrated vegetable, seasonings, blends, flavors, and milled products
sold to foodservice and commercial channels worldwide.
 
 
more
 
CONAGRA FOODS

During the quarter, sales for the Food and Ingredients
segment were $823 million, 6% ahead of last year, reflecting strong volume growth from Lamb Weston specialty potato operations, improved volume, pricing, and mix for dehydrated garlic, onion, and vegetable products, and increased flour selling prices driven by higher input costs.
 
Segment operating profit was $93 million for the quarter, 22% ahead of $77 million reported last year, reflecting the strength of the potato and dehydrated products operations. There were restructuring charges of $5 million in the current quarter and $3 million of severance costs in the year-ago period.
 
Trading and Merchandising Segment (10% of annual sales)
Trading and merchandising agricultural commodities, fertilizer, and energy worldwide.
 
During the quarter, sales for the Trading and Merchandising segment were $359 million, 16% below year-ago amounts; the decrease was driven mostly by lower volumes and selling prices for wholesale fertilizer operations as well as less favorable trading conditions for energy-related products. Segment operating profit was $36 million, 35% below year-ago amounts. The operating profit decrease reflects substantially lower profits from energy-related products and fertilizer, although profits from agricultural commodities such as livestock, grains, and by-products increased.
 
 
International Foods Segment (5% of annual sales)
Branded consumer products sold internationally to retail channels.
 
During the quarter, sales for the International Foods segment were $156 million, roughly equal to the same period last year.
 
Segment operating profit was $23 million for the quarter, 14% ahead of $20 million reported last year, primarily reflecting a strong sales performance from mix improvements driven by popcorn and canned pasta. Results for Canada and Mexico, the largest of the company's international markets,

Discontinued Operations
During the second half of fiscal 2006, ConAgra Foods announced the intended divestiture of its ham, seafood, packaged meats, and cheese operations. Those businesses, which represented aggregate annual revenue of approximately $2.8 billion, have been reclassified as discontinued operations. During the fourth quarter, the company completed the sale of its ham and seafood businesses.
 
Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.12 for the quarter, which includes the gain on divestitures of $0.07 per share. Excluding that item, EPS from discontinued operations was $0.05 for the quarter.

Impact of Recent Share Repurchases on Outlook
At its March 2006 Analyst and Investor Event, the company estimated that fiscal 2007 EPS from continuing operations would be in the range of $1.10 - $1.15. Those amounts did not reflect any EPS benefit from allocating divestiture proceeds towards share repurchases or debt reduction. Those amounts also do not reflect items that could impact comparability, including but not limited to restructuring and impairment charges and gains and losses on sales of assets; the timing of such events and therefore the impact on fiscal 2007 EPS cannot be estimated at this time.
 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the company repurchased approximately $197 million of its stock; this is expected to add approximately $0.02 of annual benefit to the previously cited EPS goals.
 
Regarding divestitures yet to be completed, the company notes that the plans are proceeding as expected. To the extent that the company completes any significant transactions in fiscal 2007, it is uncertain whether the company would receive proceeds in time for any resulting share repurchases or debt reduction to significantly impact the EPS outlook for fiscal 2007. This reflects the customary delay between reaching an agreement and receiving proceeds, and the fact that the company may conduct its share repurchases at only certain times within the fiscal year.
 
Quarterly Earnings Patterns in Fiscal 2007
The company expects to achieve its fiscal 2007 EPS target of $1.12 - $1.17 from continuing operations, which includes the $0.02 benefit discussed above and does not reflect items that could impact comparability. The company is not offering guidance with regard to contribution from discontinued operations, as those are expected to be sold during the fiscal year. The company has the following quarterly expectations for EPS from continuing operations, excluding items that impact comparability, in fiscal 2007:

Gross Margin = Gross Profit* divided by Net Sales
Gross Margin = $700/$2,975 = 23.5%
 
Operating Margin = Segment Operating Profit** divided by Net Sales
Operating Margin = $340/$2,975 = 11.4%
 
* Gross Profit = Net Sales  Costs of Goods Sold ($2,975  $2,275 = $700)
 
**See fourth-quarter segment operating results for a reconciliation of Operating Profit to Income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity method investment earnings (loss). Income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity method investment earnings (loss), divided by Net Sales = $72/$2,975 = 2.4%.
 
 
Trade working capital is defined as the net position of Accounts Receivable plus Inventory less Current Operating Liabilities (Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, and Advances on Sales).
 
 
 
 
* Total debt = notes payable, short-term debt, long-term debt, and subordinated debt.
 
 
At the end of the fourth quarter, interest-bearing debt was approximately $3.6 billion, reflecting the redemption of $250 million of the company's 7.875% senior debt due September 2010; $500 million of that senior debt is still outstanding. The current portion of long-term debt reflects $400 million of 7.125% senior debt due October 2026 that has been reclassified because of a put option that is exercisable by the holders of the debt from Aug. 1, 2006 to Sept. 1, 2006. Based on current market conditions, the company does not anticipate the holders to exercise the put option, and therefore expects to reclassify the $400 million debt back into senior long-term debt after Sept. 1, 2006 when the put option expires.
