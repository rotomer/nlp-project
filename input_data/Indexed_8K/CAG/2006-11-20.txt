The applicable total exchange price will include an early participation payment payable only to holders of Old Notes that validly tender and do not validly withdraw their Old Notes prior to 5:00 p.m., on New York City time, December 4, 2006 (such time and date, the "Early Participation Date"), subject to extension, and whose Old Notes are accepted for exchange.
           
Old Notes tendered before the Early Participation Date may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Early Participation Date.  Old Notes tendered after the Early Participation Date may be validly withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration of the exchange offer.
           
The new notes will mature on June 15, 2017 and will bear interest at an annual rate, which will be determined two business days prior to the expiration of the exchange offer.
