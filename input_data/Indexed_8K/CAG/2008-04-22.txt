Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
 
On April 18, 2008, the Board of Directors of ConAgra Foods, Inc. (the Company) authorized a plan designed to improve the efficiency of the Companys Consumer Foods and related functional organizations. This activity is the extension of a plan adopted on February 14, 2008 by the Board of Directors to streamline the Companys international operations. Together, these actions are intended to reduce manufacturing and selling, general and administrative costs, and improve operating margins. Prior to the Boards action on April 18, 2008, the level of cash and non-cash accounting charges expected to be incurred to execute the program was not material. As a single program, the Company expects to incur the following charges:
 
 
Included in these estimates are approximately $39 million of charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows. The plan is expected to be substantially implemented within 12 months.
 
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
Savings expected to be generated from the plan described in Item 2.05 of this Form 8-K are a component of the selling, general and administrative reductions assumed in the Companys most recently released fiscal year 2009 guidance for earnings from continuing operations of at least $1.55 per share, excluding any items impacting comparability.
