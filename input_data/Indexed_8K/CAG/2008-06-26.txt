FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
OMAHA, Neb., June 26, 2008  ConAgra Foods, Inc., (NYSE: CAG) one of North America's leading packaged food companies, today reported results for the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter ended May 25, 2008. Overall sales grew 15% and diluted EPS from continuing operations grew 38%. Current-quarter diluted EPS (continuing and discontinued operations) was $0.41, which includes net $0.03 per diluted share of expense from items impacting comparability. Prior-year diluted EPS (continuing and discontinued operations) of $0.39 included net $0.01 per diluted share of expense from items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability in the current and prior year are summarized toward the end of this release.
Gary Rodkin, chief executive officer of ConAgra Foods, commented, "In fiscal 2008, we made progress in several important areas of our company, most notably pricing, the innovation pipeline, more effective marketing, and efficiencies. While our higher-than-planned fourth quarter EPS largely reflects another strong performance from the Trading & Merchandising operations, we are also pleased with the improved execution demonstrated in our continuing operations. Given the operating progress made this fiscal year as well as the recent divestiture of our Trading & Merchandising operations, we have an even greater focus on successfully executing the initiatives in our core food operations, as well as a much stronger foundation on which to deliver predictable and sustainable profitable growth going forward."

The following summary of segment sales and operating profit performance reflects activities within continuing operations. EPS of $0.23 per diluted share from discontinued operations, discussed toward the end of this document, reflects a strong performance from the company's Trading & Merchandising operations. The company notes that the reclassification of certain results from continuing operations to discontinued operations during the quarter was due largely to the divestiture of the Trading & Merchandising operations; current and historical financial results reflect this change in classification.
 
 
The Consumer Foods segment posted sales of $1.7 billion and operating profit of $167 million for the quarter.
The following Consumer Foods segment commentary relates to comparable performance unless otherwise indicated.
Consumer Foods' comparable sales growth was 4%, reflecting a 5% increase in net realized pricing and a 1% decrease in volume. Significant net pricing actions for the company's consumer products were implemented with customers March 24 and thus were in effect for approximately two months of the quarter; future quarters will reflect the full quarterly impact of these price increases.

Operating profit of $167 million was slightly ahead of last year, as reported, and declined 5% on a comparable basis as detailed on page 9; this represents a significant improvement from recent quarterly trends. This sequential improvement was largely driven by recent price increases. Although the company continued to successfully implement cost-saving initiatives, these were more than offset by input cost inflation in the range of $150 million. The company expects the Consumer Foods segment to perform well in fiscal 2009 given the strength of the innovation pipeline, recent and planned pricing actions, and the cost-saving initiatives in place.
During the quarter, sales for the Food and Ingredients segment were $1.2 billion, 32% ahead of last year. Sales for the milling operations grew as higher wheat costs were passed on as higher selling prices; Lamb Weston specialty potato and appetizer operations benefited from improved pricing and product mix as well as volume growth in export markets, the combination of which more than offset the impact of significant inflation. Sales results for dehydrated products and seasoning blends grew due to new initiatives with key customers. The recent acquisition of Watts Brothers Farms contributed approximately 2 points of sales growth to the overall segment, and the company notes that the integration of the business is going smoothly. Segment operating profit was $115 million for the quarter, 9% ahead of year-ago amounts, due to the strong sales results discussed above and a focus on efficiencies.

During the quarter, sales for the International Foods segment were $185 million, 17% ahead of year-ago amounts, largely due to strong performances for popcorn, tomato, canned pasta, and snack products in key markets. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates contributed 7 points of sales growth. Canada and Mexico, the largest geographic markets in the segment, posted strong overall sales growth.
As reported, operating profit of $11 million was 39% below the $18 million earned in the year-ago period, primarily due to $10 million of restructuring costs incurred in the current quarter to improve future operating efficiencies. Excluding these restructuring costs in the current quarter, operating profit was ahead of year-ago amounts, reflecting sales growth as well as a focus on efficiencies.

Discontinued Operations
During the quarter, diluted EPS from discontinued operations was $0.23 as reported, which includes $0.02 per diluted share of net expense from items impacting comparability, most of which relates to an unusually high tax rate. These earnings were largely driven by the Trading & Merchandising operations, now classified as discontinued operations, which had strong results in wholesale fertilizer operations and agricultural commodities merchandising. The Trading & Merchandising operations were sold after the fiscal year-end. Current-quarter discontinued operations also include results for the Knott's Berry Farm brand, including a small pretax gain on the sale of that brand, which occurred on May 13, 2008.
Outlook
The company expects EPS from continuing operations, excluding items impacting comparability, to be in the range of $1.56-$1.59 in fiscal 2009. Reflecting the seasonality of operating results as well as the fact that the planned share-repurchase and debt-reduction activities are not expected to be completed until the end of the first half of fiscal 2009, the company expects diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 to be in the range of $0.26-$0.28. This first-quarter outlook excludes items impacting comparability. The company will comment on its outlook in the regularly scheduled earnings releases throughout the year. The company notes that fiscal 2009 has 53 weeks.
