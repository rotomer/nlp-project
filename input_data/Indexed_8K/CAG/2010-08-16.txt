Item 8.01 Other Events.
Today, August 16, 2010, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced the filing and simultaneous settlement of a charge against the former ConAgra Trade Group, Inc. ("CTG"), through its successor-in-interest (the "Successor"), for allegedly causing a non bona-fide price to be reported on the New York Mercantile Exchange on January 2, 2008. ConAgra Foods, Inc. ("ConAgra Foods") is not a named party in the settlement. The Successor is not an affiliate of ConAgra Foods. ConAgra Foods sold CTG in June 2008 as part of its divestiture of the trading and merchandising reporting segment. During the current quarter, ConAgra Foods will pay the Successors parent $4.3 million, an amount that eliminates any potential for a dispute to arise with the Successors parent over liability for this matter. During fiscal 2010, ConAgra Foods recognized charges within discontinued operations in anticipation of resolution of this matter.
