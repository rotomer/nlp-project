Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On December 20, 2011, ConAgra Foods, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release and posted a question and answer document ("Q&A") on its website containing information on the Company's second quarter fiscal 2012 financial results. The press release and Q&A are furnished with this Form 8-K as exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively.
The press release and Q&A include the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted operating profit for the Consumer Foods segment, adjusted unallocated corporate expense, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and net debt. Management considers GAAP financial measures as well as such non-GAAP financial information in its evaluation of the Company's financial statements and believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information to assess the Company's operating performance and financial position. These measures are reconciled in the press release and Q&A to the most directly comparable measures as reported in accordance with GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Company's diluted earnings per share and operating performance and financial measures as calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Second-quarter Fiscal 2012 Highlights (vs. year-ago amounts):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
OMAHA, Neb., Dec. 20, 2011  ConAgra Foods, Inc., (NYSE: CAG) one of North America's leading packaged food companies, today reported results for the fiscal 2012 second quarter ended Nov. 27, 2011. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.41, including $0.06 per diluted share of net expense from items impacting comparability. Adjusting for those items, diluted EPS

page 2
 
from continuing operations was $0.47. For the same period a year ago, diluted EPS from continuing operations as reported and adjusted for items impacting comparability was $0.45. Items impacting comparability in the second quarter of the current year and prior year are summarized toward the end of this release and reconciled for Regulation G purposes starting on page 9.
Gary Rodkin, ConAgra Foods' chief executive officer, commented, "We are pleased with our progress in both operating segments. The quarter's higher-than-planned comparable EPS reflects strong double-digit operating profit growth for our Commercial Foods segment, which has successfully overcome difficult operating conditions and implemented pricing. We are encouraged by our progress in fighting inflation in the Consumer Foods segment; volumes for that segment have performed largely as expected given ongoing price increases. The marketplace environment remains difficult due to continuing inflationary pressures and the impact of the current economy on consumers, so we are cautious about business conditions. Our team is managing through these circumstances well by focusing on net price realization, productivity, and appropriate brand support, and we are confident in our ability to deliver our overall EPS and cash flow expectations for the fiscal year."
The Consumer Foods segment posted sales of $2,178 million for the fiscal second quarter, up 4% year-over-year due to price/mix contribution of 5% and a 1% volume decline.
 
 
Operating profit of $256 million was 8% below last year's $279 million, as reported. Restructuring charges of $15 million in the current quarter and $5 million in the year-ago period are included in reported results; adjusting for these amounts, current quarter operating profit of $271 million was
 
CONAGRA FOODS
page 3
 
4% below the comparable $284 million in the year-ago period. In terms of operating profit impact, the combination of pricing and strong cost savings almost offset inflation of 10% this quarter; marketing investment was slightly higher, as planned.
The company is encouraged by its pricing progress to date, and remains cautious in its near-term outlook for this segment largely due to upwardly revised estimates for near-term inflation and the possibility of further volume impact given ongoing pricing initiatives. Largely reflecting the timing of inflation and marketing investments, the company expects this segment's second-half operating profit growth to occur in the fiscal fourth quarter.
Sales for the Commercial Foods segment were $1,226 million, 16% above year-ago amounts; the growth reflects the pass-through of higher wheat costs in the milling operations as well as price increases at Lamb Weston potato operations necessitated by high operating costs. The segment's sales performance also reflects volume growth for the major product lines.
The segment's operating profit increased 26% to $161 million, which was higher than planned. The segment's most significant profit improvement came from the Lamb Weston operations, which benefited from pricing actions taken over the last few months to address input cost inflation; Lamb Weston also benefited from operating efficiencies and volume growth. Sweet potato products for the foodservice channel and branded products in the retail channel continue to demonstrate momentum, helping drive favorable mix. The milling operations also posted improved profitability due to favorable market conditions, efficiencies and mix.
Alexia
As previously communicated, the company expects this segment to post improved year-over-year profitability in the second half of the year.

Hedging Activities 
This language primarily relates to operations other than the company's milling operations.
The company recorded $27 million of net hedging loss as unallocated Corporate expense in the current quarter, and $9 million of net hedging gain as unallocated Corporate expense in the year-ago period. The company identifies these amounts as items impacting comparability. Those amounts are reclassified from unallocated Corporate expense to the operating segments when the underlying commodity or foreign currency being hedged is expensed in segment cost of goods sold (COGS).

Fiscal 2012 Guidance Reaffirmed  Second-half Details
The company continues to expect fiscal 2012 full-year diluted EPS, adjusted for items impacting comparability, to grow at a low- to mid-single-digit rate over the comparable $1.75 earned last fiscal year. The fiscal year's EPS expectations reflect the benefit of the strong performance in the fiscal second quarter and recent acquisitions, as well as upwardly revised inflation estimates and continued challenging business conditions in the second half of the year. The company currently estimates that inflation for the Consumer Foods segment will be in the range of 10% for the full fiscal year. Based on its assessment of the overall business climate as well as the nature of the quarterly year-over-year EPS comparisons, the company expects its fiscal 2012 second-half EPS growth to be concentrated in the fiscal fourth quarter.
