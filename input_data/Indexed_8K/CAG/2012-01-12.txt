Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On January 10, 2012, ConAgra Foods, Inc. (the "Company") replaced its existing commercial paper program by entering into a new commercial paper program (the "Program"), pursuant to which the Company may issue, on a private placement basis, unsecured commercial paper notes (the "Notes") up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.5 billion. Under the Program, which is backed up by the Companys $1.5 billion multi-year revolving credit facility, the Company may issue the Notes from time to time. The proceeds from the Notes will be used to finance the Companys short-term liquidity needs. The Company intends to use the Program in a form consistent with its capital allocation priorities that include maintaining its investment grade rating and strong balance sheet. The maturities of the Notes will vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The Notes will be sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and will be issued at a discount from par, or, alternatively, will be sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.
