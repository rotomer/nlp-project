Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On March 22, 2012, ConAgra Foods, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release and posted a question and answer document ("Q&A") on its website containing information on the Company's third quarter fiscal 2012 financial results. The press release and Q&A are furnished with this Form 8-K as exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively and incorporated herein by reference.
The press release and Q&A include the non-GAAP financial measures of diluted earnings per share, adjusted for items impacting comparability, adjusted operating profit for the Consumer Foods segment, adjusted operating profit for the Commercial Foods segment, adjusted unallocated corporate expense, and net debt. Management considers GAAP financial measures as well as such non-GAAP financial information in its evaluation of the Company's financial statements and believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information to assess the Company's operating performance and financial position. The historical non-GAAP measures are reconciled in the press release and Q&A to the most directly comparable measures as reported in accordance with GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Company's diluted earnings per share and operating performance and financial measures as calculated in accordance with GAAP. The inability to predict the amount and timing of discretionary pension funding and other future items makes a detailed reconciliation of projections of operating cash flows, before the impact of discretionary pension funding, and effective tax rate, adjusted for items impacting comparability, impracticable.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Third-quarter Fiscal 2012 Highlights (vs. year-ago amounts):
 
 
 
 
 
 
OMAHA, Neb., March 22, 2012  ConAgra Foods, Inc., (NYSE: CAG) one of North America's leading packaged food companies, today reported results for the fiscal 2012 third quarter ended Feb. 26, 2012. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.65 as reported, up 25% over $0.52 a year ago. After adjusting for $0.14 of net EPS benefit in the current quarter, and $0.02 of net EPS benefit in the year-ago period, from items impacting comparability, diluted EPS of $0.51 from continuing operations in the fiscal third quarter increased 2% over the comparable $0.50 in the year-ago period. Items impacting comparability in the third quarter of the current fiscal year and prior fiscal year are summarized toward the end of this release and reconciled for Regulation G purposes starting on page 9.

Gary Rodkin, ConAgra Foods' chief executive officer, commented, "Conditions have been difficult across the industry due to high inflation and soft volumes for retail consumer food brands. Our Lamb Weston potato business performed well, and we benefited from total margin management efforts that include price increases in both operating segments and good overall cost savings. We remain committed to our EPS goals for fiscal 2012, and we will continue our focus on deploying cash in ways that create long-term value."
The Consumer Foods segment posted sales of $2,157 million for the fiscal third quarter, up 4% year over year; the sales increase reflects a 5% contribution from favorable price/mix, a 5% organic volume decline, and a 4% contribution from recent acquisitions. The 5% organic volume decline reflects challenging industry conditions and the company's additional recent price increases.
 
 
 
Operating profit of $331 million was 20% above $276 million a year ago, as reported. Current-quarter amounts include $59 million of gain resulting from the recent acquisition of a majority interest in Agro Tech Foods, Ltd., as well as approximately $8 million of restructuring costs. Prior-year amounts include approximately $22 million of restructuring costs. After adjusting for these
 
CONAGRA FOODS

items, current-quarter segment operating profit declined 6% from comparable amounts last year due to very high input cost inflation. As expected , input cost inflation in the fiscal third quarter was the most severe of any this fiscal year, at 11%, and more than offset the benefit of strong price and cost-oriented margin management initiatives as well as profit contribution from recent acquisitions. Despite difficult industry conditions that have softened the near-term outlook for this segment, the company expects modest comparable year-over-year profit growth for this segment in the fiscal fourth quarter largely due to an expected slowdown in the rate of inflation.
Fiscal third-quarter sales for the Commercial Foods segment were $1,216 million, 14% above year-ago amounts. The sales growth reflects the benefit of commodity-driven price increases and increased volumes for the Lamb Weston potato operations, as well as the pass-through of higher wheat costs in the milling operations. Other product lines in the segment posted good top-line results.
The segment's operating profit increased 7% to $150 million as reported; after adjusting for $10 million of restructuring charges in prior-year amounts, current-quarter operating profit was essentially in line with comparable year-ago amounts. Lamb Weston improved profit performance through pricing actions, volume growth, and productivity gains, which collectively offset a profit decline in the milling operations. The profit decline for the milling operations was driven by a difficult comparison given a very strong performance in the year-ago period, as well as less favorable market conditions. Improved mix, notably through sales growth for sweet potatoes and whole grains, favorably impacted segment results.
The company expects this segment to post strong profit growth in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year given pricing actions already taken, momentum with potato volumes, and the nature of the quarterly comparison.

Hedging Activities 
This language primarily relates to operations other than the company's milling operations.
The company recorded $22 million of net hedging benefit within unallocated Corporate expense in the current quarter, and $24 million of net hedging benefit as unallocated Corporate expense in the year-ago period. The company identifies these amounts as items impacting comparability. Those amounts are reclassified from unallocated Corporate expense to the operating segments when the underlying commodity or foreign currency being hedged is expensed in segment cost of goods sold (COGS).

Fiscal Fourth Quarter EPS Growth
While business conditions remain difficult and have softened the company's near-term EPS outlook, the company expects modest year-over-year EPS growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, adjusted for items impacting comparability. The growth is expected to be driven by continued momentum with potato products in the Commercial Foods segment, an anticipated slowdown in the rate of inflation in the Consumer Foods segment, and the overall nature of the comparison.

Q3 FY12 Question & Answer
March 22, 2012
 
 
Sales for and were in line with last year's sales for the quarter.
Parkay
Ro*Tel
 
 
 
Consumer Foods organic unit volume decreased 5%.
Commercial Foods volume increased 3%.
 
Approximately $91 million (versus approximately $90 million in Q3 FY11)
 
Approximately $79 million (versus approximately $136 million in Q3 FY11)
 
Approximately $50 million (versus approximately $52 million in Q3 FY11).
Approximately $65 million for the quarter (versus approximately $23 million in Q3 FY11). The current quarter includes $22 million of net hedge benefit, as well as $12 million of net expense due to adjustments for historical legal and insurance matters. Prior-year amounts include $24 million of net hedge benefit and $25 million of benefit from a debtor's prepayment of a note receivable. Excluding these amounts, corporate expense was $75 million for the current quarter and $72 million in the year-ago period.
 
Approximately $99 million (versus approximately $100 million in Q3 FY11). The year-over-year decrease reflects fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by a higher dividend rate.
 
The company repurchased approximately $7 million of its shares of common stock during Q3 FY12; the company has approximately $775 million remaining on its outstanding share repurchase authorizations.
 
Approximately 420 million shares for the quarter
 
Gross margin = segment gross profit* divided by net sales
Gross margin = $768/$3,373 = 23%
Operating margin = segment operating profit** divided by net sales
Operating margin = $481/$3,373 = 14%
 
 
 
 
 
The net debt to total capital ratio for the quarter was 31%.
This ratio is defined as net debt divided by the sum of net debt plus shareholder equity. See question No. #12 for the components of net debt.
 
The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the quarter was approximately 28% as reported, lower than planned, largely due to a gain resulting from the acquisition of a majority interest in Agro Tech Foods, Ltd. This gain is not subject to taxes, and it is treated as an item impacting comparability. The company expects the effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2012 to be approximately 34%, excluding items impacting comparability.
 
The company continues to expect the continuing operations effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2012 to be approximately 34%, adjusted for items impacting comparability.
 
Total capital expenditures for FY12 are expected to be approximately $400 million.
 
Net interest expense for FY12 is expected to be approximately $200 million.
 
Because we recently became a majority owner in Agro Tech Foods, Ltd., of India (ATFL), we now consolidate the results for ATFL for financial statement reporting purposes and no longer include results for our portion of ATFL earnings in our Equity Method Investment Earnings line. This change was effective as of the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2012 and does not impact prior periods. ATFL's operating results are included with the results of our Consumer Foods segment. We remove the portion of ATFL income that belongs to other ATFL shareholders in our calculation of net income attributable to ConAgra Foods, Inc., as shown on our consolidated statement of earnings.
