Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
On May 31, 2012, a jury in federal court in E. St. Louis, Missouri returned a verdict against ConAgra Foods, Inc. (the "Company") and Westside Salvage (the "Subcontractor") in favor of three employees of the Subcontractor who suffered injuries when they were involved in an accident at the Companys Chester, Illinois flour milling facility in April of 2010. The verdict was in the amount of approximately $77 million in compensatory damages apportioned between the Company and the Subcontractor and $100 million in punitive damages against the Company. While the Company has insurance policies in place that it believes will cover the full amount of the compensatory and punitive damages (other than a $3 million deductible that we accrued in a prior period), the Company intends to further defend its actions and practices, including an appeal of the verdict and the damages. Safety has been and remains the top priority of the Company.
