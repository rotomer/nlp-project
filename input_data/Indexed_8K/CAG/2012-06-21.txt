Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On June 21, 2012, ConAgra Foods, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release and posted a question and answer document ("Q&A") on its website containing information on the Company's fourth quarter fiscal 2012 financial results. The press release and Q&A are furnished with this Form 8-K as exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
The press release and Q&A include the non-GAAP financial measures of diluted earnings per share adjusted for items impacting comparability; adjusted operating profit for the Consumer Foods segment; adjusted unallocated corporate expense; and net debt. Management considers GAAP financial measures as well as such non-GAAP financial information in its evaluation of the Company's financial statements and believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information to assess the Company's operating performance and financial position. The historical non-GAAP measures are reconciled in the press release and Q&A to the most directly comparable measures as reported in accordance with GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Company's diluted earnings per share and operating performance and financial measures as calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

OMAHA, Neb., June 21, 2012  ConAgra Foods, Inc., (NYSE: CAG) one of North America's leading packaged food companies, today reported results for the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter ended May 27, 2012. Due to an accounting change, the fourth quarter fiscal 2012 loss per share from continuing operations was $(0.21) as reported, down versus fiscal 2011 fourth-quarter reported EPS of $0.61. After adjusting for $0.72 of net expense in the current quarter, and $0.14 net benefit in the year-ago period, from items impacting comparability, diluted EPS of $0.51 from continuing operations in the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter increased 9% vs. the comparable $0.47 in the year-ago period. Items impacting comparability in the current fiscal year and prior fiscal year are summarized toward the end of this release and reconciled for Regulation G purposes starting on page 11.
Gary Rodkin, ConAgra Foods' chief executive officer, commented, "Although the business environment remains challenging, we posted comparable year-over-year EPS growth for the fiscal fourth quarter, as planned. The Consumer Foods segment posted comparable year-over-year profit growth for the fiscal fourth quarter due to contribution from acquired businesses, moderating inflation, and progress with pricing and other margin management initiatives. This represents a significant turning point in the year-over-year profit comparisons for this segment given the industry conditions that have weighed on this segment's results over the past several quarters. In the Commercial Foods segment, the Lamb Weston potato operations continued to post strong growth in sales and profits, demonstrating momentum that we expect to continue into fiscal 2013."
He continued, "As we look to fiscal 2013, we expect good earnings growth. We will lap the pricing increases taken in fiscal 2012, which should benefit the year-over-year organic volume performance for our Consumer Foods segment in the second half of the fiscal year. Contribution from acquisitions completed in fiscal 2012, momentum in our potato operations, moderating inflation, and strong margin management initiatives should allow us to overcome the impact of marketplace challenges."

The Consumer Foods segment posted sales of $2,150 million for the fiscal fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year; the sales increase reflects a 6% contribution from favorable price/mix, 6% contribution from acquisitions, and a 5% organic volume decline. The impact of foreign exchange weighed on sales growth by approximately 1%. The 5% organic volume decline reflects the difficult economic conditions that are impacting consumer purchasing behavior, as well as price increases taken earlier in the year. The brand drove a meaningful portion of the segment's overall volume decline given the sizeable price increases taken earlier in the fiscal year for that brand.

Operating profit of $270 million decreased 26% from $364 million in the year-ago period, as reported. After adjusting for $18 million of net expense in the current quarter and $95 million of net benefit in the year-ago period from items impacting comparability, current-quarter operating profit of $288 million grew 7% over $270 million in the year-ago period. As expected, a combination of contributions from acquisitions, pricing actions, and other margin management initiatives more than offset the impact of lower volumes and inflation. While the quarter's inflation rate of 6% was still challenging, it has moderated from the double-digit rates seen in quarters earlier this fiscal year.
This segment is expected to post profit growth in fiscal 2013 primarily due to contributions from businesses acquired in fiscal 2012, but also due to moderating inflation and effective margin

management initiatives. As fiscal 2013 progresses, the company will lap the price increases taken in fiscal 2012, which should benefit the year-over-year volume performance of the Consumer Foods segment in the second half of the fiscal year.
Fiscal fourth-quarter sales for the Commercial Foods segment were $1,264 million, 7% above year-ago amounts. The sales growth reflects increased volumes for Lamb Weston potato operations and the flour milling operations. Sales growth also reflects price increases across the segment made necessary by input cost inflation.
The segment's operating profit increased 7% to $138 million. Lamb Weston posted a strong double-digit rate of profit growth, driven by favorable volumes and product mix as well as improved operating conditions; the profit growth for Lamb Weston was partially offset by profit declines in the milling operations resulting from less favorable market conditions.
The company expects this segment to post good profit growth in fiscal 2013 due to continued momentum in Lamb Weston potato operations and improved performance in the flour milling operations.
Hedging Activities 
This language primarily relates to operations other than the company's milling operations.
The company recorded $53 million of net hedging loss within unallocated Corporate expense in the current quarter and $7 million of net hedging benefit as unallocated Corporate expense in the year-ago period. The company identifies these amounts as items impacting comparability. Those amounts are reclassified from unallocated Corporate expense to the operating segments when the underlying commodity or foreign currency being hedged is expensed in segment cost of goods sold (COGS).

Changes in Accounting for Pensions
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, ConAgra Foods changed its methods of accounting for pensions for the purpose of providing better transparency to the core business performance. These changes do not affect benefits for pension plan participants. While ConAgra Foods' previous accounting methodologies were in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the new methods are considered preferable. These accounting changes apply to historical periods as well as future periods. ConAgra Foods' pension accounting changes impact three main areas:
 
 
 
CONAGRA FOODS
page 7
 
These impact unallocated Corporate expense and change historical EPS amounts. Items 2 and 3 above change the comparable EPS base for current and prior periods (this added $0.02 to reported and comparable EPS in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, and added $0.08 to reported and comparable EPS for the full year fiscal 2012, as discussed below). Historical segment results (Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments) are not impacted by these pension accounting changes. This change does not impact cash flow or pension funding requirements. Details on these changes, answers to anticipated questions, and tables showing revised historical amounts are contained in the written question-and-answer document associated with this release.
Fiscal 2013 Outlook
In fiscal 2013, the company expects 6-8% growth over the comparable EPS base of $1.84* in fiscal 2012, adjusted for items impacting comparability. This outlook reflects a continuation of challenging industry conditions, but overall EPS growth primarily due to the benefit of: 1) contributions from businesses acquired in fiscal 2012 (estimated at roughly half of fiscal 2013's comparable EPS growth); 2) continued growth in its Lamb Weston potato operations (Commercial Foods); and 3) successful margin management and moderating inflation in the Consumer Foods segment. The company currently expects Consumer Foods COGS to incur a mid-single digit rate of inflation, and for Consumer Foods COGS-related cost savings to approximate $240 million, in fiscal 2013.

Q4 FY12 Question & Answer
June 21, 2012
 
 
Sales for were in line with year-ago amounts.
Ro*Tel
 
 
 
Consumer Foods organic volume decreased 5%.
Commercial Foods volume increased 3%.
 
Approximately $95 million (versus approximately $97 million in Q4 FY11)
 
Approximately $372 million (versus approximately $361 million in FY11)
 
Approximately $98 million (versus approximately $119 million in Q4 FY11)
 
Approximately $337 million (versus approximately $466 million in FY11)
 
Approximately $51 million (versus approximately $55 million in Q4 FY11)
 
Approximately $204 million (versus approximately $178 million in FY11). The increase is due primarily to a former debtor's repayment in full of the payment-in-kind notes receivable in FY11 (related to the divestiture of the Trading & Merchandising operations), and thus the company no longer receives interest income from those notes.
 
Corporate expense was $513 million for the quarter and $64 million in the year-ago period. Current-quarter amounts include $449 million of net expense from items impacting comparability, the most significant of which are $397 million related to pension accounting changes and $53 million related to hedge loss. Prior-year-ago amounts include $3 million of net expense from items impacting comparability (revised due to pension accounting changes). After adjusting for items impacting comparability, current-quarter expense was $64 million compared with $61 million in the year-ago period.
 
Approximately $100 million (versus approximately $98 million in Q4 FY11), reflecting an increase in the dividend rate earlier this fiscal year, which was partially offset by the impact of fewer shares outstanding.
 
Approximately $389 million
 
Approximately 412 million shares for the quarter; approximately 418 million shares for the full fiscal year
 
The company repurchased approximately $250 million, or approximately 9.5 million shares, of its common stock during the quarter. The company has approximately $525 million remaining on its existing share repurchase authorization.
 
Gross margin = segment gross profit* divided by net sales
Gross margin = $761/$3,414 = 22%
Operating margin = segment operating profit** divided by net sales
Operating margin = $408/$3,414 = 12%
 
 
 
 
 
38% currently and 33% a year ago
This ratio is defined as net debt divided by the sum of net debt plus shareholders' equity. See question No. #16 for the components of net debt.
 
After adjusting for items impacting comparability, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year was in line with the company's expectations.
 
The company expects the tax rate to be in the range of 34%, excluding items impacting comparability. The company acknowledges that the quarterly rates may be different from this, given the timing of certain matters, but that the overall rate is expected to approximate 34%.
 
Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 are expected to be approximately $450 million.
 
Net interest expense for fiscal 2013 is expected to be approximately $200 million.
 
PENSION
The following information highlights the major changes in pension accounting that ConAgra Foods has implemented. For a more complete discussion of our change in pension accounting, please refer to our Form 10-K to be filed in July 2012.
Context:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is important to note that ConAgra Foods is confident that its pensions are adequately funded to handle future needs. ConAgra Foods contributes to its plans periodically, ensuring that the asset balances are adequate and appropriate. As an example, in fiscal 2012, ConAgra Foods contributed approximately $326 million to its plans. As of fiscal 2012 year end, our funding levels were approximately 83%.
Change in Pension Accounting
 
 
 
Questions Relating to the Pension Accounting change
 
Our primary objective was to provide better transparency to our core business performance by eliminating the impact of pension amortization from our income statement for all periods presented.
 
There are three components:
 
 
 
 
Over the past couple of years, with the significant drop in interest rates and the resulting increase in pension liabilities, we have experienced significant amortization expense related to our pension actuarial losses. We also expected the fiscal 2013 income statement to be significantly impacted by the amortization of these losses. Given the continued volatility in the financial markets and our desire to provide better transparency to our core business performance, we concluded we should proceed with the change now. Note that the amortization of actuarial losses under the old accounting method does not represent economic losses that occur in that period; those losses were essentially the result of changes in interest rates and changes in pension assets and liabilities, and the resulting impact of those changes on net pension expense. Therefore, the amortization tends to distort the current period financial performance.
 
While both methods are acceptable under GAAP, we and our advisors believe the new method is preferable.
 
No. It is important to recognize that such gains and losses will only be recognized in years when accumulated gains and losses exceed the 10% threshold.
 
To the extent interest rates and/or asset values rise, there would be significant reductions in pension expense under the old method. However, our primary objective is to eliminate these volatile pension accounting impacts from our earnings and provide more transparency to our core business performance.
 
The accounting change has no impact on our funding level or funding requirements. As we said before, we are very comfortable with our funding level and believe we compare favorably to our peers and other comparable pension plan sponsors.
 
The accounting change would have no material impact on our credit metrics, balance sheet strength or liquidity position. The charges in fiscal 2012 and 2011, which we treat as items impacting comparability, do not impact our assets or liabilities. Effectively, we are moving losses deferred in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders' equity into retained earnings. The net effect each of assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity balances is zero.
Reflecting these accounting changes, ConAgra Foods' FY11 and FY12 EPS details are summarized below:
