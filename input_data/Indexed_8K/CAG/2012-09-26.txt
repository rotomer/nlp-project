Item 8.01 Other Events.
On September 25, 2012, Gary Rodkin, Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods, Inc. (the "Company"), established a pre-arranged stock trading plan with a broker to exercise expiring options and, as part of the process of exercising the expiring options, sell shares of the Companys common stock. Mr. Rodkin is required to meet a stock ownership guideline of six times his base salary. He currently significantly exceeds, and after the exercise and sale expects to continue to significantly exceed, that ownership guideline. Mr. Rodkin does not expect the operation of the plan to materially change his beneficial ownership stake in the Company. Mr. Rodkins plan is being established in accordance with the guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Rule 10b5-1 permits directors and officers to adopt a pre-arranged stock trading plan at a time when they do not possess material non-public information. The plan instructs a third party broker to buy or sell a specified number of shares of Company stock at a future time. In accordance with internal Company policy, no trades may be executed under the terms of the plan for 30 days. Transactions made under a Rule 10b5-1 Plan will be disclosed publicly in accordance with the requirements of Form 144 and Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This Form 8-K is being filed for informational purposes only. Pursuant to internal Company policy, insiders are permitted to enter into Rule 10b5-1 pre-planned stock trading plans and the Company does not undertake to report on specific plans of Company insiders, nor to report modification or terminations of the aforementioned 10b5-1 Plan or the plan of any other individual.
