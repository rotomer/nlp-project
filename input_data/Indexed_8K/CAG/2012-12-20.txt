Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On December 20, 2012, ConAgra Foods, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release and posted a question and answer document ("Q&A") on its website containing information on the Company's second quarter fiscal 2013 financial results. The press release and Q&A are furnished with this Form 8-K as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively.
The press release and Q&A include the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted operating profit for the Consumer Foods segment, adjusted unallocated corporate expense, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, effective tax rate excluding items impacting comparability and net debt. Management considers GAAP financial measures as well as such non-GAAP financial information in its evaluation of the Company's financial statements and believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information to assess the Company's operating performance and financial position. To the extent required, these measures are reconciled in the press release and Q&A to the most directly comparable measures as reported in accordance with GAAP, and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Company's diluted earnings per share, operating performance and financial measures as calculated in accordance with GAAP.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Fiscal 2013 Second-quarter Highlights (% cited vs. year-ago period amounts, where applicable):
 
 
 
 
 
 
OMAHA, Neb., Dec. 20, 2012  ConAgra Foods, Inc., (NYSE: CAG) one of North America's leading packaged food companies, today reported results for the fiscal 2013 second quarter ended Nov. 25, 2012. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.51 in the fiscal second quarter, up

19% over $0.43 earned in the year-ago period. Excluding $0.06 of net expense in both the current quarter and the year-ago period from items impacting comparability, current quarter EPS of $0.57 was 16% above the comparable $0.49 earned in the year-ago period. Items impacting comparability in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 and the same period a year ago are summarized toward the end of this release and reconciled for Regulation G purposes starting on page 9.
Gary Rodkin, ConAgra Foods' chief executive officer, said, "We are pleased that both of our segments posted operating profit growth in the midst of current economic conditions. Effective margin management initiatives, moderating input cost inflation, the benefit of acquisitions, and good results from our potato operations are collectively driving high-quality EPS growth. We are very excited about the pending acquisition of Ralcorp, which we announced on Nov. 27, 2012, given the strategically and financially compelling nature of the acquisition. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of calendar 2013, and we look forward to updating our investors on the financial benefits of the acquisition in due course."
The Consumer Foods segment posted sales of $2,423 million and operating profit of $286 million for the second quarter.Sales increased 11%, reflecting 11% contribution from acquisitions, 4% favorable price/mix, and a 4% organic volume decline. Sequentially, organic volume improved by a slight amount (on an unrounded basis).

Operating profit of $286 million grew 12% over $256 million in the year-ago period, as reported. After adjusting for $7 million of net expense in the current period, and $15 million of net expense in the year-ago period, from items impacting comparability, current-quarter operating profit of $293 million increased 8% over the comparable $271 million a year ago. Marketing investment for the base business (excluding recently completed acquisitions) increased 18%, reflecting the company's planned commitment to building long-term brand strength. Operating profit growth was driven by a combination of favorable price/mix and other margin management initiatives, moderating inflation, and contribution from completed acquisitions.
The company currently expects full fiscal year productivity savings to exceed $250 million for this segment and for input cost inflation to be approximately 2-3%.
Sales for the Commercial Foods segment were $1,312 million, 5% above year-ago period amounts. The growth primarily reflects favorable price/mix and good volumes for the Lamb Weston potato operations, which posted notable success in international markets. To a lesser extent, the sales growth also reflects the pass-through of higher wheat costs in terms of higher flour prices for the milling operations. The overall segment remains focused on top-line growth through innovation, improving product mix with higher-margin items, and strong alignment with high-potential customers.
Segment operating profit was $169 million, 5% above year-ago period amounts as reported, reflecting the sales growth as well as a continued focus on productivity and cost-saving initiatives. Lamb Weston drove the overall segment's profit growth, while flour milling profits were below year-ago period amounts, as planned, due to the very strong performance in the same period a year ago.

Hedging Activities 
This language primarily relates to operations other than the company's milling operations.
The company recorded $16 million of net hedging loss in the current quarter, and $27 million of net hedging loss in the year-ago period, as unallocated Corporate expense. The company identifies these amounts as items impacting comparability. Hedge gains and losses are aggregated, and net amounts are reclassified from unallocated Corporate expense to the operating segments when the underlying commodity or foreign currency being hedged is expensed in segment cost of goods sold.

Fiscal 2013 EPS Outlook
Based on the strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year, the company now expects fiscal 2013 diluted EPS to be at least $2.06, adjusted for items impacting comparability; this is an increase from previous expectations of $2.03  $2.06 on that same basis. This guidance excludes any fiscal 2013 EPS benefit related to the Ralcorp acquisition, which will be quantified in due course after the transaction closes.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Q2 FY13 Question & Answer
December 20, 2012
 
 
 
 
 
Consumer Foods organic volume declined 4%.
Commercial Foods volume was flat.
 
There has been a change in methodology regarding the presentation of certain types of product sales. Previously, the margin from these sales was included as a reduction of cost of goods sold, and now it is reported on a gross basis as sales and cost of goods sold. This has no impact on profitability.
 
Approximately $94 million (versus approximately $95 million in Q2 FY12)
 
Approximately $82 million (versus approximately $65 million in Q2 FY12)
 
Approximately $53 million (versus approximately $51 million in Q2 FY12)
 
Unallocated Corporate expense was $89 million in the current quarter and $102 million in the year-ago period, as reported. Current-quarter amounts include $16 million of net hedge loss, and $10 million of expense from acquisition and restructuring charges, while year-ago amounts include $27 million of hedge losses. Excluding these amounts, unallocated Corporate expense was $63 million for the current quarter (rounded) and $75 million in the year-ago period.
 
Approximately $97 million (versus approximately $95 million in Q2 FY12), reflecting a higher dividend rate partially offset by fewer shares outstanding.
 
Approximately 412 million shares for the quarter
 
The company repurchased approximately 6.1 million of its shares of common stock during the quarter for approximately $170 million. As previously communicated, the company expects to substantially reduce its share repurchase activities in the near term given the plans to acquire Ralcorp. A slowdown in share repurchases is reflected in the company's full year fiscal 2013 EPS outlook.
 
Gross margin = segment gross profit* divided by net sales
Gross margin = $879/$3,736 = 24%
Operating margin = segment operating profit** divided by net sales
Operating margin = $455/$3,736 = 12%
 
 
 
 
 
40% currently and 32% a year ago
This ratio is defined as net debt divided by the sum of net debt plus shareholders' equity. See question No. #13 for the components of net debt.
 
The company expects the tax rate for its existing operations to be approximately 34%, excluding items impacting comparability.
 
Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 for existing operations are expected to be approximately $500 million.
 
Net interest expense for fiscal 2013 for existing operations is expected to be approximately $215 million.
