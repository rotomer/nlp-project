Exhibit 99.01 [CARDINAL HEALTH LOGO] 7000 Cardinal Place Dublin, OH 43017 www.cardinal.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACTS: Media: Jim Mazzola Investors: Steve Fischbach (614) 757-3690 (614) 757-7067 jim.mazzola@cardinal.com stephen.fischbach@cardinal.com CARDINAL HEALTH FIRST QUARTER REVENUE UP 16 PERCENT TARGETED ANNUAL CASH FLOW AND EPS GROWTH ON TRACK FOR FISCAL 2004 DUBLIN, OHIO, OCT. 23, 2003 -- Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE: CAH), the leading provider of products and services supporting the health care industry, today announced record first quarter business results marked by a double-digit revenue increase, continued improvement in productivity and progress against its strategy to expand healthcare products and services along the chain of care. For the period ending Sept. 30, 2003, as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), revenue rose 16 percent to $13.3 billion from $11.4 billion a year ago and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 16 percent to $0.74. GAAP operating earnings grew 12 percent to $522 million, with more than 60 percent contributed by businesses outside the company's core pharmaceutical distribution activities. "Performance for the quarter reflects Cardinal Health's diversified leadership positions in a strong healthcare market," said Robert D. Walter, chairman and chief executive officer, Cardinal Health. "Our medical products, pharmaceutical technologies and automation businesses delivered solid earnings results, with excellent momentum going into the remainder of the year. Pharmaceutical distribution delivered exceptional revenue growth, while earnings growth was affected by a challenging vendor margin environment. With strong momentum from our other key lines of business and expected second half improvement in pharmaceutical distribution results, Cardinal Health continues to target earnings per share growth of mid teens or better for fiscal 2004." Cardinal Health generated an increase of more than $300 million in operating cash flow during the quarter and expects to generate approximately $1.3 billion in operating cash flow for the year. In addition, the company completed a $1 billion stock buy back program that represented the repurchase of over 17 million shares. -more-
CARDINAL HEALTH FIRST QUARTER REVENUE UP 16 PERCENT PAGE 2 "We continue to invest for the long term, with more than $26 million of investment spending charges against current earnings during the quarter," Walter added. "Strategic investments are a critical component of our growth strategy, and we see significant opportunity to continue to build scale, including through expansion in markets outside the United States that currently represent less than 10 percent of Cardinal Health's business." FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Cardinal Health incurred special items during the quarter consisting of merger-related costs and restructuring charges, partially offset by cash received from a litigation settlement. These items totaled $13.2 million ($8.7 million after tax) in the first quarter, compared to $18.7 million ($15.6 million after tax) in the same period last year, and decreased earnings per diluted share in the current quarter and comparable quarter by $0.02 and $0.03, respectively. The following discussion adjusts certain amounts to exclude special items incurred during the quarter. Please see the attached financial table for a reconciliation of the reported amounts to the amounts excluding these items. o EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE from continuing operations rose 13 percent to $0.76 versus $0.67 last year. Net earnings from continuing operations rose 12 percent to $339 million from $304 million a year ago. o OPERATING REVENUES rose 16 percent to a first quarter record $13.3 billion, from $11.4 billion a year ago. o OPERATING EARNINGS rose 10 percent to $536 million from $486 million a year ago. o INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER declined by 8 percent, driven by strong cash flow and lower interest rates. o RETURN ON EQUITY was 18.2 percent compared to 19.0 percent last year and RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL improved to 7.21 percent versus 7.08 percent a year ago. o OPERATING CASH FLOW of $294 million in the quarter was strong as a result of effective working capital management and lower inventory investments in the pharmaceutical distribution business. Owned inventories declined by more than $200 million in the quarter. Accounts receivable days improved to 18 days versus 19 days a year ago. o THE RATIO OF NET DEBT-TO-TOTAL CAPITAL was 20 percent, and the company ended the quarter with $992 million cash on hand. -more-
CARDINAL HEALTH FIRST QUARTER REVENUE UP 16 PERCENT PAGE 3 SIGNIFICANT EVENTS FOR THE QUARTER AND BUSINESS RESULTS During the quarter Cardinal Health made significant progress executing against key strategies to build scale and drive competitive advantage; to expand product and service offerings that deepen customer relationships; and to innovate and invest in technology and services to provide integrated solutions and new levels of customer value. Highlights include: o The acquisition of Gala Biotech as part of an ongoing strategy to enhance Cardinal Health's range of innovative drug development services that help customers bring biopharmaceuticals to market at lower costs. o Rapid customer acceptance of Pyxis PatientStation(R), with signed agreements representing more than 5,000 units. These systems deliver significant value to hospitals by bringing medication and supply storage, entertainment and clinical information to the patient's bedside. o The announcement of a contract to produce Roche's Klonopin(R), a leading medication for panic disorder, in Cardinal Health's patented Zydis(R) quick dissolve form. o Strong market acceptance of new self-manufactured medical products. New product momentum continued with last week's clearance by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market Esteem(R) surgical gloves with a proprietary emollient designed to help protect surgeons' hands. o Healthcare provider demand for integrated solutions continues strong, now representing more than $5 billion in annual sales and growing 19 percent year-on-year, an indicator of the increased value Cardinal Health is bringing its customers through integrated offerings. Specific segment results included: -more-
CARDINAL HEALTH FIRST QUARTER REVENUE UP 16 PERCENT PAGE 4 PHARMACEUTICAL DISTRIBUTION AND PROVIDER SERVICES delivered 16 percent revenue growth, increasing to $10.8 billion, compared to $9.3 billion during the first quarter of fiscal year 2003. Results from the company's provider services businesses continued strong across the board. Robust sales from all pharmaceutical distribution customer segments were partially offset by a significant decline in wholesale-to-wholesale trading company revenues. The company experienced lower vendor margins because of limited product availability. These lower vendor margins as well as continued selling margin pressure were partially offset by expense control, driving operating earnings of $266 million. Return on sales was 2.45 percent, down 36 basis points, while return on invested capital continued strong primarily reflecting lower inventory levels. For the full year, the company expects to see continued improvements in productivity and returns on capital for this segment. Near term pressure on vendor margins and selling margins for pharmaceutical distribution is expected to improve in the second half of the year. MEDICAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES revenue increased 9 percent to $1.7 billion with operating earnings of $150 million led by momentum in distribution activities. Earnings growth was driven by increased sales of self-manufactured offerings, such as Esteem(R) surgical gloves, and new respiratory and thermal products. Revenue generated from new products tripled during the quarter. Key customer growth segments included ambulatory care and surgery centers, which increased 20 percent in the quarter. The company continues to expect revenue growth substantially above industry levels, with rising returns on sales reflecting new distribution contracts, increased sales of higher margin self-manufactured products and continued success of new products. PHARMACEUTICAL TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES showed continued strength with a year-over-year revenue increase of 57 percent to $606 million. Solid growth from drug delivery and manufacturing drove high-teens organic earnings growth, and the addition of Syncor nuclear pharmacy results contributed to segment earnings growth of 47 percent. Revenue gains were particularly strong in oral drug manufacturing, which experienced gains from Lilly's Zyprexa(R) Zydis(R) for schizophrenia, and Mylan's Amnesteem(R), a dermatology product. Packaging services also experienced strong gains driven by the launch of Astra Zeneca's Crestor(R), a cholesterol medication. Increased capacity utilization, integration efficiencies from nuclear pharmacy operations and tight expense control contributed to the 47 percent improvement in operating earnings. Cardinal Health continues to expect Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services to represent its fastest growing segment, with results substantially above industry growth rates. Expected approval of new products, coupled with the launch of sterile manufacturing capacity awaiting FDA approval is expected to drive momentum in revenue and operating earnings growth throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. -more-
CARDINAL HEALTH FIRST QUARTER REVENUE UP 16 PERCENT PAGE 5 AUTOMATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES revenues increased 7 percent to $143 million. Manufacturing efficiencies and expense control yielded an increase in return on sales of 266 basis points and drove an operating earnings increase of 15 percent. Installations and associated revenues were dampened by business disruptions experienced by healthcare providers during the quarter. The backlog of committed contracts ended the quarter at $208 million. Based on strong demand, the company expects significant revenue growth for the remainder of the year as delayed installations are booked and new contracts are signed and installed. Ongoing expense control and the benefit of just-in-time manufacturing are expected to continue to drive productivity improvement. The company expects this segment to grow at historically strong levels, led by growing customer demand for Pyxis PatientStation.

Exhibit 99.02 The Company incurred special items during the quarter, consisting primarily of restructuring and merger related costs, partially offset by income received in conjunction with settlement of litigation arising from antitrust claims against certain vitamin manufacturers for amounts overcharged in prior years ("vitamin litigation"). Merger charges include such items as costs associated with exit and consolidation of facilities as well as cost of integrating acquired businesses. Restructuring charges primarily relate to decisions made by management to incur costs to realign components of its business operations to meet current business demands. On a net basis, these special items totaled $13.2 million ($8.7 million after tax) versus $18.7 million ($15.6 million after tax) for the year-earlier period. In the opinion of management, these items, by their nature, rarely have predictable trends and are not truly reflective of ongoing operating results. Therefore, the Company presents its results on both a GAAP basis (GAAP) and a GAAP basis excluding these items ("adjusted"). Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the "adjusted" numbers as a supplemental metric to assist readers. It should be noted that the items being adjusted from the GAAP results represent actual income or expense to the Company. These items impact operating cash flow available to support on-going operations. As such, these items are an important component of the financial performance of the Company and any metric excluding them will present an incomplete picture. Nevertheless, management uses "adjusted" results to measure its performance, in addition to the GAAP results. As the Company's core business is providing health care products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use a metric that is free of charges and gains associated with restructuring, merger related activity and litigation. While these may be recurring items for the Company, management believes they are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and are related more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions that tend to mask the trends and financial performance of the Company's products and services. Management also believes that investors may also find an unmasked view of the Company's core operations to be useful.
