(NYSE: CAH), the leading provider of products and services supporting the health care industry announced today. For the quarter ended March 31, 2004, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), revenue rose 14 percent to $14.6 billion, operating earnings increased 9 percent to $665 million and earnings from continuing operations were up 11 percent to $429 million. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations improved 15 percent to $0.98. Year-to-date revenues now exceed $42 billion, with operating earnings and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations reaching $1.8 billion and $2.58, respectively. With strong operating cash flow of $787 million during the quarter, the company expects to exceed its operating cash flow target of $1.3 billion for the full fiscal year ending June 30. "Our results this quarter once again demonstrate the power of our diverse portfolio of market-leading products and services and the tremendous growth opportunities within the healthcare industry," said Robert D. Walter, chairman and chief executive officer of Cardinal Health. "The success of our strategy to achieve scale and integrate our offerings is once again reflected in this quarter's results. In addition, continued exceptional cash flow allows us to fund this strategy for the future and fuel long-term growth." BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC HIGHLIGHTS Cardinal Health made progress during the quarter against strategies to build scale and drive competitive advantage in the health care industry, expand product and service offerings, and make investments to deliver new levels of customer value through integrated solutions. Highlights for the quarter include: -- more --
CARDINAL HEALTH DELIVERS RECORD THIRD QUARTER RESULTS PAGE 2 - Double-digit revenue and operating earnings growth in the Medical Products and Services segment from strong distribution sales of more than 300,000 medical products and a continued focus on productivity and expense control. Growth in the segment continues to increase faster than the industry rate. - Positive momentum in pharmaceutical distribution, led by strong customer demand, expense productivity and a disciplined approach to pricing. Productive negotiations with pharmaceutical manufacturers continued during the period regarding Cardinal Health's transition to fee-for-service Distribution Service Agreements (DSA). - Excellent growth in Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services, led by nuclear pharmacy and packaging services. Solid revenue and earnings contributions were also delivered by recently-acquired Intercare, plc., which is rapidly being integrated into Cardinal Health. - Exceptional asset management, including a seven-day decline in days inventory on hand, which lowered from 58 days to 51 days. Receivable days also lowered, both contributing to strong operating cash flow for the quarter. - Repurchase of 6.9 million Cardinal Health shares, nearly completing the $500 million repurchase authorization announced on Feb 27. - Six new corporate agreements signed during the quarter, bringing the total number of agreements, which represent products and services from multiple Cardinal Health segments, to nearly 200. These integrated offerings now represent well over $6 billion in annual sales and are growing more than 23 percent annually. "By continuing to fully leverage the breadth of our healthcare offerings, we are in an excellent position to deliver unmatched value to customers," said George L. Fotiades, president and chief operating officer of Cardinal Health. "Every segment is benefiting from an increased focus on integrating and cross-selling our products and services, with growth rates from corporate agreements substantially higher than base growth rates for most segments." FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Special items during the quarter totaled $8 million, primarily related to the integration of recently acquired businesses. The following discussion adjusts certain amounts to exclude special items incurred during the quarter. Please see the attached financial table for a reconciliation of the reported amounts to the amounts excluding these items. - EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE from continuing operations rose 15 percent to $0.99 versus $0.86 last year. Earnings from continuing operations rose 11 percent to $434 million from $391 million a year ago. - OPERATING EARNINGS rose 9 percent to $673 million from $618 million a year ago. Strong earnings growth contributions were made by the company's Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services, and Medical Products and Services segments. - INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER declined by 9 percent, driven by lower interest rates and strong cash flow. - TAX RATE decreased 60 basis points primarily due to a higher mix of international business during the quarter. -- more --
CARDINAL HEALTH DELIVERS RECORD THIRD QUARTER RESULTS PAGE 3 - RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL improved 35 basis points to 9.06 percent, reflecting excellent capital productivity and strong asset management. RETURN ON EQUITY was 22.8 percent compared to 22.7 percent last year. - OPERATING CASH FLOW of $787 million in the quarter was the result of strong earnings combined with focused asset management. Year-to-date cash flow rose to more than $1.3 billion. - THE RATIO OF NET DEBT-TO-TOTAL CAPITAL was 21 percent, and the company ended the quarter with $527 million cash on hand. SEGMENT RESULTS Segment results reflect the strength of Cardinal Health's diversified business, comprised of market-leading products and services. Growth for the quarter was led by Medical Products and Services, and Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services, but all segments delivered strong cash flow and an improvement in return on invested capital. Specific segment results are included in the table below, followed by a performance summary for each business. THIRD QUARTER - SEGMENT RESULTS ------------------------------- (1) Results for Intercare, acquired in December 2003, includes a parallel import business that is similar to Cardinal Health's pharmaceutical distribution business. For segment reporting purposes, this business is included in the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment (Revenues of $87 million and operating earnings of $2.6 million for the third quarter). PHARMACEUTICAL DISTRIBUTION AND PROVIDER SERVICES delivered strong overall revenue growth of 14 percent to $11.9 billion. Within pharmaceutical distribution, all customer segments experienced solid growth, with sales to health systems increasing 17 percent as the company continued to leverage integrated selling efforts as part of corporate agreements. Direct Store Door (DSD) sales - buying full cases, breaking them down into customized orders and distributing to customers -- rose 24 percent. DSD sales best represent underlying customer demand within Cardinal Health's core distribution business. Operating earnings improved sequentially to $344 million. Excellent asset management resulted in strong cash flow and return on capital. Key customer agreements signed during the quarter included an exclusive, multi-year contract renewal with Express Scripts, Inc. -- more --
CARDINAL HEALTH DELIVERS RECORD THIRD QUARTER RESULTS PAGE 4 MEDICAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES posted very strong, record revenue, which increased 14 percent to $1.9 billion, and operating earnings, which increased 11 percent to $182 million. Revenue growth was all organic, driven by momentum in medical products distribution and new self-manufactured products, primarily surgeon gloves. The company acquired Snowden Pencer, Inc. during the quarter, a manufacturer of specialty surgical instruments, to extend its market-leading position with complementary products. The margin impact of pricing pressure, increases in raw material costs and a higher mix of distribution sales were substantially offset by productivity improvements and disciplined expense control. After-tax earnings outside the U.S. increased sharply as a result of streamlined international operations and focus on key geographies. PHARMACEUTICAL TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES performance was highlighted by double-digit operating earnings growth in packaging and nuclear pharmacy services. Revenue increased 14 percent to $678 million and operating earnings increased 22 percent to $115 million. Favorable product mix and productivity gains drove a 116 basis point improvement in return on sales. Operational highlights include the start of manufacturing validation processes at new sterile facilities in Brussels, Belgium and Raleigh, N.C. The sales and operating earnings benefit from the recent acquisition of Intercare, plc. was partially offset by a delay in the sterile manufacturing approval for a key product. That product is now approved for launch by the Food and Drug Administration. AUTOMATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES revenue grew 4 percent to $172 million as hospitals continue to face capital spending pressures. Over the long term, significant new product introductions and an ongoing focus on medication safety initiatives within hospitals are expected to further extend market-leading positions in this segment. In addition, renewal rates for existing contracts continue to exceed 98 percent. Favorable product mix during the quarter, including solid sales of Cardinal Health's flagship Pyxis MedStation(R) product, and installation productivity led to an increase in return on sales of 162 basis points with operating earnings rising 8 percent to $69 million. Other highlights included an endorsement from the American Hospital Association for Cardinal Health's Pyxis PatientStation(R) as the leading bedside technology platform for patient education and clinical applications, and receiving the ISO 9001:2000 quality certification from the International Standards Organization. Committed contracts grew 8 percent year-on-year and the backlog of committed contracts ended the quarter at $186 million. OUTLOOK Cardinal Health reiterated its long-term financial goals and expectation to achieve targets set for the current fiscal year. The following table summarizes long-term financial goals and outlook for the current fiscal year. -- more --

Exhibit 99.02 The Company incurred special items during the quarter, consisting primarily of merger and restructuring costs, partially offset by income received in conjunction with settlement of litigation arising from antitrust claims against certain vitamin manufacturers for amounts overcharged in prior years. Merger charges include such items as costs associated with exit and consolidation of facilities as well as costs of integrating acquired businesses. Restructuring charges primarily relate to decisions made by management to incur costs to realign components of its business operations to meet current business demands. On a net basis, these special items totaled $8.3 million ($4.9 million after tax) versus $9.8 million ($6.4 million after tax) for the year-earlier period. In the opinion of management, these items, by their nature, rarely have predictable trends and are not truly reflective of ongoing operating results. Therefore, the Company presents its results on both a GAAP basis (GAAP) and a GAAP basis excluding these items ("adjusted"). Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the "adjusted" numbers as a supplemental metric to assist readers. It should be noted that the items being adjusted from the GAAP results represent actual income or expense to the Company. These items impact operating cash flow available to support on-going operations. As such, these items are an important component of the financial performance of the Company and any metric excluding them will present an incomplete picture. Nevertheless, management uses "adjusted" results to measure its performance, in addition to the GAAP results. As the Company's core business is providing health care products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use a metric that is free of charges and gains associated with restructuring, merger related activity and litigation. While these may be recurring items for the Company, management believes they are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and are related more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions that tend to mask the trends and financial performance of the Company's products and services. Management also believes that investors may also find an unmasked view of the Company's core operations to be useful.
