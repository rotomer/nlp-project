(NYSE: CAH) provided the following chronology and supplemental information in connection with the previously announced SEC investigation and audit committee review of certain accounting matters: - - On October 7, 2003, the Company received a request from the SEC, in connection with an informal inquiry, for historical financial and related information including but not limited to the accounting treatment of the recovery from vitamin manufacturers. The SEC's request sought a variety of documentation, including the Company's accounting records for fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2003, as well as notes, memoranda, presentations, e-mail and other correspondence, budgets, forecasts and estimates. - - Since October 2003, the Company has been collecting and providing to the SEC documents responsive to the October request. Due to the scope of the October request and the breadth of the Company's operations, the Company is cooperating with the SEC to provide documents to the SEC on a rolling basis, and that process is ongoing. - - In April 2004, the Company's audit committee determined to undertake an internal review and retained independent counsel. This review: - was prompted by documents contained in the production to the SEC that raised issues as to certain accounting matters, including but not limited to the establishment and adjustment of certain reserves and their impact on quarterly earnings, and is not limited to the accounting treatment of the recovery from vitamin manufacturers; and - is ongoing and has not reached any conclusions. - - As disclosed in the Company's Form 10-Q, if the audit committee review determines that any changes are required to the Company's disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls, the Company will make any necessary modifications. - - On May 6, 2004, the Company was notified that the pending SEC inquiry had been converted to a formal investigation. The SEC investigation is not limited to the accounting treatment of the recovery from vitamin manufacturers. - - The Company intends to continue to respond to the SEC's ongoing investigation and provide all information required by the SEC.
