ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS As previously disclosed, there are changes underway in Cardinal Health's pharmaceutical distribution business that involve a move from inflation based compensation to a business model where pharmaceutical distributors are compensated on a fee-for-service basis. The Company has previously stated that its objective is to convert the majority of its pharmaceutical distribution volume to fee-for-service based compensation by June 30, 2005. In connection with the conversion to the new business model, Cardinal Health has sent letters to pharmaceutical manufacturers representing a substantial majority of its pharmaceutical distribution volume, which letters outlined a new Company policy. This new policy provides that the Company's business arrangements with manufacturers will call for compensation based on fair market value pricing reflecting the logistical, capital and administrative characteristics of their individual product lines. The compensation will be measurable and will not be contingent on inflation, but only on Cardinal Health's satisfactory delivery of distribution services to the manufacturers. This policy will have an effective date of April 1, 2005 (or the next anniversary date of the Company's current agreement with the individual manufacturer, depending on circumstances). Based on the current sequencing schedule, the Company currently expects that it will be able to enter into acceptable agreements with these manufacturers before the April 1st, 2005 effective date. However, in situations where the Company and the manufacturer are unable to reach a mutually acceptable agreement, Cardinal Health has informed the manufacturer that it will assist them in transitioning to another method of distribution for its products. SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
