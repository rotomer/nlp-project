Unless the Administrative Agent determines that any applicable condition specified in Article IV has not been satisfied, the Administrative Agent will make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the relevant Borrower at the Administrative Agent's aforesaid address. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.10, to the extent that a Loan made by a Lender matures on the Borrowing Date of a requested Loan, such Lender shall apply the proceeds of the Loan it is then making to the repayment of principal of the maturing Loan. 2.11 Changes in Interest Rate, etc. Each Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance is made or is converted from a Eurodollar Advance into a Floating Rate Advance pursuant to Section 2.9 to but excluding the date it becomes due or is converted into a Eurodollar Advance pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate for such day. Changes in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained as a Floating Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at the interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent as applicable to such Eurodollar Advance based upon the Borrower's selections under Sections 2.8 and 2.9 and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 2.8 or 2.9, during the continuance of a Default or Unmatured Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrowers (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that no Advance may be made as, converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Advance. During the continuance of a Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrowers (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.2 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that (i) each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus 2% per annum and (ii) each Floating Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate in effect from time to time plus 2% per annum, provided that, during the continuance of a Default under Section 7.6 or 7.7, the interest rates set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be applicable to all Advances without any election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender. 2.13 Method of Payment. All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds by wire transfer to the Administrative Agent at (except as set forth in the next sentence) the Administrative Agent's address specified pursuant to Article XIII, or at any other Lending Installation of the Administrative Agent specified in writing by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, by noon (local time) on the date when due and shall be applied ratably by the Administrative Agent among the Lenders. Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Administrative Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that the Administrative Agent received at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the Administrative Agent from such Lender. 2.14 Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness. (i) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. (ii) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it will record (a) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and, if applicable, the Interest Period with respect thereto, (b) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (c) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrowers and each Lender's share thereof. 15
(iii) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms. (iv) Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by a promissory note (a "Note"). In such event, the relevant Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender in a form supplied by the Administrative Agent and reasonably acceptable to the Company. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after any assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be represented by a Note payable to the order of the payee named therein or any assignee pursuant to Section 12.3, except to the extent that any such Lender or assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above. 2.15 Telephonic Notices. The Borrowers hereby authorize the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of Types of Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices given to the Administrative Agent by any person or persons listed on Schedule 8, as such Schedule may be revised by the Company from time to time in accordance with Section 13.1, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices and Conversion/Continuation Notices to be given telephonically. The Borrowers agree to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent regarding the telephonic notice shall govern absent manifest error. 2.16 Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Interest accrued on each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such date to occur after the date hereof, on any date on which the Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest on Floating Rate Loans shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year, as appropriate. Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding principal amount of any Floating Rate Advance converted into a Eurodollar Advance on a day other than a Payment Date shall be payable on the date of conversion. Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable in arrears on the last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period longer than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month interval during such Interest Period. Facility fees, utilization fees and interest on Eurodollar Advances shall be 16
calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest shall be payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount paid if payment is received prior to noon (local time) at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing interest in connection with such payment. 2.17 Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment Reductions. Promptly after receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder. The Administrative Agent will notify each Lender, the Company and the relevant Borrower of the interest rate applicable to each Eurodollar Advance promptly upon determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender and the Company prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate. 2.18 Lending Installations. Each Lender will book its Loans at the appropriate Lending Installation listed on Schedule 4 or such other Lending Installation designated by such Lender in accordance with the final sentence of this Section 2.18. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by not less than one days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers in accordance with Article XIII, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be made. 2.19 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. (a) Unless the relevant Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been made. The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day, or (y) in the case of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan. 17
(b) The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Advance shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Advance, but no Lender, except as otherwise provided in the next sentence of this Section 2.19(b), shall be responsible for the failure of a Defaulting Lender to make the Loan to be made by such Defaulting Lender on the date of any Advance. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, but otherwise subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the failure by a Defaulting Lender to make a Loan required to be made by it hereunder (the amount not available being the "Unpaid Amount"), and each Lender shall immediately transfer to the Administrative Agent on such date the lesser of such Lender's proportionate share (based on its Commitment divided by the Commitments of all Lenders that have not so failed to fund their Loans) of the Unpaid Amount and its unused Commitment. Any such transfer shall be deemed to be a Floating Rate Loan by such Lender. Each Defaulting Lender shall pay on demand to each other Lender that makes a payment under this Section 2.19(b) the amount paid by such other Lender to cover such failure, together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such payment was made until the date such other Lender has been paid such amount in full, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus two percent (2%). 2.20 Replacement of Lender. If any Borrower is required pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any Lender's obligation to make or continue, or to convert Floating Rate Advances into, Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3, or if any Lender shall become a Defaulting Lender (any Lender so affected an "Affected Lender"), the Company may elect, if such amounts continue to be charged or such suspension is still effective, to replace such Affected Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that no Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, and provided further that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Advances and other Obligations due to the Affected Lender pursuant to an assignment substantially in the form of Exhibit C and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of Section 12.3 applicable to assignments, and (ii) the Borrowers shall pay to such Affected Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Affected Lender by the Borrowers hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to such Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5. Nothing herein shall release any Defaulting Lender from any obligation it may have to any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender. 2.21 Application of Payments with Respect to Defaulting Lenders. No payments of principal, interest or fees delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Defaulting Lender shall be delivered by the Administrative Agent to such Defaulting Lender. Instead, such payments shall, for so long as such Defaulting Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender, be held by the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized and directed by all parties hereto to hold such funds in escrow and apply such 18
funds to Loans required to be made by such Defaulting Lender on any Borrowing Date to the extent such Defaulting Lender fails to make such Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the termination of the Commitments and the payment and performance of all of the Obligations (other than those owing to a Defaulting Lender), any funds then held in escrow by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be distributed to each Defaulting Lender, pro rata in proportion to amounts that would be due to each Defaulting Lender but for the fact that it is a Defaulting Lender. ARTICLE III. YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES 3.1 Yield Protection.

Borrower shall pay such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction in amount received. (b) Non-U.S. Reserve Costs or Fees With Respect to Loans to Non-U.S. Borrowers. If any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive of any jurisdiction outside of the United States of America or any subdivision thereof (whether or not having the force of law) imposes or deems applicable any reserve requirement against or fee with respect to assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation, and the result of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or applicable Lending Installation of making or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans to any Borrower that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S. Borrower") or its Commitment to any Non-U.S. Borrower or to reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending Installation in connection with such Eurodollar Loans to any Non-U.S. Borrower or Commitment to any Non-U.S. Borrower, then, within 30 days of demand by such Lender, such Non-U.S. Borrower shall pay such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction in amount received, provided that such Non-U.S. Borrower shall not be required to compensate any Lender for such non-U.S. reserve costs or fees to the extent that an amount equal to such reserve costs or fees is received by such Lender as a result of the calculation of the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances pursuant to clause (i)(b) of the definition of "Eurodollar Rate." 3.2 Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender determines the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any entity controlling such Lender is increased as a result of a Change (as defined below), then, within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Company shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital which such Lender determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Loans or its Commitment to make Loans hereunder (after taking into account such Lender's policies as to capital adequacy). "Change" means (i) any change after the date of this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (ii) any adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of this Agreement which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation controlling any Lender.

If any Lender determines that maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not having the force of law, or if the Required Lenders determine that (i) deposits of a type, currency and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances are not available or (ii) the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances does not accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining Eurodollar Advances, then the Administrative Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar Advances and require any affected Eurodollar Advances to be repaid or converted to Floating Rate Advances at the end of the then current Interest Period for the affected Eurodollar Advance. 3.4 Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a Eurodollar Advance occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Eurodollar Advance is not made on the date specified by a Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, the Borrowers will indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including, without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits acquired to fund or maintain such Eurodollar Advance. 3.5 Taxes. (i) All payments by the Borrowers to or for the account of any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all Taxes. If any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, (a) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.5) such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (b) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (c) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law and (d) the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent the original copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof within 30 days after such payment is made. (ii) In addition, the Borrowers hereby agree to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or under any Note or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note ("Other Taxes"). (iii) The Borrowers hereby agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on amounts payable under this Section 3.5) paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. Payments due under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days of the date the Administrative Agent or such Lender makes demand therefor pursuant to Section 3.6. 21
(iv) Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S. Lender") agrees that it will, not less than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement, (i) deliver to each of the Company and the Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, certifying in either case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement from the Company and any other Borrower that is not a Non-U.S. Borrower without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, or (ii) deliver to each of the Company and the Administrative Agent a United States Internal Revenue Form W-8 or W-9, as the case may be, and certify that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Each Non-U.S. Lender further undertakes to deliver to each of the Company and the Administrative Agent (x) renewals or additional copies of such form (or any successor form) on or before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete, and (y) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such additional forms or amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent. All forms or amendments described in the preceding sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form or amendment with respect to it and such Lender advises the Company and the Administrative Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments from the Company and any other Borrower other than a Non-U.S. Borrower without any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax. (v) For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to provide the Company with an appropriate form pursuant to clause (iv), above (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5 with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that, should a Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required under clause (iv), above, the Company shall take such steps as such Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Non-U.S. Lender to recover such Taxes. (vi) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or any Note pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction or any treaty shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. (vii) If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental authority of the United States or any other country or any political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a 22
change in circumstances which rendered its exemption from withholding ineffective), such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this subsection, together with all costs and expenses related thereto (including attorneys fees and time charges of attorneys for the Administrative Agent, which attorneys may be employees of the Administrative Agent). The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 3.5(vii) shall survive the payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement. 3.6 Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrowers to such Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of Eurodollar Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. Each Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrowers in the absence of manifest error. Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type, currency and maturity corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not. Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be payable on demand after receipt by the Borrowers of such written statement. The obligations of the Borrowers under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement. ARTICLE IV. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 4.1 Initial Advance. The Lenders shall not be required to make the initial Advance hereunder unless the Borrowers have satisfied the following conditions: (a) Each Borrower has furnished to the Administrative Agent with sufficient copies for the Lenders: (i) Copies of the articles or certificate of incorporation of such Borrower, together with all amendments, and a certificate of good standing, each certified by the appropriate governmental officer in its jurisdiction of incorporation. 23

(c) Payment of the fees described in the letter agreement referred to in Section 10.13. 4.2 Each Advance.

(ii) The representations and warranties contained in Article V (other than Section 5.5, 5.7 and 5.15) are true and correct in all material respects as of such Borrowing Date except to the extent any such representation or warranty is stated to relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such representation or warranty shall have been true and correct on and as of such earlier date. (iii) All legal matters incident to the making of such Advance shall be satisfactory to the Lenders and their counsel. (iv) Each Borrowing Notice with respect to each such Advance and each Conversion/Continuation Notice shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower that the conditions contained in Sections 4.2(i) and (ii) have been satisfied. ARTICLE V. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES The Company and each of the Borrowers represents and warrants to the Lenders that: 5.1 Existence and Standing. Each of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership (in the case of Subsidiaries only) or limited liability company duly and properly incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted, except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 5.2 Authorization and Validity. Each Borrower has the power and authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Loan Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery by each Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper corporate or other proceedings, and the Loan Documents to which such Borrower is a party constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of such Borrower enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally. 5.3 No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and delivery by the Borrowers of the Loan Documents to which they are a party, nor the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof will violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, 25
injunction, decree or award binding on any Borrower or (ii) any Borrower's articles or certificate of incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of partnership, articles or certificate of organization, by-laws, code or regulations, or operating or other management agreement, as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to which any Borrower is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a default thereunder, or result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the Property of any Borrower pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, instrument or agreement. No order, consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by a Borrower, is required to be obtained by any Borrower in connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings under this Agreement, the payment and performance by such Borrower of the Obligations or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents. 5.4 Financial Statements. The following consolidated financial statements heretofore delivered to the Lenders were prepared in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles in effect on the date such statements were prepared and fairly present the consolidated financial condition and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries at such date and the consolidated results of their operations for the period then ended, subject, in the case of such interim statements, to routine year-end audit adjustments: (i) June 30, 2003 audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (ii) December 31, 2003 unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries. 5.5 Material Adverse Change. Since June 30, 2003 there has been no change in the business, Property, prospects, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 5.6 Taxes. The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all United States federal tax returns and all other tax returns which are required to be filed and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have been provided in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles and as to which no Lien exists. No tax liens have been filed and no claims are being asserted with respect to any such taxes which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of any taxes or other governmental charges are adequate. 26
5.7 Litigation and Contingent Obligations. Except as set forth on Schedule 7, there is no litigation, arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to the knowledge of any of their officers, threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay the making of any Advances. As of the date of this Agreement, other than any liability incident to any litigation, arbitration or proceeding which (i) could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) is set forth on Schedule 7, the Company has no material Contingent Obligations not provided for or disclosed in the financial statements referred to in Section 5.4. 5.8 Subsidiaries. Schedule 1 contains an accurate list of all Subsidiaries of the Company (other than immaterial or inactive Subsidiaries) and each Subsidiary Borrower as of the date of this Agreement, setting forth their respective jurisdictions of organization and the percentage of their respective capital stock or other ownership interests owned by the Company or other Subsidiaries. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other ownership interests of such Subsidiaries have been (to the extent such concepts are relevant with respect to such ownership interests) duly authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, except to the extent that the lack of such status could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company may amend Schedule 1 from time to time by delivering to the Administrative Agent an updated list of Subsidiaries, and the Company may designate any Subsidiary thereon which is directly or indirectly 80% (or, in the case of R.P. Scherer S.A., 75%) or more owned by the Company as a Subsidiary Borrower hereunder so long as (a) the Company guarantees the obligations of such new Subsidiary Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Guaranty, (b) such new Subsidiary Borrower delivers all corporate or organizational documents and authorizing resolutions and legal opinions reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, (c) such new Subsidiary Borrower agrees to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Borrowers and the new Subsidiary Borrower execute all agreements and take such other action reasonably requested by Administrative Agent and (d) all applicable Lenders are able (i) under their respective internal policies and guidelines with respect to (A) lending to borrowers located in certain foreign jurisdictions and (B) lending in certain foreign currencies and (ii) under all constitutions, laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, treaties, regulations, orders of courts or governmental authorities, to lend to such new Subsidiary Borrower. Schedule 1 may be amended to remove any Subsidiary as a Subsidiary Borrower upon (i) written notice by the Company to the Administrative Agent to such effect and (ii) repayment in full of all outstanding Loans of such Subsidiary Borrower. 5.9 ERISA. The Unfunded Liabilities of all Single Employer Plans do not in the aggregate exceed 2% of Adjusted Tangible Net Worth. Each Single Employer Plan complies in all material respects with all applicable requirements of law and regulations where the failure to so comply could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Reportable Event has occurred 27
with respect to any Plan where such occurrence could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries has withdrawn from any Plan or initiated steps to do so, and no steps have been taken to reorganize or terminate any Single Employer Plan where in either instance a liability in excess of 2% of Adjusted Tangible Net Worth could reasonably be expected to result. 5.10 Accuracy of Information. No information, exhibit or report furnished by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent or to any Lender in connection with the negotiation of, or compliance with, the Loan Documents contained any material misstatement of fact or omitted to state a material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading; provided, however, that to the extent any such information, exhibits or reports include or incorporate by reference any forward-looking statement (each, a "Forward-Looking Statement") which reflects the Company's current view (as of the date such Forward-Looking Statement is made) with respect to future events, prospects, projections or financial performance, such Forward-Looking Statement is subject to uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from such Forward-Looking Statement. 5.11 Regulation U. Margin stock (as defined in Regulation U) constitutes less than 25% of the value of those assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries which are subject to any limitation on sale, pledge, or other restriction hereunder. 5.12 Maintenance of Property. The Company and its Subsidiaries, maintain all Property and keep such Property in good repair, working order and condition in accordance with customary and prudent business practices for similar businesses, except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect. 5.13 Insurance. The Company, and each Significant Subsidiary, maintains as part of a self-insurance program, or with financially sound and reputable insurance companies, insurance on all their Property in such amounts (with such customary deductibles, exclusions and self-insurance) and covering such risks as is consistent with sound business practice. 5.14 Plan Assets; Prohibited Transactions. The Company is not an entity deemed to hold "plan assets" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 of an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) which is subject to Title I of ERISA or any plan (within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code), and neither the execution of this Agreement nor the making of Advances hereunder gives rise to a prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. 28
5.15 Environmental Matters. In the ordinary course of its business, the officers of the Company consider the effect of Environmental Laws on the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in the course of which they identify and evaluate potential risks and liabilities accruing to the Company due to Environmental Laws. On the basis of this consideration, the Company has concluded that Environmental Laws cannot reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any notice to the effect that its operations are not in material compliance with any of the requirements of applicable Environmental Laws or are the subject of any federal or state investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is needed to respond to a release of any toxic or hazardous waste or substance into the environment, which non-compliance or remedial action could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 5.16 Investment Company Act. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 5.17 Public Utility Holding Company Act. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended. 5.18 Default. There exists no Default or Unmatured Default under Article VII of this Agreement. ARTICLE VI. COVENANTS During the term of this Agreement, unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise consent in writing: 6.1 Financial Reporting. The Company will maintain, for itself and each Subsidiary, a system of accounting established and administered in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles, and furnish to the Lenders: (i) Within 120 days after the close of each of its fiscal years, an unqualified (except for qualifications relating to changes in accounting principles or practices reflecting changes in Agreement Accounting Principles and required or approved by the 29

(v) As soon as possible and in any event within 10 Business Days after receipt by the Company, a copy of (a) any notice or claim to the effect that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be liable to any Person as a result of the release by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any other Person of any toxic or hazardous waste or substance into the environment, and (b) any notice alleging any violation of any federal, state or local environmental, health or safety law or regulation by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (vi) Such other information (including non-financial information) as the Administrative Agent or any Lender may from time to time reasonably request. 6.2 Use of Proceeds. The Company will, and will cause each Subsidiary to, use the proceeds of the Advances for general corporate purposes, including Acquisitions and commercial paper back up. The Company will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to, use any of the proceeds of the Advances to purchase or carry any "margin stock" (as defined in Regulation U). 6.3 Notice of Default. The Company will, and will cause each Borrower and Significant Subsidiary to, give prompt notice in writing to the Administrative Agent of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default and of any other development, financial or otherwise, which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 30

The Company will, and will cause each Significant Subsidiary to, carry on and conduct its business in substantially the same manner and in substantially the same fields of enterprise as it is presently conducted or fields related thereto (except that the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries shall have no duty to renew or extend contracts which expire by their terms) and do all things necessary to remain duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in good standing as a domestic corporation, partnership or limited liability company in its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, as the case may be, and maintain all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted, unless the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company will, and will cause each Significant Subsidiary, to maintain, preserve and protect all Property and keep such property in good repair, working order and condition and from time to time make, or cause to be made all needful and proper repairs, renewals, additions, improvements and replacements thereto necessary in order that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times in accordance with customary and prudent business practices for similar businesses, except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 6.5 Taxes. The Company will, and will cause each Significant Subsidiary to, timely file complete and correct United States federal and applicable foreign, state and local tax returns required by law and pay when due all taxes, assessments and governmental charges and levies upon it or its income, profits or Property, except those which are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which adequate reserves have been set aside in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles, except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 6.6 Insurance. The Company will, and will cause each Significant Subsidiary to, maintain as part of a self-insurance program or with financially sound and reputable insurance companies insurance on all their Property in such amounts (with such customary deductibles, exclusions and self-insurance) and covering such risks as is consistent with sound business practice. 6.7 Compliance with Laws. The Company will, and will cause each Significant Subsidiary to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs, judgments, injunctions, decrees or awards to which it may be subject including, without limitation, all Environmental Laws, except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 6.8 Inspection. 31

The Company will not, nor will it permit any Significant Subsidiary to, lease, sell or otherwise dispose of its Property, to any other Person (other than the Company or another Subsidiary), except: (i) Sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business. (ii) Sales or other dispositions in the ordinary course of business of fixed assets for the purpose of replacing such fixed assets, provided that such fixed assets are replaced within 360 days of such sale or other disposition with other fixed assets which have a fair market value not materially less than the fixed assets sold or otherwise disposed of. (iii) Sales or other dispositions outside the ordinary course of business of accounts receivable, lease receivables, leases or equipment which had been leased by the Company or such Significant Subsidiary, provided that any such sale or other disposition is for reasonably equivalent value and could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(v) Liens existing on the date hereof. (vi) Liens on any assets which exist at the time of acquisition of such assets by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or liens to secure the payment of all of any part of the purchase price of such assets upon the acquisition of such assets by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to secure any Indebtedness incurred or guaranteed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to, at the time, of or within 360 days after, such acquisition (or, in the case of real property, the completion of construction (including any improvements on an existing asset) or commencement of full operation of such asset, whichever is later), which Indebtedness is incurred or guaranteed for the purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price thereof or, in the case of real property, construction or improvements thereon, provided, however, that in the case of any such acquisition, construction or improvement, the Lien shall not apply to such assets theretofore owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than, in the case of any such construction or improvement, any real property on which the property so constructed, or the improvement, is located, provided further, however, that the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness secured by Liens permitted by this Section 6.12(vi) shall not at any time exceed 10% of Adjusted Tangible Net Worth.

ARTICLE VIII. ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES 8.1 Acceleration. If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 occurs with respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall immediately become due and payable without any election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender. If any other Default occurs and is continuing, the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) may terminate or suspend the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder, or declare the Obligations to be due and payable, or both, whereupon the Obligations shall become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which the Company hereby expressly waives. If, within 60 days after acceleration of the maturity of the Obligations or termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 with respect to the Company) and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or entered, the Required Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Company, rescind and annul such acceleration and/or termination. 8.2 Amendments. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII, the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent in writing of the Required Lenders) and the Borrowers may enter into written agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the Borrowers hereunder or waiving any Default hereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental written agreement shall, without the consent of all of the Lenders: 39
(i) Extend the final maturity of any Loan or postpone any regularly scheduled payment of principal of any Loan or forgive all or any portion of the principal amount thereof or any accrued interest or accrued fees, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or fees thereon. (ii) Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders or any provision that requires the unanimous consent or pro rata treatment of Lenders. (iii) Extend the Facility Termination Date or reduce the amount or extend the payment date for, the mandatory payments required under Section 2.2, or increase the amount of the Aggregate Commitment or of the Commitment of any Lender hereunder, or permit any Borrower to assign its rights under this Agreement (other than as may be permitted pursuant to Section 6.9). (iv) Amend this Section 8.2. (v) Release the Company as guarantor of any Advance. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Administrative Agent shall be effective without the written consent of the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may waive payment of the fee required under Section 12.3.2 without obtaining the consent of any other party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to vote (whether to consent or to withhold its consent) with respect to any amendment, modification, termination or waiver requiring the consent of the Required Lenders, and, for purposes of determining the Required Lenders, the Commitments and the Loans of each Defaulting Lender shall be disregarded. 8.3 Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or the Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and the making of an Advance notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability of a Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders until the later of (a) the Facility Termination Date and (b) the date on which the Obligations have been paid in full. 40

The respective obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the Administrative Agent is authorized to act as such).

The obligations of the Company under this Section 9.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 9.7 Numbers of Documents. All statements, notices, closing documents, and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Administrative Agent with sufficient counterparts so that the Administrative Agent may furnish one to each of the Lenders. 9.8 Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles except that any calculation or determination which is to be made on a consolidated basis shall be made for the Company and all its Subsidiaries, including those Subsidiaries, if any, which are unconsolidated on the Company's audited financial statements. 9.9 Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable. 9.10 Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Company on the one hand and the Lenders and the Administrative Agent on the other hand shall be solely that of borrower and lender. Neither the 42
Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Company solely by reason of being a party to this Agreement. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers nor any Lender undertakes any responsibility to the Company to review or inform the Company of any matter in connection with any phase of the Company's business or operations. The Company agrees that neither the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers nor any Lender shall have liability to the Company (whether sounding in tort, contract or otherwise) for losses suffered by the Company in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to, the transactions contemplated and the relationship established by the Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith, unless it is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such losses resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party from which recovery is sought. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers nor any Lender shall have any liability with respect to, and the Company hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue for, any special, indirect or consequential damages suffered by the Company in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby. 9.11 Confidentiality; Disclosure.

Each Lender hereby represents that it is not relying on or looking to any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) for the repayment of the Advances provided for herein. 43

Wachovia is hereby appointed by each of the Lenders as its contractual representative (herein referred to as the "Administrative Agent") hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the contractual representative of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent agrees to act as such contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in this Article X. Notwithstanding the use of the defined term "Administrative Agent," it is expressly understood and agreed that the Administrative Agent shall not have any fiduciary responsibilities to any Lender by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and that the Administrative Agent is merely acting as the contractual representative of the Lenders with only those duties as are expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In its capacity as the Lenders' contractual representative, the Administrative Agent (i) does not hereby assume any fiduciary duties to any of the Lenders, (ii) is a "representative" of the Lenders within the meaning of Section 9-105 of the Uniform Commercial Code and (iii) is acting as an independent contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited to those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each of the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim against the Administrative Agent on any agency theory or any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of which claims each Lender hereby waives. 10.2 Powers. The Administrative Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents to be taken by the Administrative Agent. 10.3 General Immunity. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Company, the Lenders or any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except to the extent such action or inaction is determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person. 10.4 No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any borrowing 44
hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including, without limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article IV, except receipt of items required to be delivered solely to the Administrative Agent; (d) the existence or possible existence of any Default or Unmatured Default; (e) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith; (f) the value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or priority of any Lien in any collateral security; or (g) the financial condition of the Company or any guarantor of any of the Obligations or of any of the Company's or any such guarantor's respective Subsidiaries.

The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. 10.6 Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties as Administrative Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

10.8 Administrative Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (i) for any amounts not reimbursed by the Company for which the Administrative Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the Company under the Loan Documents (other than the fee payable pursuant to Section 10.13), (ii) for any other expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with any dispute between the Administrative Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such amounts incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in connection with any dispute between the Administrative Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other documents, provided that (i) no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent and (ii) any indemnification required pursuant to Section 3.5(vii) shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions thereof. The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall survive payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement and the Commitments. 10.9 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default hereunder, except with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Company referring to this Agreement describing such Default or Unmatured Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. 10.10 Rights as a Lender. In the event the Administrative Agent is a Lender, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, at any time when the Administrative Agent is a Lender, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity. The Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may 46
accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Company or such Subsidiary is not restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person. The Administrative Agent, in its individual capacity, is not obligated to remain a Lender. 10.11 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers or any other Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Company and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 10.12 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Company, such resignation to be effective upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent or, if no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed, forty-five days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its intention to resign. The Administrative Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by written notice received by the Administrative Agent from the Required Lenders, such removal to be effective on the date specified by the Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, on behalf of the Company and the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent shall (unless a Default shall have occurred and be continuing) be approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty days after the resigning Administrative Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning Administrative Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Company and the Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, without the consent of any Lender but upon thirty days prior written notice to the Lenders and the Company, the Administrative Agent may appoint any of its Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a successor Administrative Agent hereunder, which successor Administrative Agent shall (unless a Default shall have occurred and be continuing) be approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the Administrative Agent has resigned or been removed and no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder and the Company shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the Lenders. No successor Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor Administrative Agent has accepted the appointment. Any such successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $5,000,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such 47
successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Administrative Agent. Upon the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, the resigning or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of an Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for the benefit of such Administrative Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the event that there is a successor to the Administrative Agent by merger, or the Administrative Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used in this Agreement shall mean the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new Administrative Agent. 10.13 Administrative Agent's Fee. The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the fees agreed to by the Company, Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and the Administrative Agent pursuant to that certain letter agreement dated March 2, 2004 or as otherwise agreed from time to time. 10.14 Delegation to Affiliates. The Company and the Lenders agree that the Administrative Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates. Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents and employees) which performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall be entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other protective provisions to which the Administrative Agent is entitled under Articles IX and X. 10.15 Administrative Agent, Syndication Agents, Documentation Agents, Lead Arrangers, etc. Neither the Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agents nor the Lead Arrangers shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders or the Administrative Agent shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to such Lenders as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in Section 10.11. ARTICLE XI. SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS 11.1 Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the Lenders under applicable law, if any Borrower becomes insolvent, however evidenced, or any Default occurs and is continuing, any and all deposits (including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or 48
not collected or available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit or account of any Borrower may be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part hereof, shall then be due. 11.2 Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than that received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a portion of the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its Pro Rata Share of the Loans. If any Lender, whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares of the Loans. In case any such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further adjustments shall be made. If an amount to be setoff is to be applied to Indebtedness of the Company to a Lender other than Indebtedness comprised of Loans made by such Lender, such amount shall be applied ratably to such other Indebtedness and to the Indebtedness comprised of such Loans. ARTICLE XII. BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS 12.1 Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrowers and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) the Borrowers shall not have the right to assign their rights or obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section 12.3. Notwithstanding clause (ii) of this Section, any Lender may at any time, without the consent of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, assign all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however, that no such assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank shall release the transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder. The Administrative Agent may treat the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with Section 12.3 in the case of an assignment thereof or, in the case of any other transfer, a written notice of the transfer is filed with the Administrative Agent. Any assignee or transferee of the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by acceptance of such transfer or assignment to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of the rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of the rights to such Loan. 49
12.2 Participations. 12.2.1. Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in its sole discretion, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the owner of its Loans and the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrowers under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participating interests, and the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. 12.2.2. Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Advance or Commitment in which such Participant has an interest which forgives principal, interest or fees or reduces the interest rate or fees payable with respect to any such Advance or Commitment, extends the Facility Termination Date, postpones any date fixed for any regularly-scheduled payment of principal of, or interest or fees on, any such Advance or Commitment, releases the Company as guarantor of any such Loan or releases any of the collateral, if any, securing any such Advance. 12.2.3. Benefit of Setoff. The Company agrees that each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender. 12.3 Assignments. 12.3.1. Permitted Assignments. 50
Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time assign to one or more financial institutions, mutual funds, insurance companies or other entities engaged in the business of extending credit for borrowed money ("Purchasers") all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. Such assignment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit C or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. The consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent shall be required (which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) prior to an assignment becoming effective with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof or an Approved Fund; provided, however, that if a Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of the Company shall not be required. The assignor shall give prompt written notice to the Company of any assignment becoming effective without the consent of the Company. Each such assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof shall (unless each of the Company and the Administrative Agent otherwise consents) be in an amount not less than the lesser of (i) $5,000,000 and in multiples of $1,000,000 or (ii) the remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment (calculated as at the date of such assignment) or outstanding Loans (if the applicable Commitment has been terminated). 12.3.2. Effect; Effective Date. Upon (i) delivery to the Administrative Agent of an assignment, together with any consents required by Section 12.3.1, and (ii) payment of a $3,500 fee to the Administrative Agent for processing such assignment (unless such fee is waived by the Administrative Agent), such assignment shall become effective on the effective date specified in such assignment. The assignment shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Loans under the applicable assignment agreement constitutes "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents will not be "plan assets" under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto, and no further consent or action by the Company, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent shall be required to release the transferor Lender with respect to the percentage of the Aggregate Commitment and Loans assigned to such Purchaser. Upon the consummation of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3.2, the transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers shall, if the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment. 12.4 Dissemination of Information. The Company authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession concerning the creditworthiness of the Company and its Subsidiaries, provided that 51
each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees in writing to be bound by Section 9.11 of this Agreement. 12.5 Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 3.5(iv). 12.6 Transfer to an SPC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Company, the option to provide to the Borrowers all or any part of any Loan (other than an Alternate Currency Loan) that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 12.6, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Company and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Company and the Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. As this Section applies to any particular SPC, this section may not be amended without the written consent of such SPC. ARTICLE XIII. NOTICES 13.1 Notices. 52
Except as otherwise permitted by Section 2.15 with respect to borrowing notices, all notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be in writing (including electronic transmission, facsimile transmission or similar writing) and shall be given to such party: (x) in the case of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, at its address or facsimile number set forth on the signature pages hereof, (y) in the case of any Lender, at its address or facsimile number set forth below its signature hereto or (z) in the case of any party, at such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify for the purpose by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.1. Each such notice, request or other communication shall be effective (i) if given by facsimile transmission, when transmitted to the facsimile number specified in this Section and confirmation of receipt is received, (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication is deposited in the mails with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid, or (iii) if given by any other means, when delivered (or, in the case of electronic transmission, received) at the address specified in this Section; provided that notices to the Administrative Agent under Article II shall not be effective until received. 13.2 Change of Address. The Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and any Lender may each change the address for service of notice upon it by 5 days' prior written notice to the other parties hereto. ARTICLE XIV. COUNTERPARTS This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. This Agreement shall be effective when it has been executed by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and each party has notified the Administrative Agent by facsimile transmission or telephone that it has taken such action. ARTICLE XV. CHOICE OF LAW; CONSENT TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL 15.1 CHOICE OF LAW. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINING A CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 735 ILCS SECTION 105/5-1 ET SEQ, BUT OTHERWISE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS) OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS. 15.2 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. 53
EACH BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR ILLINOIS STATE COURT SITTING IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND EACH BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ANY BORROWER IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY ANY BORROWER AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY LENDER INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS. 15.3 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE BORROWERS, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH LENDER HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER. 54

EXHIBITS
EXHIBIT A FORM OF OPINION [PRINT ON CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. LETTERHEAD] March __, 2004 The Administrative Agent and the Lenders who are parties to the Credit Agreement described below. Subject: CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. -- 2004 FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT. Gentlemen/Ladies: I am counsel for Cardinal Health, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), and have represented the Company in connection with its execution and delivery of a 2004 Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of March __, 2004 (the "Agreement"), among the Company, the Subsidiary Borrowers, the Lenders named therein, and Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, providing for Advances in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $750,000,000 at any one time outstanding. All capitalized terms used in this opinion and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Agreement. This opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(v) of the Agreement. In connection with the issuance of this opinion letter, I have examined the following documents: (a) A copy of the Agreement executed by the Company; (b) The Company's Articles of Incorporation; (c) The Company's Code of Regulations; (d) A certificate of good standing of the Company issued by the Ohio Secretary of State; (e) Resolutions of the Company's board of directors; (f) An executed copy of each of the following notes: (i) a note from the Company to PNC Bank, National Association dated March __, 2004;
(ii) a note from the Company to SunTrust Bank dated March __, 2004; and (iii) a note from the Company to Wachovia Bank, National Association dated March __, 2004; (g) An executed copy of the Guaranty Agreement of the Company dated as of March __, 2004; (h) Certificates of certain officers of the Company as to certain factual matters; and (i) Such other documents and matters of law as I deemed necessary or advisable in order to render the opinions set forth in this letter. The documents referenced in items (a), (f), and (g) are sometimes referred to hereinafter as the "Loan Documents." In my review and in rendering the opinions expressed herein, I have assumed, without independent verification, the following: (I) the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to me as certified, facsimile, or photostatic copies, the completeness and correctness of any representations and certifications made to me by officers of the Company, and the completeness and correctness of any representations and certificates of public officials and public filing records; (II) that the Loan Documents have been duly and validly authorized, executed, and delivered by all parties thereto other than the Company, and that the Loan Documents are binding and legally enforceable against all of the parties thereto, other than the Company; (III) all parties to the Loan Documents other than the Company have received adequate consideration for their execution and delivery of, and performance of their respective obligations under, the Loan Documents to which each of them is a party; and (IV) all conditions and other transactions contemplated by the Agreement to have occurred at or prior to the funding of the initial Loans or have been waived by the appropriate parties and Loans in the amount of the Aggregate Commitment will be fully available pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications set forth below, I am of the opinion that: 1. The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Ohio. 2. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by proper corporate proceedings on the part of the Company and will not:
(a) Require any consent of the Company's shareholders; (b) (i) Violate (A) any order, judgment, or decree of any court or governmental agency binding on the Company and known to me, (B) any statute of the State of Ohio or the United States, or any written regulation thereunder, (C) the Company's articles of incorporation or code of regulations, or (D) the provisions of any indenture, instrument, or agreement to which the Company is a party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, and which is filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Company's periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, pursuant to item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or (ii) conflict with or constitute a default under any such indenture, instrument, or agreement; or (c) Result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in or on the Property of the Company pursuant to the terms of any indenture, instrument or agreement binding upon the Company, and which is filed or incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Company's periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, pursuant to item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 3. The Loan Documents to which the Company is a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, except for the "choice of law" provisions of the Loan Documents, constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms. Set forth later in this opinion letter is an opinion regarding the enforceability of the "choice of law" provisions of the Loan Documents. 4. To the best of my knowledge and except as set forth in Schedule 7 of the Agreement, there is no litigation, arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding, or inquiry pending or threatened against the Company which, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. 5. No authorization or approval of, or filing with, any governmental agency of the United States or of the State of Ohio which has not been obtained or made is necessary for the execution and delivery of, and performance of the Company's obligations under the Loan Documents. In addition to any other qualification set forth herein, my opinions are qualified as (A) I wish to advise you that I do not express any opinion with respect to: (1) the power or authority of the Lenders to make the loans contemplated by the Agreement; (2) compliance by the Lenders with any federal or state banking law, rule, regulation, or restriction; or (3) compliance by the Lenders with any federal,
state, or foreign law, rule, regulation, or restriction which is or was required to be complied with by the Lenders (as opposed to compliance therewith by the Company) in order to enforce any rights or remedies of the Lenders under the Loan Documents. Accordingly, all of the foregoing opinions expressed by me are qualified to the extent set forth in the preceding sentence. (B) To the extent that the foregoing opinions are stated to be to the best of my knowledge, or relate to matters which are known to me, I have, with your consent, relied on one or more certificates of officers of the Company as to factual matters, and I have neither independently investigated nor attempted to verify any of such matters. (C) I have made no examination of and express no opinion as to: (1) the right, title, or interest of any person to any property; (2) the accuracy or sufficiency of the description in the Loan Documents of any real or personal property; or (3) the existence of or freedom of any property from any liens, security interests, or other encumbrances. (D) My opinions are subject to and affected by: (1) any bankruptcy, insolvency, avoidance, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally; and (2) general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). (E) I express no opinion as to whether a court would limit the exercise or enforcement of rights or remedies by the Lenders under the Loan Documents: (1) in the event of any default by the Company, if it is determined that such default is not material or if such exercise or enforcement is not reasonably necessary for the protection of the Lenders; or (2) if the exercise or enforcement thereof under the circumstances would violate an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (F) Certain waivers and exculpatory clauses contained in the Loan Documents may be limited or unenforceable under applicable law; but in my opinion, such law does not, subject to the other qualifications and exceptions stated elsewhere in this opinion, make the remedies afforded by the Loan Documents inadequate for the practical realization of the principal benefits purported to be provided thereby. (G) No opinion is expressed with respect to the validity or enforceability of those provisions of the Loan Documents which
purport by their terms to relieve any party of, or to indemnify such party against, any liability for such party's own negligence, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, or to obligate the Company to bear the legal and other expenses of any other party. (H) I am authorized to practice law in Ohio, and no opinion is expressed herein other than as to the laws of the State of Ohio and federal law. With your permission, for purposes of the opinion set forth in paragraph 3, I have assumed that the substantive laws of the State of Ohio, except for conflict of laws principles, would govern the Loan Documents. In addition to the foregoing opinions, you have also requested my opinion regarding whether an Ohio court would enforce the "choice of law" provisions of the Loan Documents (the "Choice of Law Provisions") against the Company. In Schulke Radio Prod. v. Midwestern Broadcast, 453 N.E. 2d 683 (Ohio 1983), the Ohio Supreme Court held that the rule set forth in the Restatement of Law 2d (1971) 561, Conflict of Laws, Section 187, is to be applied in determining whether or not a contractual choice of law provision will be enforced by an Ohio court. The relevant part of Section 187 is set forth below: "(2) The law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied, even if the particular issue is one which the parties could not have resolved by an explicit provision in their agreement directed to that issue, unless either (a) the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties' choice, or (b) application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and which, under the rule of Section 188, would be the state of the applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties." In Schulke, the agreement at issue included a term providing that it was to be governed by New York law. One of the parties to the agreement was located in New York and executed the agreement in New York. In addition, performance under the agreement also took place in New York. Based upon the foregoing, the Ohio Supreme Court concluded that New York did bear a substantial relationship to the parties and the agreement. Schulke, 453 N.E. 2d 686. Similarly, Comment (f) to Section 187 of the Restatement states that a substantial relationship exists when the state of choice is where performance by one of the parties is to take place or where one of the parties has its principal place of business.
In rendering the following opinion, I have assumed, with your approval and without independent verification, that the following facts and statements are true and accurate in all respects: (i) The Syndication Agent and Co-Lead Arranger's principal office is located in Illinois; (ii) The Loan Documents are being executed by certain of the Lenders in Illinois; (iii) In selecting the laws of the State of Illinois to govern the Loan Documents, the parties acted in good faith and without an intent to evade the law; and (iv) The application of the laws of the State of Illinois to the Loan Documents will not be contrary to any fundamental policy of any state which has a materially greater interest than the State of Illinois in the determination of any particular right, duty, or obligation of any party under the Loan Documents. Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and assumptions set forth herein, I am of the opinion that it would be more likely than not that an Ohio court would enforce the Choice of Law Provisions based upon a determination by such court that the Loan Documents and the parties thereto have a substantial relationship with the State of Illinois. The opinions set forth herein are given as of the date hereof, and I disclaim any obligation to notify you or any other person or entity if any change in fact or law, or both (whether statutory, regulatory, regulatory interpretation or judicial interpretation), should change my opinion with respect to any matter set forth herein. This opinion may be relied upon and is solely for the benefit of the Addressees at the beginning of this opinion (and also any Purchasers, but not any Participants), and it is not to be made available to or relied upon by any other party or communicated or disclosed to any other person without my prior written consent. Sincerely, Steve Falk, Associate General Counsel - Corporate Governance and Mergers & Acquisitions

Annex 3 Pricing Schedule
PRICING SCHEDULE The Applicable Margin shall be as determined by the matrix below: For the purposes of this Schedule, the following terms have the following meanings, subject to the final paragraph of this Schedule: "Level I Status" exists at any date if, on such date, the Company's Moody's Rating is Al or better, the Company's S&P Rating is A+ or better and the Company's Fitch Rating is A+ or better. "Level II Status" exists at any date if, on such date, (i) the Company has not qualified for Level I Status and (ii) the Company's Moody's Rating is A2 or better, the Company's S&P Rating is A or better, and the Company's Fitch Rating is A or better. "Level III Status" exists at any date if, on such date, (i) the Company has not qualified for Level I Status or Level II Status and (ii) the Company's Moody's Rating is A3 or better, the Company's S&P Rating is A- or better, and the Company's Fitch Rating is A- or better. "Level IV Status" exists at any date if, on such date, (i) the Company has not qualified for Level I Status, Level II Status or Level III Status and (ii) the Company's Moody's Rating is Baal or better, the Company's S&P rating is BBB+ or better, and the Company's Fitch Rating is BBB+ or better. "Level V Status" exists at any date if, on such date, the Company has not qualified for Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III Status, or Level IV Status. The Applicable Margin shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing table based on the Company's Status as determined from its then-current Moody's, S&P and Fitch Ratings. The credit rating in effect on any date for the purposes of this Schedule is that in effect at the close of business on such date. If at any time the Company has no Moody's Rating, no S&P Rating and no Fitch Rating, Level V Status shall exist. In the event that a split occurs between the three (3) ratings, then the following shall apply:
(a) if two (2) of the three (3) ratings established by or deemed to have been established by S&P, Moody's or Fitch fall within the same Level, but one (1) rating falls within a different Level, the Applicable Margin shall be based upon the two (2) ratings that fall within the same Level; and (b) if all three (3) ratings established by or deemed to have been established by S&P, Moody's or Fitch each fall within a different Level, the Applicable Margin shall be based upon the middle rating of the three (3). "Moody's Rating" means, at any time, the rating issued by Moody's and then in effect with respect to the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt securities without third-party credit enhancement. "S&P Rating" means, at any time, the rating issued by S&P, and then in effect with respect to the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt securities without third-party credit enhancement. "Fitch Rating" means, at any time, the rating issued by Fitch and then in effect with respect to the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt securities without third-party credit enhancement. "Status" means Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III Status, Level IV Status, or Level V Status.
