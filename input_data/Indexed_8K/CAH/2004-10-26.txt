Exhibit 99.01 CARDINAL HEALTH FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACTS: Media: Jim Mazzola Investors: Jim Hinrichs (614) 757-3690 (614) 757-7828 jim.mazzola@cardinal.com jim.hinrichs@cardinal.com CARDINAL HEALTH ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS, FILES FISCAL 2004 10-K DUBLIN, OHIO, OCT. 26, 2004-- Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE: CAH), the leading provider of products and services supporting the health care industry, announced fourth-quarter and fiscal 2004 results concurrent with the filing today of its fiscal 2004 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For the quarter ended June 30, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), revenues rose 11 percent to $16.9 billion and increased 15 percent to $65.1 billion for the fiscal year. Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were up 11 percent to $397.4 million, and increased 10 percent to $1.5 billion on a full-year basis. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter were $0.91, an increase of 15 percent. For the year, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 14 percent to $3.47. Cardinal Health Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert D. Walter said: "Overall, solid progress was made during the year and the financial results we delivered were in line with our revised expectations. Certain businesses performed below our historic standards, but we also experienced continued strong contributions from others, most notably our Medical Products and Services segment. In Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services, the business model transition underway put pressure on our earnings; however, over the long-term, we believe the future of pharmaceutical distribution is secure. We provide a valuable service to manufacturers that continues to be validated in the marketplace. Looking forward, we will continue to strengthen our market positions in all segments and remain committed to achieving our long-term performance goals." FORM 10-K FILING On Sept. 13, Cardinal Health announced initial conclusions from an internal review by the Audit Committee of its board of directors, assisted by independent counsel, which began in April. Updated details of these and additional findings by the Audit Committee are -more-

(Cardinal Health's Form 10-K is available on the Investor Relations page at www.cardinal.com.) FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE After tax, special items during the quarter totaled $25.3 million, primarily related to the integration of recently acquired businesses. For the year, special items after tax totaled $35.6 million. (The following discussion includes the effect of restatements and adjusts certain amounts to exclude special items. Please see the attached financial table for a reconciliation of the GAAP amounts to the amounts excluding these items.) Results for key measures include: o REVENUE rose 11 percent to $16.9 billion for the quarter and 15 percent to $65.1 billion for the year. o EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE from continuing operations before special items rose 13 percent for the fourth quarter to $0.97 versus $0.86 last year. For the year, earnings per share from continuing operations before special items increased 14 percent to $3.55. Earnings from continuing operations before special items rose 8 percent to $423 million for the quarter and reached $1.6 billion for the year, an increase of 10 percent over fiscal 2003. o RETURN ON EQUITY before special items was 20.7 percent for the year, even with the prior year. o CASH FLOW from operations for fiscal 2004 was $2.6 billion. Free cash flow of $1.1 billion in the quarter was the result of strong earnings combined with focused asset management. For the year, free cash flow rose to $2.2 billion, or 148 percent of net earnings. STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RESULTS Cardinal Health made progress during the year using strategies to build scale and drive competitive advantage in the health care industry, expand product and service offerings, and make investments to deliver new levels of customer value through integrated solutions. A total of $4.5 billion of capital was deployed for the year, including more than $400 million in capital investments, $1.5 billion to repurchase 24.2 million shares of Cardinal Health stock and $2.6 billion to fund strategic acquisitions. The company's Integrated Provider Solutions strategy continued to gain momentum and deliver value to hospital customers. Revenues from corporate agreements with health systems, which include products and services from multiple business units, increased 20 percent for the year. These strategic agreements now total more than $7 billion annually. -more-
CARDINAL HEALTH ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS, FILES FISCAL 2004 10-K PAGE 3 Under its Integrated Provider Solutions strategy, Cardinal Health has aligned its resources for hospital customers, which contribute more than 50 percent of the company's earnings. Strong pharmaceutical demand drove a revenue increase within the PHARMACEUTICAL DISTRIBUTION AND PROVIDER SERVICES segment of 12 percent for the quarter and 15 percent on a full-year basis. Operating earnings growth, however, was flat for the quarter and decreased 1 percent for the year due to the ongoing transition in how pharmaceutical manufacturers pay for the distribution services Cardinal Health provides. As this transition takes effect, Cardinal Health expects to be paid fees for distribution services on a non-contingent basis as services are provided. The transition is expected to improve returns and provide greater visibility to future earnings. In August, the company notified pharmaceutical manufacturers of a change in policy intended to transition existing distribution contracts to fee-based agreements by the next anniversary date of current agreements or April 1, 2005. Cardinal Health's MEDICAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES segment reported above-market revenue and earnings growth for the quarter and full year, including a double-digit increase in sales to physicians' offices and acute care facilities during the period. New product introductions and distribution contracts also fueled growth. Revenues from medical products and services now total more than $7.3 billion annually - an increase of 11 percent over the prior year - and operating earnings were up 13 percent to $666 million. Revenues in the PHARMACEUTICAL TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES segment rose 4 percent during the quarter, while operating earnings improved 14 percent, led by strength in the company's Intercare operations. Intercare was acquired earlier in the year to expand Cardinal Health's global reach, enhance proprietary sterile manufacturing capabilities and broaden the company's participation in the European generic and injectible product markets. These results were partially offset by declines in oral products, whose year ago results included the key launch period for Mylan's Amnesteen(R) softgel product, and the slower-than-expected ramp up of production in certain sterile manufacturing projects with associated start up costs. For the full year, segment revenue increased 25 percent to $2.8 billion, and operating earnings grew 26 percent to $465 million. Excluding acquisitions, operating earnings would have increased 8 percent for the segment. Capital spending pressure on hospital customers and the effect of product mix issues during the quarter contributed to a decline in revenues and earnings within the AUTOMATION AND INFORMATION SERVICES segment. For the year, revenues increased 2 percent to $681 million and operating earnings grew 2 percent to $270 million. With the $2 billion acquisition of Alaris Medical Systems now complete, the company has established a new financial reporting segment called CLINICAL TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES. Results for this segment, which will include Alaris products, Pyxis products and associated clinical services, will be reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and will replace the company's current Automation and Information Services segment. (Tables with specific segment results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year are available at the Investor Relations page on www.cardinal.com.) -more-
CARDINAL HEALTH ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS, FILES FISCAL 2004 10-K PAGE 4 OUTLOOK Based on current business conditions, the company expects earnings per share to decline by 10 percent to 15 percent for the first half of fiscal 2005, with a decline of approximately 25 percent in the first quarter. The largest factor contributing to this decline is the ongoing business model transition in Cardinal Health's pharmaceutical distribution segment. Challenges in other business segments will also contribute to the decline, including margin pressure on medical products, delays in the start-up of manufacturing in Humacao, Puerto Rico, associated costs of new sterile manufacturing projects and continued pressure on the sale of automation systems. Cardinal Health has initiated strategic and operational actions to improve long-term results, including a restructuring program targeting cost structure improvements of $125 million in fiscal 2005, with greater annual savings over a three-year period. Cardinal Health maintains an earnings-per-share growth goal of at least 10 percent for the fiscal year. Achievement of this goal, however, is dependent on the benefits of this restructuring program and operational progress, most notably in its pharmaceutical distribution business. The company continues to target long-term financial goals of: o Annual earnings-per-share growth in the mid-teens or better; o Revenue growth in the low-to-mid-teens, faster than growth in the markets in which the company competes; o Free cash flow greater than or equal to 60 percent of net earnings; o Return on equity of more than 20 percent annually. SEC INVESTIGATION As previously reported, in October 2003, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry regarding Cardinal Health seeking historical financial and related information. In May, the company was notified that the SEC had converted the informal inquiry into a formal investigation. In June, as part of the SEC's formal investigation, Cardinal Health received an SEC subpoena that included a request for the production of documents relating to revenue classification, and the methods used for such classification, in the company's Pharmaceutical Distribution business as either "Operating Revenues" or "Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other." In addition, the company learned that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York had also commenced an inquiry that the company understands relates to the revenue classification issue. Cardinal Health continues to respond to the investigations by providing all information required.

Exhibit 99.02 The Company incurred special items during the fourth quarter, consisting primarily of merger-related and restructuring charges of $33.1 million, a one-time, special contribution to The Cardinal Foundation of $31.7 million and costs related to the SEC investigation and Audit Committee internal review of $6.2 million. These costs were partially offset by income of $31.6 million received in conjunction with the settlement of litigation arising from antitrust claims alleging certain prescription drug manufacturers took improper actions to delay or prevent generic drug competition. Merger charges include such items as costs associated with exit and consolidation of facilities as well as costs of integrating acquired businesses. Restructuring charges primarily relate to decisions made by management to incur costs to realign components of its business operations to meet current business demands. The special contribution was executed as a direct result of litigation settlements received during the quarter. On a net basis, these special items totaled $39.4 million ($25.3 million after tax) versus $49.0 million ($33.3 million after tax) for the year-earlier period. In the opinion of management, these items, by their nature, rarely have predictable trends and are not truly reflective of ongoing operating results. Therefore, the Company presents its results on both a GAAP basis (GAAP) and a GAAP basis excluding these items ("adjusted"). Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the "adjusted" numbers as a supplemental metric to assist readers. It should be noted that the items being adjusted from the GAAP results represent actual income or expense to the Company. These items impact operating cash flow available to support on-going operations. As such, these items are an important component of the financial performance of the Company and any metric excluding them will present an incomplete picture. Nevertheless, management uses "adjusted" results to measure its performance, in addition to the GAAP results. As the Company's core business is providing health care products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use a metric that is free of charges and gains associated with restructuring, merger related activity and litigation. While these may be recurring items for the Company, management believes they are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and are related more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions that tend to mask the trends and financial performance of the Company's products and services. Management also believes that investors may also find an unmasked view of the Company's core operations to be useful.
