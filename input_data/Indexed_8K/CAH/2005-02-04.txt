(Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in its Charter) OHIO (State or Other Jurisdiction of Incorporation) 1-11373 31-0958666 (Commission File Number) (IRS Employer Identification Number) 7000 CARDINAL PLACE, DUBLIN, OHIO 43017 (Address of Principal Executive Offices, Including Zip Code) (614) 757-5000 (Registrant's Telephone Number, Including Area Code) Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below): [ ] Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) [ ] Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c))
ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION The information set forth under this "Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition" is intended to be furnished and such information, including the Exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. A copy of a press release announcing the Registrant's results for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.01. Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.02 is a discussion of the reasons why management believes that presenting results that exclude the impact of special charges provides a useful representation of the Registrant's current performance and trends. ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE ACCOUNTING INVESTIGATION UPDATE As more fully described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 (the "2004 Form 10-K"), in October 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") initiated an informal inquiry regarding Cardinal Health, Inc. (the "Company"). The SEC's request sought historical financial and related information including but not limited to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers. The SEC's request sought a variety of documentation, including the Company's accounting records for fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2003, as well as notes, memoranda, presentations, e-mail and other correspondence, budgets, forecasts and estimates. In connection with the SEC's informal inquiry, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company commenced its own internal review in April 2004, assisted by independent counsel. On May 6, 2004, the Company was notified that the SEC had converted the informal inquiry into a formal investigation. On June 21, 2004, as part of the SEC's formal investigation, the Company received an additional SEC subpoena that included a request for the production of documents relating to revenue classification, and the methods used for such classification, in the Company's Pharmaceutical Distribution business as either "Operating Revenue" or "Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other." In addition, the Company learned that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York had also commenced an inquiry with respect to the Company that the Company understands relates to the revenue classification issue. On October 12, 2004, in connection with the SEC's formal investigation, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting the production of documents relating to compensation information for specific current and former employees and officers. The Company continues to respond to the SEC's investigation and the Audit Committee's internal review and provide all information required. During September and October 2004, the Audit Committee reached certain conclusions with respect to findings from its internal review as of the date of the determination. These conclusions regarding certain items that impact revenue and earnings relate to four primary areas of focus: (1) classification of sales to customer warehouses between "Operating Revenue" and "Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other" within the Company's Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment; (2) disclosure of the Company's practice, in certain reporting periods, of accelerating its receipt and recognition of cash discounts earned from suppliers for prompt payment; (3) timing of revenue recognition within the Company's Automation and Information Services segment; and (4) certain balance sheet reserve and accrual adjustments that have been identified in the internal review. The Audit Committee's internal review with respect to the financial statement impact of the matters reviewed to date is substantially complete. In connection with these conclusions, the Audit Committee determined that the financial statements of the Company with respect to fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 as well as the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 should be restated to reflect the conclusions from its internal review to date. -2-
These restatements were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K. Following the conclusions reached by the Audit Committee in September and October 2004, the Audit Committee began the task of assigning responsibility for the financial statement matters described above which were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K and has determined to take disciplinary actions with respect to the Company's employees who it determined bore responsibility for these matters, other than with respect to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers for which there is an ongoing separate Board committee internal review (discussed below). The disciplinary actions ranged from terminations or resignations of employment to required repayments of some or all of fiscal 2003 bonuses from certain employees to letters of reprimand. These disciplinary actions affect senior financial and managerial personnel, as well as other personnel, at the corporate level and in four business segments. None of the Company's current corporate executive officers (who are identified at www.cardinal.com) were the subject of disciplinary action by the Audit Committee. All affected employees have been notified. In connection with the determinations made by the Audit Committee, Gary S. Jensen, the Company's controller, has resigned, which resignation will be effective on February 15, 2005. With the exception of conclusions concerning the responsibility for matters relating to the Company's accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamins manufacturers which are being addressed by a separate committee of the Board, the Audit Committee has completed its determinations of responsibility for the financial statement matters described above which were reflected in the 2004 Form 10-K. As the Company continues to respond to the SEC's investigation, the U.S. Attorney's inquiry and the Audit Committee's internal review, there can be no assurance that additional restatements will not be required, that the historical financial statements included in the 2004 Form 10-K, or the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004, will not change or require amendment, or that additional disciplinary actions would not be required in such circumstances. In addition, as the SEC's investigation, the U.S. Attorney's inquiry and the Audit Committee's internal review continue, the Audit Committee may identify new issues, or make additional findings if it receives additional information, that may impact the Company's financial statements and the scope of the restatements described in the 2004 Form 10-K and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004. In connection with the SEC's formal investigation, a committee of the Board of Directors, with the assistance of independent counsel, is separately conducting an internal review to assign responsibility for matters relating to the Company's accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers. In the 2004 Form 10-K, as part of the Audit Committee's internal review, the Company reversed its previous recognition of estimated recoveries from vitamin manufacturers for amounts overcharged in prior years and recognized the income from such recoveries as a special item in the period cash was received from the manufacturers. The SEC staff had previously advised the Company that, in its view, the Company did not have an appropriate basis for recognizing the income in advance of receiving the cash. The Company is responding to the separate committee internal review and providing all information required. The conclusions of the Audit Committee's internal review to date with respect to financial statement matters is set forth in Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2004 Form 10-K and additional information is set forth in Note 1 to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004. The SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry, the Audit Committee internal review and the separate committee internal review remain ongoing. While the Company is continuing in its efforts to respond to these inquiries and provide all information required, the Company cannot predict the outcome -3-
of the SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry, the Audit Committee internal review or the separate committee internal review. The outcome of the SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include the institution of administrative, civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving the Company and/or current or former Company employees, officers and/or directors, as well as the imposition of fines and other penalties, remedies and sanctions.

Exhibit 99.01 [Cardinal Health Logo] 7000 Cardinal Place Dublin, OH 43017 www.cardinal.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACTS: Media: Jim Mazzola Investors: Jim Hinrichs (614) 757-3690 (614) 757-7828 jim.hinrichs@cardinal.com jim.mazzola@cardinal.com CARDINAL HEALTH ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS, UPDATES FISCAL 2005 OUTLOOK AUDIT COMMITTEE REACHES RESPONSIBILITY CONCLUSIONS IN ACCOUNTING REVIEW DUBLIN, OHIO, FEB. 4, 2005 -- Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE: CAH), the leading provider of products and services supporting the health care industry, today announced revenue for its second quarter rose 13 percent to $18.6 billion, while earnings from continuing operations declined to $204 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined to $0.47. Results for the quarter and first half of fiscal 2005, ended Dec. 31, were in line with the company's previously revised guidance. Excluding special items of $71 million for the quarter, net earnings from continuing operations decreased 26 percent to $275 million compared to $370 million in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations before special items declined 25 percent to $0.63 versus $0.84 last year. These results include non-recurring charges for the quarter of $67 million or $0.10 per share. First-half revenues climbed 15 percent to $36.4 billion, while ongoing margin pressure caused net earnings from continuing operations to decline 40 percent to $422 million. Excluding special items, earnings from continuing operations declined 27 percent to $513 million. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.97, or $1.18 excluding special items. These results include non-recurring charges for the six months ended Dec. 31 of $107 million or $0.17 per share. "Our second-quarter performance, while below Cardinal Health's potential, was in line with our previously revised expectations and reflects steady progress in several key areas of the business, including the transition to non-contingent distribution contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers," said Robert D. Walter, chairman and chief executive officer. "We continued to experience earnings pressure as we manage this transition, which is not only important to Cardinal Health's business, but paramount to the efficiency of the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain. -more-
CARDINAL HEALTH ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS PAGE 2 "Cardinal Health's highly efficient distribution network has helped drive billions of dollars of cost out of the supply chain, resulting in savings for pharmacies and ultimately lower prices for consumers," Walter added. "We are committed to the transition and to our disciplined, fact-based approach in reaching new agreements with our manufacturer customers." AUDIT COMMITTEE REVIEW AND VITAMINS REVIEW Cardinal Health said that the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors had reached conclusions concerning its assignment of responsibility for certain financial statement matters discussed in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, resulting in disciplinary actions for certain employees. In addition, a separate committee of the Board of Directors, with the assistance of independent counsel, is separately conducting an internal review to assign responsibility for matters relating to Cardinal Health's accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers. (Additional information regarding the Audit Committee review and the separate vitamins review is included in the Form 8-K, filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission which can be found at the investor relations page of http://www.cardinalhealth.com). The Audit Committee review, the separate vitamins review, and the previously announced investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Attorney remain ongoing. SEGMENT AND OPERATIONAL RESULTS Operating earnings in each business segment improved from the first quarter, as Cardinal Health addressed key challenges and performance-improvement actions began to deliver results. The company also remains on schedule to improve its cost structure by $125 million during fiscal 2005 through a restructuring program initiated during the first quarter. Lower capital requirements in its pharmaceutical distribution business enabled Cardinal Health to generate strong cash flow from operations of $626 million during the quarter, including net proceeds of $300 million through an accounts-receivable securitization program. Free cash flow exceeded $500 million during the quarter, an increase of more than 200 percent from the prior period, and reached $1.3 billion for the year-to-date, which includes net proceeds of $800 million through an accounts-receivable securitization program. (See the attached financial table for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP amounts to their GAAP equivalents and a schedule of non-recurring items. Tables with specific segment results for the second quarter and fiscal year-to-date are also attached and available at the Investor Relations page on www.cardinalhealth.com.) PHARMACEUTICAL DISTRIBUTION AND PROVIDER SERVICES Revenues within the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment increased 15 percent for the quarter to $15.1 billion, while operating earnings declined by 9 percent to $213 million. The operating-earnings decline was primarily due to lower branded pharmaceutical buy margins, driven by lower price appreciation and available inventory compared to prior years. During the quarter, Cardinal Health continued its transition to non-contingent distribution-service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers, rather than agreements based on pharmaceutical price appreciation. Strong progress was made with a number of -MORE-
CARDINAL HEALTH ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS PAGE 3 manufacturers, including signing multi-year contracts with Eli Lilly and Company during the quarter and with Eisai Inc. in January. By April 1, the company expects to have completed contracts that will transition the majority of branded vendor margin to non-contingent compensation. This transition will drive improvements in the second half of fiscal 2005 and create stronger, more predictable earnings growth for fiscal 2006. Expense control measures continue to drive efficiency, with selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales declining from the prior year. In addition, efficiency and profitability within the segment will continue to be enhanced by the ramp up of Cardinal Health's National Logistics Center, which began operations during September 2004. MEDICAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES Revenue growth within Medical Products and Services increased 6 percent to $2.4 billion, with operating earnings equal to the second quarter of fiscal 2004 at $170 million. Sales of new products and recent hospital and group purchase organization (GPO) contract wins drove the revenue increase, while profitability continued to be affected by competitive pricing on a large GPO contract and rising costs of raw materials used in manufacturing. This pressure was partially offset by strong sales of Cardinal Health surgeon gloves, efficiency programs and profitable international performance. In addition, growth in specialty surgical instruments and sales of private label products contributed to operating earnings in the period. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were below prior year levels, the result of ongoing efficiency actions. Continued emphasis on new products, operating efficiencies and implementation of new contracts are expected to improve Medical Products and Services earnings during the second half of the fiscal year. PHARMACEUTICAL TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services revenues increased 7 percent during the quarter to $760 million, driven by sales growth in oral technologies, nuclear pharmacy services and the year-over-year benefit of the Intercare acquisition, completed in December 2003. However, operating earnings declined 22 percent to $89 million for the quarter, primarily related to sterile-manufacturing costs associated with delays in opening new facilities and from existing facilities operating below their planned capacity. This weakness was partially offset by an increase in demand for softgel products, including Abbott's protease inhibitor Kaletra(R). Operating earnings for the period were not materially affected by acquisitions. The company also continued to expand its relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers during the quarter and said it now provides pharmaceutical development, manufacturing, packaging or marketing services for nearly 170 of the top 200 drugs worldwide. Operating-earnings improvements during the second half of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 will be driven by increases in production at Cardinal Health's Albuquerque, N.M. and other sterile manufacturing facilities, and from restructuring benefits. New product opportunities in blow/fill/seal sterile manufacturing are also expected to contribute to earnings growth in 2006. -more-
CARDINAL HEALTH ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS PAGE 4 In addition, Cardinal Health has signed a letter of intent with VaxGen, Inc. to fill, finish and package a recombinant anthrax vaccine. The companies plan to have a full supply agreement in place by the end of June 2005, which is subject to the approval of the U.S. government. Cardinal Health expects the agreement would result in revenues of $100 million to $150 million over the two-year period ending December 2007. CLINICAL TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES (Results for this segment, which include Cardinal Health's Alaris(R) products, Pyxis(R) products and Clinical Services and Consulting organizations, are being reported for the first time this fiscal year. Prior-year results used in comparisons have been adjusted to include Pyxis and Clinical Services and Consulting, but not Alaris, which was acquired by Cardinal Health in July 2004.) Revenues for the Clinical Technologies and Services segment increased 38 percent to $547 million for the quarter, while operating earnings decreased 21 percent to $76 million. Excluding Alaris products, revenues declined 4 percent and operating earnings declined 51 percent. Strong revenues and operating earnings for Alaris products were offset by year-over-year revenue and operating-earnings declines for Pyxis products. Pyxis sales growth was dampened by the delayed introduction of Pyxis MedSystem. This new product and service offering, which includes Pyxis MedStation(R) 3000, the next generation of Cardinal Health's market-leading medication management system for the nurses' station, was launched in December and is now being well-received by customers. In addition, Pyxis results were negatively affected by execution issues related to system installations. Revenue backlog from committed contracts ended the quarter at $206 million. Over the long-term, growth in the segment will be driven by innovative product and service offerings that draw on the vast clinical resources assembled in this organization, the company said. In addition to Pyxis MedSystem, new products introduced during the quarter included the Alaris(R) Patient-Controlled Analgesia Module, Alaris(R) EtCO(2) Module and upgrades to the Guardrails(R) Suite of safety software, all enhancements to the market-leading Alaris Medication Management System designed for the patient's bedside. Clinical Technologies and Services results are expected to improve during the year as customers adopt these new products and the company gains additional efficiencies from the formation of the segment. Significant progress was made during the quarter to improve efficiency, including implementation of lean manufacturing processes and a restructuring of customer support operations. In addition, the integration of Alaris with Cardinal Health is still expected to achieve synergies of $80 million to $100 million on a pre-tax basis by the end of fiscal 2007. OUTLOOK Cardinal Health expects earnings per share for fiscal 2005 to be $3.20 to $3.40, excluding special items and non-recurring charges. Earnings expectations have been reduced from prior guidance to reflect uncertainty about branded pharmaceutical price increases, available inventory and the short-term impact of the transition to fee-based distribution service agreements in its Pharmaceutical Distribution business. -MORE-
CARDINAL HEALTH ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS PAGE 5 The new guidance also reflects the potential for continued delays in the installation of Pyxis committed contracts as a result of organizational re-staffing. For fiscal 2005, free cash flow is expected to be approximately $2 billion, including $800 million from an accounts-receivable securitization program. The company expects to enter fiscal 2006, beginning July 1, 2005, with strong momentum. Earnings are expected to grow at a rate considerably above its long-term growth goal of mid-teens or better, excluding special items and non-recurring charges. The guidance is based on Cardinal Health's confidence in signing agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers during fiscal 2005 that will result in the substantial majority of vendor margins for fiscal 2006 being converted to non-contingent compensation. The fiscal 2006 guidance is further based on the company's confidence for substantial improvement in Pyxis sales and installation capability, continued strong demand and significant improvement in manufacturing efficiency for sterile product and overall continued strong performance in its other businesses. Cash flow for the year is expected to grow in-line with earnings growth. George Fotiades, Cardinal Health President and COO, said "We are making progress on our most important operating issues identified for fiscal year 2005, as evidenced by our sequential improvement in operating earnings growth for all four of our segments. However, the pace of that progress has been slower than we originally expected. We believe that the second half of the fiscal year will show continued improvement and we are optimistic about the momentum that we expect to have as we enter our 2006 fiscal year."

CARDINAL HEALTH INC. - RECONCILIATION OF NON-RECURRING CHARGES ($ MILLIONS) - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ###

Exhibit 99.02 The Company incurred special items during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 consisting primarily of restructuring charges of $105.1 million, merger-related charges of $10.2 million and costs related to the SEC investigation and Audit Committee internal review of $9.0 million. These costs were partially offset by income of $21.2 million received in conjunction with the settlement of litigation arising from antitrust claims alleging certain prescription drug manufacturers took improper actions to delay or prevent generic drug competition. Restructuring charges primarily relate to the previously announced global restructuring program. The costs incurred to date under the global restructuring program primarily consist of employee-related costs, asset impairments and facility exit costs. Merger-related charges include such items as employee-related costs and costs associated with exit and consolidation of facilities, as well as costs of integrating acquired businesses. Costs related to the SEC investigation and Audit Committee internal review primarily include legal fees and document preservation and production costs. On an after-tax basis, the special items incurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 totaled $71.1 million versus income of $3.3 million for the year-earlier period. In the opinion of management, these special items, by their nature, rarely have predictable trends and are not truly reflective of ongoing operating results. Therefore, the Company presents its results on both a GAAP basis ("GAAP") and a GAAP basis excluding these special items ("adjusted"). Management uses adjusted results to measure its performance in addition to the GAAP results. As the Company's core business is providing health care products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use a metric that does not include charges and gains associated with restructuring, merger-related activity and litigation. While these special items may be recurring items for the Company, management believes they are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions that tend to mask the trends and financial performance of the Company's products and services. Management also believes that investors may also find an unmasked view of the Company's core operations to be useful. In addition, the Company has identified certain items that are either infrequent or will aid the reader in analyzing comparability between prior periods. These items include asset impairment charges, net of minority interest and foreign currency translation adjustments, of $63.6 million and a $3.4 million charge incurred by the Company's Clinical Technologies and Services segment as a result of a purchase-accounting inventory adjustment associated with the acquisition of ALARIS Medical Systems, Inc. The Company provided information regarding the impact of each of these items on its consolidated results. The Company believes this information is useful for investors' assessment of the operating trends of the Company's businesses. Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the GAAP amounts that have been adjusted as a supplemental metric to assist readers. It should be noted that the items being adjusted from the GAAP results represent actual income or expense to the Company. These items impact operating cash flow available to support on-going operations. As such, these items are an important component of the financial performance of the Company and any metric excluding them will present an incomplete picture.
