FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
www.cardinal.com
 Cardinal Health, Inc. (NYSE: CAH), the leading provider of products and services supporting the health-care industry, today updated its long-term and fiscal 2006 earnings-per-share outlook and announced plans to return nearly $1.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and the doubling of its dividend.
DUBLIN, Ohio, June 27, 2005
The company also said earnings per share excluding special items and non-recurring charges for the current fiscal year, ending June 30, would reach the upper half of the $3.10 to $3.20 range it previously announced. (See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for more information about earnings per share excluding special items and non-recurring charges, which is a non-GAAP measure.)
Over the long term, Cardinal Health expects earnings per share excluding special items and non-recurring charges to grow 12 percent to 15 percent annually with an annual goal of returning 50 percent of operating cash flow to shareholders through share buy-backs and dividends. During the next several years, the company's goal is to increase dividends to up to 20 percent of earnings per share, from the less than 4-percent rate paid in the current fiscal year-to-date.
For fiscal 2006 that begins July 1, earnings per share excluding special items and non-recurring charges are expected to be $3.30 to $3.55 as Cardinal Health increases investments to support future growth and manages ongoing transitions in certain businesses.
The company's board of directors has approved a $1 billion share repurchase program and the initial dividend increase to 6-cents-per-share for the current quarter. The dividend is payable on July 15 to shareholders of record as of July 1. Based on this rate, the company expects fiscal 2006 dividends to total $0.24 per share, a doubling of the company's previous annual dividend policy of $0.12 per share. Cardinal Health has paid a 3-cent-per-share quarterly dividend since July 15, 2003, and had previously announced a 3-cent-per-share

dividend for the current quarter. Future dividends are subject to approval by Cardinal Health's board.
"Cardinal Health will continue to focus during fiscal 2006 on the substantial opportunities for organic growth in our core businesses," said Robert D. Walter, chairman and chief executive officer. "We have set priorities for the investments necessary to better serve our health-care customers, and we believe our revised EPS outlook reflects the proper balance of short-term profitability goals and sustaining long-term leadership. Our long-term confidence is evident in the goals we've set to increase share repurchases and raise dividends over the next several years."
During fiscal 2006, the company plans to increase investments in the research and development of new products in all segments, particularly in Clinical Technologies and Services, and make infrastructure improvements to enhance efficiency and customer service. These investments are expected to increase Cardinal Health's long-term competitive position and add to profitability, substantially beginning in fiscal 2007. Strong cash flow from operations, combined with lower working capital requirements is expected to create the cash necessary to fund increased dividends and the repurchase of shares.
Cardinal Health said results for fiscal 2006 are expected to be lower than its long-term expectations due to the investments it will make during the year, branded pharmaceutical vendor margins below long-term expectations and the ongoing transitions in its Pyxis products and sterile-manufacturing businesses.

Earnings per share excluding special items and non-recurring charges is a non-GAAP financial measure.
