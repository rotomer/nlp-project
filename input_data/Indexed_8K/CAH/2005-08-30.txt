Portions of this Current Report on
Form 8-K/A
of Cardinal Health, Inc. (the "Company") include "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied. The most significant of these risks, uncertainties and other factors are described in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 (including in the section titled "Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results" within "Item 1: Business") and in Exhibit 99.01 to the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2004 and include (but are not limited to) the following: the results, consequences, effects or timing of any inquiry or investigation by any regulatory authority or any legal and administrative proceedings; the impact of previously announced restatements; the inability to reach a successful resolution of current discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or such resolution being delayed; and general economic, regulatory and market conditions. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement.
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     This Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on August 5, 2005 (the "August 5 Form 8-K"). In the August 5 Form 8-K, the Company furnished a press release issued on August 5, 2005, announcing financial results for the Company's quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 (the "August 5 Press Release"). Subsequent to the issuance of the August 5 Press Release and the filing of the August 5 Form 8-K, the Company determined that the following items within its Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment relate to conditions that existed as of June 30, 2005 and, therefore, require adjustment to the previously announced fiscal 2005 results:
     The net impact of the above adjustments was to reduce diluted earnings per Common Share from continuing operations excluding special items by $0.01 for the quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2005.
 
     In addition, as discussed more fully below, settlement discussions have recently commenced with the SEC regarding a possible resolution of its investigation with respect to the Company. As a result of the initiation of these discussions, the Company recorded a reserve of $25 million for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, in respect of the SEC investigation. The reserve is classified as a "special item" in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2005.
     The following tables summarize the impact of the above noted adjustments on the information previously reported in the August 5 Press Release. The percentage shown in the table reflects the percentage increase or decrease compared to the results for the comparable period in fiscal 2004 as reported in the August 5 Press Release and as set forth in the financial tables furnished under this Form 8-K/A as Exhibit 99.01. The financial tables also contain a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this Form 8-K/A to their comparable GAAP measures.
(in millions, except per Common Share amounts)
(in millions, except per Common Share amounts)
 
     As previously reported and described in more detail in its most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company has been responding to a formal investigation by the SEC in which the SEC has sought historical financial and related information about the Company, including but not limited to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers, accounting records for fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2003, revenue classification in the Company's Pharmaceutical Distribution business, and compensation information for specific current and former employees and officers. The SEC had initially commenced an informal inquiry in October 2003. In addition, also as previously reported, the Company learned that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York had commenced an inquiry with respect to the Company that the Company understands relates to the revenue classification issue.
     In connection with the SEC informal inquiry, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company commenced its own internal review in April 2004, assisted by independent counsel. As a result of certain conclusions reached with respect to this review, in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2004, the Company restated its financial statements with respect to fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 as well as the first three quarters of fiscal 2004. These conclusions are detailed in the Company's Form 10-K for fiscal 2004. As part of its internal review, the Audit Committee assigned responsibility for the financial statement matters that were the subject of the restatements in the Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 and has taken disciplinary actions with respect to the Company's employees who it determined bore responsibility for these matters, other than with respect to the accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers for which there is an ongoing separate Board committee internal review (discussed below). The Audit Committee's internal review with respect to the financial statement impact of the matters that were the subject of the restatements in the Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 is substantially complete.
     In addition, in connection with the SEC's formal investigation, a separate committee of the Board of Directors, with the assistance of independent counsel, is conducting an internal review to assign responsibility for matters relating to the Company's accounting treatment of certain recoveries from vitamin manufacturers. In August 2005, the separate Board committee reached certain conclusions with respect to findings from its internal review and determined that no additional disciplinary actions were required. The separate Board committee internal review is substantially complete.
     Settlement discussions have recently commenced with the SEC regarding a possible resolution of its investigation with respect to the Company. While these discussions are ongoing, there can be no assurance that the Company's efforts to resolve the investigation with respect to the Company will be successful, and the Company cannot predict the timing or outcome of these matters or the terms of any such resolution. As a result of the initiation of these discussions, the Company recorded a reserve of $25 million for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, in respect of the SEC investigation. Unless and until the SEC investigation is resolved, there can be no assurance that the amount reserved by the Company for this investigation will be sufficient and that a larger amount will not be required. Therefore, this reserve will be reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted to the extent that the Company determines it is necessary.
     The SEC investigation and the U.S. Attorney inquiry remain ongoing. While the Company is continuing to respond to these inquiries and provide all information required, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the SEC investigation or the U.S. Attorney inquiry, and there can be no assurance that additional restatements will not be required or that prior restatements will not change or require amendment. The outcome of the SEC investigation, the U.S. Attorney inquiry and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include the institution of administrative, civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving the Company and/or current or former employees, officers and/or directors, as well as the imposition of fines and other penalties, remedies and sanctions.
 
     Replacement financial tables for the tables included as part of the August 5 Press Release, updated to reflect the matters described in this Form 8-K/A, are furnished under this Form 8-K/A as Exhibit 99.01. Also furnished under this Form 8-K/A as Exhibit 99.02 is a discussion of the reasons why management believes that presenting results that exclude the impact of special charges provides a useful representation of the Company's current performance and trends, as updated to reflect the matters described in this Form 8-K/A.

Exhibit 99.02
     Cardinal Health, Inc. (the "Company") incurred special items during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 consisting primarily of restructuring charges of $64.6 million, merger-related charges of $11.4 million and costs related to the Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC") investigation and Audit Committee internal review of $31.0 million. The costs were partially offset by income of $21.1 million received in conjunction with the settlement of litigation arising from antitrust claims alleging certain prescription drug manufacturers took improper actions to delay or prevent generic drug competition. Restructuring charges primarily relate to the previously announced global restructuring program. The costs incurred to date under the global restructuring program primarily consist of employee-related costs, asset impairments and facility exit costs. Merger-related charges include such items as employee-related costs and costs associated with exit and consolidation of facilities, as well as costs of integrating acquired businesses. Costs related to the SEC investigation and Audit Committee internal review primarily include legal fees and document preservation and production costs. On an after-tax basis, the special items incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 totaled $76.7 million compared to $25.3 million for the year-earlier period. In the opinion of management, these special items, by their nature, rarely have predictable trends and are not truly reflective of ongoing operating results. Therefore, the Company presents its results on both a basis using generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and a basis excluding these special items.
     Management uses the basis excluding these special items to measure its performance in addition to the GAAP results. As the Company's core business is providing health care products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use a metric that does not include charges and gains associated with restructuring, merger-related activity and litigation. While these special items may be recurring items for the Company, management believes they are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate to more strategic, multi-year corporate actions that tend to mask the trends and financial performance of the Company's products and services. Management also believes that investors may also find an unmasked view of the Company's core operations to be useful.
     In addition, the Company has identified certain items that are either infrequent or will aid the reader in analyzing comparability between prior periods. These items include asset impairment charges and losses on sale of fixed assets of $15.0 million, an inventory write-off adjustment of $0.6 million related to an SKU rationalization project within the Company's Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment, an $11.8 million latex receivable write-off within the Company's Medical Products and Services segment, and a $26.3 million charge related to the Homeland Investment Act repatriation tax provision. The Company provided information regarding the impact of each of these items on its consolidated results. The Company believes this information is useful for investors' assessment of the operating trends of the Company's businesses.
     Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the amounts that have been adjusted as a supplemental metric to assist readers. It should be noted that the items being adjusted from the GAAP results represent actual income or expense to the Company. These items impact operating cash flow available to support on-going operations. As such, these items are an important component of the financial performance of the Company and any metric excluding them will present an incomplete picture.
