Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     The information set forth under this "Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition" is intended to be furnished and such information, including Exhibit 99.01 furnished under this report, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
     On October 19, 2005, the Company released certain historical financial information for its reportable segments that has been adjusted to reflect a change in the Company's methodology for allocating corporate costs to its reportable segments. This change in methodology will more fully allocate corporate costs and better align corporate spending with the reportable segments receiving the related benefit. The historical financial information also was adjusted to reflect the determination during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 to classify the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment's Humacao, Puerto Rico operations as discontinued operations. Further information regarding these adjustments will be included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 and subsequent reports, including adjusted historical segment information. The adjusted information is furnished under this report as Exhibit 99.01.
