Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     The information set forth under this "Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition" is intended to be furnished and such information, including the exhibits furnished under this report, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
     On January 26, 2006, Cardinal Health, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its results for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished under this report as Exhibit 99.01.
     Furnished under this report as Exhibit 99.02 is a discussion of the reasons why management believes that presenting results that exclude the impact of special items and equity compensation expense provides a useful representation of the Company's current performance and trends.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure
     During a conference call scheduled to be held at 11:00 a.m. EST on January 26, 2006, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Jeffrey W. Henderson, will discuss the Company's results for the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2005. The Company is furnishing Mr. Henderson's slide presentation for the conference call as Exhibit 99.03 to this report.
     As previously disclosed, the Company continues to engage in settlement discussions with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and has now reached an agreement-in-principle on the basic terms of a potential settlement involving the Company that the SEC staff has indicated it is prepared to recommend to the Commission. The proposed settlement is subject to the completion of definitive documentation as well as acceptance and authorization by the Commission and would, among other things, require the Company to pay a $35 million penalty. The Company accordingly recorded a reserve of $10 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2005 in addition to the $25 million reserve recorded for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. There can be no assurance that the Company's efforts to resolve the SEC's investigation with respect to the Company will be successful, or that the amount reserved will be sufficient, and the Company cannot predict the timing or the final terms of any settlement.

 Cardinal Health, Inc., the leading provider of products and services supporting the health-care industry, announced today that earnings per share strengthened during its second quarter, rising 46 percent from the prior year, as the company continued to make operational improvements and invest for future growth.
DUBLIN, Ohio, Jan. 26, 2006
Revenue for the quarter-ended Dec. 31 rose 7 percent to $19.9 billion from $18.5 billion in the prior year and operating earnings grew 48 percent to $484 million from $326 million. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 46 percent to $0.70 from $0.48.
"We remain focused on improving key fundamentals of our business and making operational improvements that resulted in a solid quarter across the company," said Robert D. Walter, chairman and chief executive officer of Cardinal Health.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 14 percent during the quarter, 8 percentage points of which related to equity compensation. Commenting on the SG&A increase, Walter said, "Reflected in these financials are expenditures we are making to streamline operations, build scale and develop new capabilities, which will ultimately lower costs across the business. Fiscal 2006 remains a building year as we make these investments and take the necessary steps to integrate our businesses for future growth."
Special items of $21 million for the quarter include a $10 million reserve related to Cardinal Health's ongoing settlement discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), raising its total reserve for the matter to $35 million. As previously disclosed, the company continues to engage in settlement discussions with the staff of the SEC and has now reached an agreement-in-principle on the basic terms of a potential settlement involving the company that the SEC staff has indicated it is prepared to recommend to the Commission. The proposed settlement is subject to the completion of definitive documentation as well as acceptance and authorization by the Commission and would, among other things, require Cardinal Health to pay a $35 million penalty. There can be no assurance that efforts to resolve the SEC's investigation with respect to the company will be successful, or that the amount reserved will be sufficient, and Cardinal Health cannot predict the timing or the final terms of any settlement.
Cash flow from operations remained strong during the quarter, reaching $661 million. As part of its goal to return up to 50 percent of operating cash flow to shareholders, the company began to repurchase shares under a $1 billion buy-back program announced in June 2005. Through this authorization, Cardinal Health has spent $586 million to purchase nearly 8.8 million shares to date in January, and expects to complete the program by the end of the fiscal year. Return on equity increased to 13.8 percent from 10 percent in the prior year. Excluding special items and equity compensation, return on equity increased 280 basis points to 16.2 percent compared to the second quarter last year.
Year-to-Date Results
Revenues for the first half of the year climbed 8 percent to $39.3 billion and operating earnings improved 24 percent to $857 million. Earnings from continuing operations rose 25 percent to $539 million, or $570 million excluding special items. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.25, or $1.32 excluding special items compared to $0.99 or $1.20 excluding special items for the prior period.

Second-Quarter Highlights
Segment Results
Customer demand continued to be strong across all four operating segments with year-over-year revenue increases in each. A focus on margin expansion has led to a company-wide increase in operating margin, with margins in each segment increasing or remaining stable from the first quarter.
(See attached tables or the Investors page on for specific segment results, definitions of the non-GAAP measures used in this release, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures, and a schedule of notable items.)

Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services
Revenue for the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment grew 8 percent during the quarter to $16.2 billion, including $7.1 billion in bulk sales compared to $5.8 billion last year. Operating earnings rose 16 percent to $240 million. Distribution service agreements with branded manufacturers reduced buy-margin volatility from the prior year, and combined with ongoing expense controls, were the primary contributor to earnings growth. In addition, a LIFO accounting credit lowered the cost of goods sold by $13 million for the period.
Cardinal Health continued to develop differentiated customer offerings during the quarter, including the launch of unit-dose barcode packaging for hospitals and Medicare Part D education programs for retail pharmacies. The company's National Logistics Center, which provides a value-added service for pharmaceutical manufacturers, remains ahead of company utilization projections.

Medical Products and Services
Medical Products and Services revenue increased 7 percent during the quarter to $2.6 billion on strong distribution sales and growth in Cardinal Health manufactured gloves and respiratory products. Operating earnings declined 1 percent from the prior year to $153 million, and were negatively affected by approximately 7 percentage points due to the allocation of increased corporate spending to the segment.
New business from the company's recently awarded contract with the Department of Veteran Affairs and strength in laboratory sales contributed to a strong quarter for the medical distribution business. Cardinal Health also acquired the remaining interest in Canadian distributor Source Medical, which contributed to continued growth in markets outside the United States.
Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services
Revenue for the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment reached $760 million, an increase of 1 percent from the prior year. Operating earnings declined 5 percent from the prior year to $79 million, and were negatively affected by nearly 7 percentage points due to the allocation of increased corporate spending to the segment.
Sequentially, operating earnings improved 75 percent from the first quarter, due to significant progress made to address operational issues within sterile manufacturing and a strong quarter for oral technologies. This increase also includes a lump-sum payment from an ongoing customer for commitments through the current period and for the cancellation of a future commitment.
An upgrade of the company's Albuquerque sterile-manufacturing facility that was completed last quarter resulted in a doubling of production at the site. Segment revenue and earnings growth were partially dampened by margin pressure and slower market growth in the company's nuclear pharmacy services business and ongoing industry changes within the health care marketing services business.
Clinical Technologies and Services
Results for the Clinical Technologies and Services segment continued to exceed Cardinal Health's goals, with revenue during the quarter rising 10 percent to $603 million and operating earnings growing 34 percent to $94 million.
Combined, revenue for Alaris and Pyxis products increased 14 percent during the quarter, and revenue from Cardinal Health's hospital consulting business grew 8 percent. With strong demand for both Alaris and Pyxis products and continued operating improvements in the segment, efficiency increased sharply from the first quarter resulting in an operating-margin improvement of nearly 200 basis points. Ongoing integration synergies from the Alaris acquisition and formation of the segment also contributed to this increase. Committed contracts again exceeded internal projections for both Alaris and Pyxis products, with the Pyxis backlog ending the quarter at $242 million.
Outlook
Cardinal Health reiterated its fiscal 2006 earnings-per-share outlook of $3.30 to $3.55, excluding special items, non-recurring and other items and the impact of equity

compensation expenses. The company expects full-year equity compensation expenses to be approximately $0.32 to $0.34 per share.
During the third and fourth quarters, Cardinal Health expects ongoing operational excellence programs to further expand margins sequentially and improve its cost structure while the company continues to build capabilities and invests in key integration projects.
Over the long term, earnings per share excluding special items and non-recurring items are expected to grow 12 percent to 15 percent annually with an annual goal of returning up to 50 percent of operating cash flow to shareholders through share buy-backs and dividends. Return on equity excluding special items and the impact of equity compensation expenses is expected to be in the range of 15 percent to 20 percent. It is also the company's goal to increase dividends to up to 20 percent of earnings per share during the next several years.

Exhibit 99.02
     Cardinal Health, Inc. (the "Company") incurred special items during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 consisting primarily of restructuring charges of $14.4 million, merger-related charges of $7.5 million and costs related to the Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC") investigation and Audit Committee internal review and related matters of $12.5 million. The costs were partially offset by income of $13.4 million received in conjunction with the settlement of litigation arising from antitrust claims alleging certain prescription drug manufacturers took improper actions to delay or prevent generic drug competition. Restructuring charges primarily relate to the previously announced global restructuring program in connection with the Company's One Cardinal Health initiative. The costs incurred to date under the global restructuring program primarily consist of employee-related costs, asset impairments and facility exit costs. Merger-related charges include such items as employee-related costs and costs associated with exit and consolidation of facilities, as well as costs of integrating acquired businesses. Costs related to the SEC investigation and Audit Committee internal review and related matters primarily include a settlement reserve, legal fees and document preservation and production costs. On an after-tax basis, the special items incurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 totaled $17.0 million compared to $71.1 million for the year-earlier period. In the opinion of management, these special items, by their nature, rarely have predictable trends and are not truly reflective of ongoing operating results. Therefore, the Company presents its results on both a basis using generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and a basis excluding these special items.
     Management uses the basis excluding these special items to measure its performance in addition to the GAAP results. As the Company's core business is providing health care products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use a metric that does not include charges and gains associated with restructuring, merger-related activity and litigation. While these special items may be recurring items for the Company, management believes they are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate to more strategic, multi-year corporate actions that tend to mask the trends and financial performance of the Company's products and services. Management also believes that investors may also find an unmasked view of the Company's core operations to be useful.
     In addition, the Company presented certain items as non-recurring or significant in nature. The Company believes the presentation of these items is useful for investors to assess the operating results and trends. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, these items include asset impairment charges and losses on sale of fixed assets of $5.1 million and income of $3.5 million to reconcile the performance terms of contracts for a limited number of vendors with credits erroneously not processed and recorded during prior periods. On an after-tax basis, the net impact totaled $1.1 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2006.
     The Company also presented certain financial metrics excluding the impact of equity compensation expense. The presentation of these metrics excluding the impact of equity compensation expense aids the reader to understand comparability between periods and operating trends. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, equity compensation expense totaled $55.8 million, or $35.9 million after-tax, compared to $2.8 million, or $1.8 million after-tax, for the year-earlier period.
     Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the amounts that have been adjusted as a supplemental metric to assist readers. It should be noted that the items being adjusted from the GAAP results represent actual income or expense to the Company. These items impact operating cash flow available to support on-going operations. As such, these items are an important component of the financial performance of the Company and any metric excluding them will present an incomplete picture.
