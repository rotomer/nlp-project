Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
Agreement Regarding Termination of Employment between the Company and Ronald Labrum
     On May 29, 2006, the Company and Ronald Labrum entered into a letter agreement (the "Letter Agreement"), a copy of which is filed with this Report as Exhibit 10.01. The Letter Agreement provides, among other matters, that Mr. Labrum will cease to be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Healthcare Supply Chain Services on July 31, 2006 and will cease to be an employee of the Company on September 22, 2006 (or at his election, another date between July 31, 2006 and September 22, 2006). Mr. Labrum's termination of employment will be treated as "without cause" under Mr. Labrum's Employment Agreement, dated November 5, 2003, as amended (the "Employment Agreement"); therefore, he will be entitled to receive (a) two times the sum of his annual base salary (currently $650,000 per year) plus his annual target bonus (currently 115% of his annual base salary) to be paid over 24 months after his termination, and (b) other benefits available to employees, including equity compensation awards, that have vested as of the date his employment with the Company terminates.
