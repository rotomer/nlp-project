Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Cardinal Health, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Purchase Agreement dated September 28, 2006 (the "Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which it agreed to sell $350 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2009 (the "2009 Notes") and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.80% notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes" and together with the 2009 notes, the "Notes") to the initial purchasers named in the Purchase Agreement (the "Initial Purchasers").
The closing of the sale of the Notes occurred on October 3, 2006. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discount and the estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, are estimated to be approximately $844.3 million. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Company offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Company relied on these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement.
The Notes are governed by an Indenture dated as of April 18, 1997 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., (successor to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, successor to Bank One, N.A., formerly known as Bank One, Columbus, N.A.), as trustee, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated October 3, 2006 (the "Indenture").
The 2009 Notes mature on October 2, 2009 and interest on the 2009 Notes will accrue at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 0.27% payable quarterly in arrears on January 2, April 2, July 2 and October 2, commencing January 2, 2007. The 2016 Notes mature on October 15, 2016 and interest on the 2016 Notes will accrue at 5.80% per year payable on April 15 and October 15, commencing April 15, 2007.
The Company may redeem the 2016 Notes prior to maturity, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or the sum of present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at an adjusted treasury rate plus 20 basis points, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the amount being redeemed to the date of redemption. The 2009 Notes are not redeemable.
The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay $500 million of the Company's preferred debt securities, $127.4 million of 7.30% notes due 2006 issued by a subsidiary and guaranteed by the Company, $53.1 million outstanding under a short-tem credit facility of a subsidiary guaranteed by the Company and for general corporate purposes.
In connection with the sale of the Notes, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, dated October 3, 2006, with the Initial Purchasers. Under the registration rights agreement, the Company agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to file and cause to become effective a registration statement with respect to an exchange of the Notes within 240 days of the issuance of the Notes. The Company also agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to complete the exchange offer for the Notes within 270 days of the issuance of the Notes. The Company also agreed to file a shelf registration statement relating to the resale of the Notes if the exchange offer is not consummated within the time period set forth in the previous sentence and under other circumstances specified in the registration rights agreement.
The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
On October 3, 2006, the Company sold $350 million aggregate principal amount of 2009 Notes and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2016 Notes to the Initial Purchasers in a private placement in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Company relied on these exemptions based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement.
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with all of the Company's existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to all of the Company's existing and future subordinated debt. The Notes are effectively subordinated to the liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries, including trade payables. The Notes also effectively rank junior in right of payment to any secured debt of the Company to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt.
The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful.
The information provided in Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.

(g) The Company will not, and will cause its affiliates not to, make any offer or sale of securities of the Company of any class if, as a result of the doctrine of "integration" referred to in Rule 502, such offer or sale would render invalid (for the purpose of (i) the sale of the Securities by the Company to the Initial Purchasers, (ii) the resale of the Securities by the Initial Purchasers to Subsequent Purchasers or (iii) the resale of the Securities by such Subsequent Purchasers to others) the exemption from the registration requirements of the Act provided by Section 4(2) thereof or by Rule 144A or by Regulation S thereunder or otherwise.

(vii) the Registration Rights Agreement has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and, assuming due execution and delivery by the Representatives, is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws relating to or affecting enforcement of the rights and remedies of creditors or by general principles of equity and, except further, as enforcement of rights to indemnification and contribution contained therein may be limited by applicable U.S. federal or state laws or the public policy underlying such laws;

In rendering the opinion set forth above, Baker & Hostetler LLP may (A) assume that New York law is substantially similar to Ohio law with respect to the opinions delivered in subsections (vi), (vii), (viii) and (ix) concerning the valid and binding nature of the obligations of the Indenture and the Securities; (B) assume the genuineness without independent investigation, of all signatures on all documents examined by such firm, the
 
conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to such firm as certified or facsimile copies and the authenticity of all such documents; and (C) rely as to matters of law of any State other than Ohio upon the opinion of counsel licensed to practice in such state and satisfactory to the Representatives (provided that such opinion shall state that the Representatives and Baker & Hostetler LLP are entitled to so rely) and as to certain matters of fact, upon certificates and written statements of officers and employees of, and accountants for, the Company.
Such counsel shall have also furnished to the Representatives a written statement dated the Closing Date to the effect that, based upon their participation in the preparation of the Time of Sale Information and the Final Offering Memorandum and any amendments and supplements thereto and upon their review and discussion of the contents thereof, but without independent check or verification except as specified, nothing has come to such counsel's attention which would lead them to believe that the Time of Sale Information contained any untrue statement of any material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Final Offering Memorandum (as amended or supplemented, if applicable) as of its date or the Closing Date contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Such counsel may state that, in rendering the opinion in (xii) above and the written statement referred to in the preceding sentence, they are not expressing any opinion on the financial statements and financial exhibits and other financial data included therein or omitted therefrom and that they are not responsible for the adequacy or accuracy of the derivation or compilation from the Company's accounting records of the financial data included in the Time of Sale Information or the Final Offering Memorandum and any amendments and supplements thereto.
(b) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives the opinion of John M. Adams, Associate General Counsel of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that there are no legal or governmental proceedings known to such counsel pending or threatened required to be described in the Time of Sale Information or the Final Offering Memorandum which are not described as required, and there is no contract or document known to such counsel of a character required to be described in the Time of Sale Information or the Final Offering Memorandum. Such counsel shall have also furnished to the Representatives a written statement dated the Closing Date to the same effect as that set forth in the last paragraph of the preceding clause (a).
(c) The Representatives shall have received from Shearman & Sterling LLP, counsel for the Initial Purchasers, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Indenture, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Time of Sale Information, the Final Offering Memorandum and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they reasonably request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
 
(d) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company signed by the Chairman of the Board, the President or any Vice President of the Company dated the Closing Date, to the effect that:
(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date;
(ii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included in the Time of Sale Information and the Final Offering Memorandum, there has been no material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, business, properties or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Time of Sale Information and the Final Offering Memorandum.
(e) At the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives letters (which, with respect to any letter delivered on the Closing Date, may refer to letters previously delivered to the Representatives, a copy of which shall be attached, in which case the letter provided at the Closing Date shall state that the previous letter can be relied on), dated respectively as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, containing statements and information of the type ordinarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to initial purchasers with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained in or incorporated by reference in the Time of Sale Information and the Final Offering Memorandum.
(f) Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Time of Sale Information (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and the Final Offering Memorandum (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and prior to the Closing Date, there shall not have been any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the business, properties or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, the effect of which is, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Time of Sale Information and the Final Offering Memorandum.
(g) Subsequent to the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, there shall not have been any downgrading in the ratings of any of the Company's debt securities, by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act or any public announcement by any such organization that it has under surveillance or review with negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities (or proposed rating of the Securities).
 
(h) The Company shall have entered into the Registration Rights Agreement and the Initial Purchasers shall have received executed counterparts thereof.
(i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request.
If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not have been fulfilled to the reasonable satisfaction of the Representatives when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be to the reasonable satisfaction of the Representatives and their counsel, this Agreement and all obligations of the Initial Purchasers hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company by telephone or in the manner described in Section 14 hereof.
6. . (a) The Company covenants and agrees with the Representatives that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Exchange Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation and printing of the Time of Sale Information and the Final Offering Memorandum and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivery of copies thereof to the Initial Purchasers and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing this Agreement, the Indenture, the Registration Rights Agreement, the DTC Agreement, any blue sky and legal investment memoranda and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Representatives in connection with such qualification and in connection with any blue sky and legal investment surveys; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities or the Exchange Securities; (v) the cost of preparing the Securities or the Exchange Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture, the Securities and the Exchange Securities; (vii) all fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) of the Company in connection with approval of the Securities by the Depositary for "book-entry" transfer, and the performance by the Company of its other obligations under this Agreement; and (viii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, the Representatives will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any post-closing advertising expenses connected with the Securities or the Exchange Securities.
Expenses
7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Initial Purchasers set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 11 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Initial Purchasers, the Company will reimburse the Initial Purchasers severally upon demand for all reasonable and detailed out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel as stated with particularity) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Initial Purchasers' Expenses
 
8. . Each of the Initial Purchasers, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, hereby agree to observe the following procedures in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities:
Offer, Sale and Resale Procedures
(a) Offers and sales of the Securities will be made only by the Initial Purchasers or Affiliates thereof qualified to do so in the jurisdictions in which such offers or sales are made. Each such offer or sale shall only be made to persons whom the offeror or seller reasonably believes to be QIBs or non-U.S. persons outside the United States to whom the offeror or seller reasonably believes offers and sales of the Securities may be made in reliance upon Regulation S upon the terms and conditions set forth in Annex I hereto, which Annex I is hereby expressly made a part hereof.
(b) The Securities will be offered by approaching prospective Subsequent Purchasers on an individual basis. No general solicitation or general advertising (within the meaning of Rule 502) will be used in the United States in connection with the offering of the Securities.
(c) Each certificate for a Security will bear the applicable legend set forth in the Final Offering Memorandum under the caption "Notice to investors" for the time period and upon the other terms stated in the Final Offering Memorandum:
(d) In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a ""), each Initial Purchaser severally represents, warrants and agrees that, with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the ""), it has not made and will not make an offer of the Securities to the public in that Relevant Member State except that it may, with effect from and including the Relevant Implementation Date, make an offer of the Securities to the public in that Relevant Member State:
Relevant Member State
Relevant Implementation Date
(i) in the period beginning on the date of publication of a prospectus in relation to those Securities which has been approved by the competent authority in that Relevant Member State or, where appropriate, approved in another Relevant Member State and notified to the competent authority in that Relevant Member State, all in accordance with the Prospectus Directive and ending on the date which is 12 months after the date of such publication;
(ii) at any time to legal entities which are authorized or regulated to operate in the financial markets or, if not so authorized or regulated, whose corporate purpose is solely to invest in securities;
(iii) at any time to any legal entity which has two or more of (1) an average of at least 250 employees during the last financial year; (2) a total balance sheet of more than 43,000,000 and (3) an annual net turnover of more than 50,000,000, as shown in its last annual or consolidated accounts; or
 
(iv) at any time in any other circumstances which do not require the publication by the Company of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.
For the purposes of this provision, the expression an "offer of Securities to the public" in relation to any Securities in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Securities to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Securities, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State and the expression Prospectus Directive means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.
9. . The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each person who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Final Offering Memorandum or the Time of Sale Information, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them as such expenses are incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser through the Representatives specifically for use therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution
(b) Each Initial Purchaser severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Initial Purchaser, but only with reference to written information relating to such Initial Purchaser furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Initial Purchaser through the Representatives specifically for use in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Initial Purchaser may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the
 
indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under Sections 9(a) and (b) hereof to the extent it is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such omission. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 9 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel), approved by the Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 9, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent, but if settled with its written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified parties against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in
 
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchasers, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Offering Memorandum. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Initial Purchasers on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount of total underwriting discounts and commissions actually received by it under this Agreement. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchasers' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
10. . If any one or more Initial Purchasers shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Initial Purchasers shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Initial Purchasers) the Securities which the defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase; provided, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Initial Purchasers do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to
Default by an Initial Purchaser
 
any nondefaulting Initial Purchaser or the Company. In the event of a default by any Initial Purchaser as set forth in this Section 10, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Final Offering Memorandum or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Initial Purchaser for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
11. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in any securities of the Company shall have been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange or The Nasdaq National Market shall have been suspended or materially limited, (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared either by Federal or state authorities or a material disruption shall have occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other international or domestic calamity, crisis or change in political, financial or economic conditions, the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to offer, sell or deliver the Securities.
Termination
12. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Initial Purchasers are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of the Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person affiliated with the Company. Additionally, in connection with the offering of the Securities, neither the Representatives nor any other Initial Purchaser is advising the Company or any other person affiliated with the Company as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Initial Purchasers shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Initial Purchasers of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Initial Purchasers and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility
13. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Initial Purchasers set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 9 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 6, 7 and 9 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive
 
14. . All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or telexed and confirmed to it, at the addresses specified in Schedule I hereto; or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telexed and confirmed to it at 7000 Cardinal Place, Dublin, Ohio 43017, Attention: Chief Legal Officer.
Notices
15. . This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 9 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. The term "successors and assigns" shall not include a purchaser, in its capacity as such, of the Securities from any of the Initial Purchasers.
Successors
16. . THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

ANNEX I
Resale Pursuant to Regulation S or Rule 144A. Each Initial Purchaser understands that the Securities have not been and will not be registered under the Act and may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Act. Each Initial Purchaser represents and agrees that it has not offered or sold, and will not offer or sell, any Securities constituting part of its allotment within the United States except in accordance with Rule 903 of Regulation S or Rule 144A. Accordingly, neither it nor its affiliates or any persons acting on its or their behalf have engaged or will engage in any directed selling efforts with respect to the Securities. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S.
Resale Pursuant to Regulation S or Rule 144A. Each Initial Purchaser understands that:
Such Initial Purchaser agrees that it has not offered or sold and will not offer or sell the Securities in the United States or to, or for the benefit or account of, a U.S. Person (other than a distributor), in each case, as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S (i) as part of its distribution at any time and (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Securities pursuant hereto and the Closing Date, other than in accordance with Regulation S or another exemption from the registration requirements of the Act. Such Initial Purchaser agrees that, during such 40-day restricted period, it will not cause any advertisement with respect to the Securities (including any "tombstone" advertisement) to be published in any newspaper or periodical or posted in any public place and will not issue any circular relating to the Securities, except such advertisements as are permitted by and include the statements required by Regulation S.
Such Initial Purchaser agrees that, at or prior to confirmation of a sale of the Securities by it to any distributor, dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration during the 40-day restricted period referred to in Rule 903 of Regulation S, it will send to such distributor, dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration a confirmation or notice to substantially the following effect:
"The Securities covered hereby have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and may not be offered and sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (i) as part of your distribution at any time or (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the date the Securities were first offered to persons other than distributors in reliance upon Regulation S and the Closing Date, except in either case in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act (or in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act or to accredited investors in transactions that are exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act), and in connection with any subsequent sale by you of the Securities covered hereby in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act during the period referred to above to any distributor, dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration, you must deliver a notice to substantially the foregoing effect. Terms used above have the meanings assigned to them in Regulation S under the Securities Act."

This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnified Holder
In case any action or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation or proceeding) shall be brought or asserted against any of the Indemnified Holders with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company, such Indemnified Holder (or the Indemnified Holder controlled by such controlling person) shall promptly notify the Company in writing; ,, that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Company of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement to the extent the Company is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such omission. In case any such action is brought against any Indemnified Holder, and it notifies the Company of the commencement thereof, the Company will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the Indemnified Holder promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such Indemnified Holder, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Holder; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Holder and the Company and the Indemnified Holder shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other Indemnified Holders which are different from or additional to those available to the Company, the Indemnified Holder or Holders shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Holder or Holders. Upon receipt of notice from the Company to such Indemnified Holder of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the Indemnified Holder of counsel (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
provided

delayed), the Company will not be liable to such Indemnified Holder under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Holder in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the Indemnified Holder shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any Indemnified Holder in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel), approved by the Company, representing the Indemnifying Holder or Holders under this paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the Company shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Holder to represent the Indemnified Holder within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the Company has authorized the employment of counsel for the Indemnified Holder at the expense of the Company; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii). The Company shall be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected with the Company's prior written consent, which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably, and the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Holder from and against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of any settlement of any such action effected with the written consent of the Company. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of each Indemnified Holder, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in or otherwise seek to terminate any pending or threatened action, claim, litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not any Indemnified Holder is a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of each Indemnified Holder from all liability arising out of such action, claim, litigation or proceeding.
(b) Each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its directors and officers who sign a Registration Statement, and any Person controlling (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company, and the respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents of each such Person, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each of the Indemnified Holders, but only with respect to claims and actions based on information relating to such Holder furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement. In case any action or proceeding shall be brought against the Company or its directors or officers or any such controlling person in respect of which indemnity may be sought against a Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, such Holder shall have the rights and duties given the Company, and the Company, its directors and officers and such controlling person shall have the rights and duties given to each Holder by the preceding paragraph.
(c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) hereof (other than by reason of exceptions provided in those Sections) in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions or expenses referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the
 
other hand, from the purchase or sale of the Initial Securities (which in the case of the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total gross proceeds to the Company from the Initial Placement, less any discount received by the Initial Purchasers in the Initial Placement), the amount of Additional Interest which did not become payable as a result of the filing of the Registration Statement resulting in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments actions or expenses, and such Registration Statement, or if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Indemnified Holder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Indemnified Holders, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in the second paragraph of Section 8(a) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Company and each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(c) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, none of the Holders (and its related Indemnified Holders) shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount, in the case of the Initial Purchasers, or the net proceeds, in the case of any other Holder, received by such Holder with respect to the Initial Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(c) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Initial Securities held by each of the Holders hereunder and not joint.
S 9. . The Company hereby agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding, to make available to any Holder or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities from such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act.

CUSIP No. 14149YAJ7
ISIN No. US14149YAJ73
 
CARDINAL HEALTH, INC., an Ohio corporation (the ""), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co. or registered assigns, at the office or agency of the Issuer in Columbus, Ohio, the principal sum of THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ($350,000,000) on October 2, 2009 (""), in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, and to pay interest, on January 2, April 2, July 2 and October 2 of each year, commencing January 2, 2007, on said principal sum at said office or agency, in like coin or currency, at the rate per annum specified herein.
Issuer
Maturity
Cash interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from October 3, 2006, to but excluding the relevant payment date, provided that if an interest payment date for the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the interest payment date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day. The Issuer will pay interest quarterly in arrears on each interest payment date, commencing January 2, 2007, to the person in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on the Business Day preceding the interest payment date. Interest will be computed on the basis of the actual number of calendar days in an interest period and a 360-day year.
The Notes will bear interest for each interest period at a rate determined by the calculation agent. The calculation agent for this purpose is The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. until such time as the Issuer appoints a successor calculation agent. The interest rate on the Notes for a particular interest period will be a per annum rate equal to three-month LIBOR as determined on the interest determination date plus 0.27%. The interest determination date for an interest period will be the second London business
 
day preceding such interest period. Promptly upon determination, the calculation agent will inform the Trustee and the Issuer of the interest rate for the next interest period. Absent manifest error, the determination of the interest rate by the calculation agent shall be binding and conclusive on the Holders, the Trustee and the Issuer.
A London business day is a day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
On any interest determination date, LIBOR will be equal to the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, in amounts of at least $1,000,000, as such rate appears on "Telerate Page 3750" at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such interest determination date. If on an interest determination date, such rate does not appear on the "Telerate Page 3750" as of 11:00 a.m., London time, or if the "Telerate Page 3750" is not available on such date, the calculation agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P. page "BBAM."
If no offered rate appears on "Telerate Page 3750" or Bloomberg L.P. page "BBAM" on an interest determination date at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, then the calculation agent (after consultation with the Issuer) will select four major banks in the London interbank market and shall request each of their principal London offices to provide a quotation of the rate at which three-month deposits in U.S. dollars in amounts of at least $1,000,000 are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, on that date and at that time, that is representative of single transactions at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided. Otherwise, the calculation agent will select three major banks in New York City and shall request each of them to provide a quotation of the rate offered by them at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the interest determination date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of three months for the applicable interest period in an amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative of single transactions at that time. If three quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided. Otherwise, the rate of LIBOR for the next interest period will be set equal to the rate of LIBOR for the then current interest period.
Upon request from any Holder, the calculation agent will provide the interest rate in effect on the Notes for the current interest period and, if it has been determined, the interest rate to be in effect for the next interest period.
Dollar amounts resulting from such calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
Reference is made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof. Such further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
This Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by the Trustee under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof.

CARDINAL HEALTH, INC., an Ohio corporation (the ""), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co. or registered assigns, at the office or agency of the Issuer in Columbus, Ohio, the principal sum of ZERO DOLLARS ($0) on October 2, 2009 (""), in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, and to pay interest, on January 2, April 2, July 2 and October 2 of each year, commencing January 2, 2007, on said principal sum at said office or agency, in like coin or currency, at the rate per annum specified herein.
Issuer
Maturity
Cash interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from October 3, 2006, to but excluding the relevant payment date, provided that if an interest payment date for the Notes falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the interest payment date shall be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day. The Issuer will pay interest quarterly in arrears on each interest payment date, commencing January 2, 2007, to the person in whose name the Notes are registered at the close of business on the Business Day preceding the interest payment date. Interest will be computed on the basis of the actual number of calendar days in an interest period and a 360-day year.
The Notes will bear interest for each interest period at a rate determined by the calculation agent. The calculation agent for this purpose is The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. until such time as the Issuer appoints a successor calculation agent. The interest rate on the Notes for a particular interest period will be a per annum rate equal to three-month LIBOR as determined on the interest determination date plus 0.27%. The interest determination date for an interest period will be the second London business day preceding such interest period. Promptly upon determination, the calculation agent will inform the Trustee and the Issuer of the interest rate for the next interest period. Absent manifest error, the determination of the interest rate by the calculation agent shall be binding and conclusive on the Holders, the Trustee and the Issuer.
A London business day is a day on which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
On any interest determination date, LIBOR will be equal to the offered rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having an index maturity of three months, in amounts of at least $1,000,000, as such rate appears on "Telerate Page 3750" at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such interest determination date. If on an interest determination date, such rate does not appear on the "Telerate Page 3750" as of 11:00 a.m., London time, or if the "Telerate Page 3750" is not available on such date, the calculation agent will obtain such rate from Bloomberg L.P. page "BBAM."
 
If no offered rate appears on "Telerate Page 3750" or Bloomberg L.P. page "BBAM" on an interest determination date at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, then the calculation agent (after consultation with the Issuer) will select four major banks in the London interbank market and shall request each of their principal London offices to provide a quotation of the rate at which three-month deposits in U.S. dollars in amounts of at least $1,000,000 are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market, on that date and at that time, that is representative of single transactions at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided. Otherwise, the calculation agent will select three major banks in New York City and shall request each of them to provide a quotation of the rate offered by them at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the interest determination date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having an index maturity of three months for the applicable interest period in an amount of at least $1,000,000 that is representative of single transactions at that time. If three quotations are provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic average of the quotations provided. Otherwise, the rate of LIBOR for the next interest period will be set equal to the rate of LIBOR for the then current interest period.
Upon request from any Holder, the calculation agent will provide the interest rate in effect on the Notes for the current interest period and, if it has been determined, the interest rate to be in effect for the next interest period.
Dollar amounts resulting from such calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
Reference is made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof. Such further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though fully set forth at this place.
This Note shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by the Trustee under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof.
