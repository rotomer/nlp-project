Introductory Note:
 
On April 10, 2007, the Company completed the sale of the PTS Business to Phoenix Charter LLC ("Phoenix"), an affiliate of The Blackstone Group, pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement between the Company and Phoenix, dated as of January 25, 2007 and as amended as of March 9, 2007 and as of April 10, 2007 (the "Purchase Agreement"). At the closing of the sale, the Company received approximately $3.2 billion in cash from Phoenix, which was the purchase price of approximately $3.3 billion as adjusted pursuant to certain provisions in the Purchase Agreement for the working capital, cash, indebtedness and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of the PTS Business.
The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Purchase Agreement, Amendment No. 1 to the Purchase Agreement and Amendment No. 2 to the Purchase Agreement, which are attached to this Form 8-K/A as Exhibits 2.01, 2.02 and 2.03, respectively. The Purchase Agreement has been attached to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company or Phoenix or their respective businesses or operations. In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Purchase Agreement are qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules provided by the Company and Phoenix to each other in connection with the signing of the Purchase Agreement. These disclosure schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Moreover, certain representations, warranties and covenants in the Purchase Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk between the Company, on the one hand, and Phoenix, on the other hand, rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants in the Purchase Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about the Company or Phoenix or their respective businesses or operations.
 
(b) The Company's estimate of the total costs before taxes for each major type of cost to be incurred in connection with the sale of the PTS Business is as follows:
 
(c) The Company's estimate of the total costs before taxes to be incurred in connection with the sale of the PTS Business is approximately $83 million.
(d) The Company's estimate of the total costs before taxes that will result in future cash expenditures in connection with the sale of the PTS Business is approximately $62 million.
 
(b) Pro Forma Financial Information
Exhibit 99.01 to this Form 8-K/A, which is incorporated in this Form 8-K/A by reference, includes: (1) the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of earnings of the Company for the six months ended December 31, 2006 and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, assuming that the disposition of the PTS Business occurred at the beginning of those periods; (2) the unaudited pro forma condensed
 
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2006, assuming that the disposition of the PTS Business occurred as of that date; and (3) the related notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements.

(c) Prior to Closing, a nationally recognized actuary selected and paid for by Seller ("") will prepare an estimate of the Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation associated with the Transferred Entity Retiree Welfare Plans measured as of the Closing Date. Before the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser will cause a nationally recognized actuary selected and paid for by Purchaser ("") to determine its own estimate of the Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation associated with the Transferred Entity Retiree Welfare Plans measured as of the Closing Date. As soon as practicable thereafter, the Seller OPEB Actuary and the Purchaser OPEB Actuary shall make a good faith attempt to reconcile any difference in their calculations to arrive at a final calculation. In the event that attempts at reconciliation fail and if the Purchaser OPEB Actuary's calculation is within five percent (5%) of the Seller OPEB Actuary's calculation of the Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation, the average of the Seller OPEB Actuary's calculation and the Purchaser OPEB Actuary's calculation shall be used as the final calculation. If the difference
Seller OPEB Actuary
Purchaser OPEB Actuary
 
cannot be reconciled and exceeds five percent (5%), the Seller OPEB Actuary and the Purchaser OPEB Actuary shall jointly designate a third independent actuary whose verification shall be final and binding, but not greater than the calculation of the Purchaser OPEB Actuary or less than the calculation of the Seller OPEB Actuary. The Purchaser and Seller shall each pay one-half the costs of such third actuary. When the amount of Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation associated with the Transferee Retiree Welfare Benefit Plans is finally determined as provided herein, Seller shall pay to Purchaser as soon as then practicable the excess, if any, of the determined amount of Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation as of the Closing Date over $5,000,000 (the ""), subject to the limitations under Section 10.5 applicable to indemnifications under Section 10.2(d).

International Plans
(b) Prior to Closing, Seller shall, if so requested by the Trustees of the UK Plan, provide the Purchaser with access to the trustees of the UK Plan for the purposes of reaching an agreement in relation to funding of the UK Plan and, if a clearance application is made under Section 6.5(a), seeking clearance from the Pensions Regulator.

7.3 . To the extent permitted or required by Law or administrative practice, the taxable year of each of the Transferred Entities which includes the Closing Date shall be treated as closing on (and including) the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, where it is necessary to apportion between Seller and Purchaser the Tax liability of any of the Transferred Entities (or with respect to the Transferred Receivables) for a Straddle Period (which is not treated under the immediately preceding sentence as closing on the Closing Date), such liability shall be apportioned between the period deemed to end at the close of the Closing Date and the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date on the basis of an interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date or, in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or personal property Taxes, but not gross receipts, sales or use Taxes or Taxes based upon or related to income), the amount of such liability for such Straddle Period that shall be apportioned to the period ending at the close of the Closing Date shall be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period; that in the case of a Straddle Period of a CFC, the amount includible under Section 951 of the Code (and any related foreign Tax credit under Section 960 of the Code) in respect of such CFC that is attributable to
Allocation of Certain Taxes
provided
 
the Pre-Closing Period portion of the Straddle Period shall be determined based on a closing of the books as of the Closing as if the taxable year of the CFC had ended on the Closing Date (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed and understood that such amount shall not give rise to an Indemnified Tax until such time as the actual inclusion of such amount as provided under Section 951 results in an actual Tax liability determined on a with and without basis). For the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes relating to the Restructuring and any Taxes resulting from the inclusion by any of the Transferred Entities of any "deferred intercompany gain" pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13 or "excess loss account" pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-19 upon the sale of the Transferred Interests shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Period.

Notwithstanding any other provision, Purchaser shall not prepare or file, or cause to be prepared or filed, any amended Tax Return relating to Indemnified Taxes without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
provided
(c) In the case of any Tax Return which Purchaser is responsible for preparing under Section 7.4(b) (i) for a Straddle Period or (ii) with respect to Indemnified Taxes, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Transferred Entities to deliver to Seller for its review, comment and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) a copy of such proposed Tax Return (accompanied, in the case of any Tax Return for a Straddle Period, by an allocation between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing Period of the Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Return) at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the due date (giving effect to any validly obtained extension thereof). Purchaser shall accept any comments provided by Seller as to which Purchaser agrees.

(d) In addition to any other Tax Benefit to which Seller is entitled under this Agreement, Seller shall be entitled to any actually realized Tax Benefit (calculated on a with and without basis) arising from the payment or accrual after the Closing Date of any Indemnified Tax, but only to the extent such Tax Benefit is actually realized with respect to a taxable period ending within four and a half (4.5) years after the end of the taxable period in which the Indemnified Tax is paid or accrued. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall claim any such Tax Benefit with respect to a Post-Closing Period; , , that if any such Tax Benefit is not permitted by Law or administrative practice to be claimed for a Pre-Closing Period and is permitted by Law or administrative practice to be claimed on a Tax Return for a Post-Closing Period, then Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts (exercising its reasonable discretion in relation to the availability of such Tax Benefit) to claim such Tax Benefit. If any Tax Benefit for which Purchaser has made a payment to Seller under this Section 7.4(d) is subsequently disallowed, Seller shall promptly repay such amount to Purchaser.

Upon the reasonable request of Seller and at Seller's expense, Purchaser agrees to file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns) or other documents claiming any such refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled pursuant to the preceding sentence. Purchaser shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of the Transferred Entities of or against any Taxes other than refunds or credits to which Seller is entitled under the first sentence of this Section 7.5 or otherwise under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller, and not Purchaser, shall be entitled to the refunds or credits set forth in Section 7.5(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.
Refunds, Credits and Carrybacks
(b) Purchaser shall cause the Transferred Entities promptly to forward to Seller or to reimburse Seller for any refunds or credits due Seller (pursuant to the terms of this Article VII) after receipt thereof, and Seller shall promptly forward to Purchaser or reimburse Purchaser for any refunds or credits due Purchaser (pursuant to the terms of this Article VII) after receipt thereof.

however, the event that such carryback prevents or impedes Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (or a Transferred Entity for a Pre-Closing Period) from obtaining any Tax Benefit, Purchaser shall pay Seller the amount of the Tax Benefit that would have been obtained in the absence of such carryback, calculated on a with and without basis. Purchaser agrees that none of the Transferred Entities shall carry back any Subsequent Loss into the consolidated federal income Tax Return of the affiliated group of which Seller is the common parent or any other Tax Return that includes Seller or any Affiliate of Seller that is not a Transferred Entity (, , that if such a carry back is required by Law, then Seller shall be entitled to any resulting Tax Benefit).

The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts (exercising its reasonable discretion in relation to the availability of such Tax Benefit and ability not to suffer such Tax Detriment) to claim such Tax Benefit and not suffer such Tax Detriment. For purposes of this Agreement, Losses shall be calculated after giving effect to any amounts recovered from third parties, including amounts recovered under insurance policies with respect to such Losses, net of any costs to recover such amounts. Any Indemnified Party having a claim under these indemnification provisions shall make a good-faith effort to recover all losses, costs, damages and expenses from insurers of such Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies so as to reduce the amount of any Losses hereunder; that actual recovery of any insurance shall not be a condition to the Indemnifying Party's obligation to make indemnification payments to the Indemnified Party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for Loss, after an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party has been made for such Loss, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for such indemnification payment up to the amount so received or realized by the Indemnified Party. No Indemnified Party will, in any event, be entitled to any incidental, indirect, consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages (other any such damages payable to third parties). The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 10.2 for any Loss relating to any matter to the extent that the amount of such Loss is reflected in the calculation of Final Closing Working Capital or Final Closing Indebtedness.

Exhibit 99.01
The following pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is based on the historical financial statements of Cardinal Health, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company"), including certain pro forma adjustments, and has been prepared to illustrate the pro forma effect of the disposition of the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment, other than the Martindale and Beckloff businesses (the segment, excluding the Martindale and Beckloff businesses, is hereinafter referred to as the "PTS Business"). The Company has previously reported operating results of the PTS Business as discontinued operations in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 (the "December 31, 2006 Form10-Q").
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of earnings for the six months ended December 31, 2006 and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 assume that the disposition of the PTS Business occurred prior to those periods. The statements of earnings do not include the gain on the sale or costs associated with the sale. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 is presented as if the disposition of the PTS Business had occurred as of that date.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared based upon available information and management estimates; actual amounts may differ from these estimated amounts. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that might have occurred had the disposition occurred as of the dates stated above. The pro forma adjustments are described in the notes.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes and related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 and unaudited interim financial statements and the related MD&A included in the December 31, 2006 Form 10-Q.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements give effect to the pro forma adjustments necessary to reflect the disposition of the PTS Business as if the disposition occurred at the beginning of the periods presented in the pro forma statements of earnings and as of December 31, 2006 in the pro forma balance sheet. In accordance with Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, the pro forma statements of earnings disclose earnings from continuing operations before nonrecurring charges and therefore exclude historical earnings from discontinued operations of $402.7 million for the six months ended December 31, 2006 and historical losses from discontinued operations of $244.6 million, $57.6 million and $4.2 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, a historical loss of $38.5 million related to a cumulative effect of change in accounting is excluded from the pro forma statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of earnings and balance sheet reflect the effect of the following pro forma adjustments:
