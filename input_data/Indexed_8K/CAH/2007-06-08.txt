On June 8, 2007, Cardinal Health, Inc. (the "Company") issued and sold $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.65% notes due 2012 (the "2012 Notes") and $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.00% notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes" and together with the 2012 notes, the "Notes") in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.
The Notes are governed by an Indenture dated as of April 18, 1997 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., (successor to J.P. Morgan Trust Company, National Association, successor to Bank One, N.A., formerly known as Bank One, Columbus, N.A.), as trustee, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated June 8, 2007 (the "Indenture").
The 2012 Notes mature on June 15, 2012 and the 2017 Notes will mature on June 15, 2017. Interest on each of the 2012 Notes and the 2017 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2007. The Company may redeem the Notes at any time prior to maturity, in whole or in part, at the applicable redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. If the Company experiences specific types of change of control, it may be required to offer to purchase the Notes from the holders.
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with all of the Company's existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to all of the Company's existing and future subordinated debt.
The Company expects to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund a portion of the purchase price of the VIASYS Healthcare Inc. acquisition and for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, repayment of other indebtedness and repurchases of the Company's equity securities.
In connection with the sale of the Notes, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, dated June 8, 2007, with the initial purchasers of the Notes. Under the registration rights agreement, the Company agreed, among other things, to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) file and cause to become effective a registration statement with respect to an exchange of the Notes within 240 days of the issuance of the Notes and (ii) to complete the exchange offer for the Notes within 270 days of the issuance of the Notes. The Company also agreed to file a shelf registration statement relating to the resale of the Notes if the exchange offer is not consummated within the time period set forth in the previous sentence and under other circumstances specified in the registration rights agreement.

Unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, the Notes to be redeemed in whole or in part.

This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnified Holder
In case any action or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation or proceeding) shall be brought or asserted against any of the Indemnified Holders with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the Company, such Indemnified Holder (or the Indemnified Holder controlled by such controlling person) shall promptly notify the Company in writing; ,, that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Company of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement to the extent the Company is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such omission. In case any such action is brought against any Indemnified Holder, and it notifies the Company of the commencement thereof, the Company will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the Indemnified Holder promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such Indemnified Holder, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such Indemnified Holder; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Holder and the Company and the Indemnified Holder shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other Indemnified Holders which are different from or additional to those available to the Company, the Indemnified Holder or Holders shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Holder or Holders. Upon receipt of notice from the Company to such Indemnified Holder of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the Indemnified Holder of counsel (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Company will not be liable to such Indemnified Holder under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Holder in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the Indemnified Holder shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that

The Company shall be liable for any settlement of any such action or proceeding effected with the Company's prior written consent, which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably, and the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Holder from and against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of any settlement of any such action effected with the written consent of the Company. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of each Indemnified Holder, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in or otherwise seek to terminate any pending or threatened action, claim, litigation or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not any Indemnified Holder is a party thereto), unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of each Indemnified Holder from all liability arising out of such action, claim, litigation or proceeding.
(b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its directors and officers who sign a Registration Statement, and any Person controlling (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company, and the respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents of each such Person, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each of the Indemnified Holders, but only with respect to claims and actions based on information relating to such Holder furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement. In case any action or proceeding shall be brought against the Company or its directors or officers or any such controlling person in respect of which indemnity may be sought against a Holder, such Holder shall have the rights and duties given the Company, and the Company, its directors and officers and such controlling person shall have the rights and duties given to each Holder by the preceding paragraph.
(c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) hereof (other than by reason of exceptions provided in those Sections) in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, actions or expenses referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, from the purchase or sale of the Initial Securities (which in the case of the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total gross proceeds to the Company from the Initial Placement, less any discount received by the Initial Purchasers in the Initial Placement), the amount of Additional Interest which did not become payable as a result of the filing of the Registration Statement resulting in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, judgments actions or
 
expenses, and such Registration Statement, or if such allocation is not permitted by applicable law, the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Indemnified Holder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Indemnified Holders, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in the second paragraph of Section 8(a) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(c) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, none of the Holders (and its related Indemnified Holders) shall be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount, in the case of the Initial Purchasers, or the net proceeds, in the case of any other Holder, received by such Holder with respect to the Initial Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Holders' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(c) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Initial Securities held by each of the Holders hereunder and not joint.
