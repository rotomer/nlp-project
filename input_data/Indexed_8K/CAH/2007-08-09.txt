 Cardinal Health, a global provider of products and services that improve the safety and productivity of health care, reported fourth-quarter results today that highlighted the company's fast-growing clinical and medical products businesses, which turned in double-digit revenue and profit growth for the period.
DUBLIN, Ohio, Aug. 9, 2007
During the fourth quarter, ended June 30, consolidated revenue increased 5 percent to $22.3 billion and earnings from continuing operations declined 22 percent to $238 million primarily due to merger-related charges from the company's recent acquisition of VIASYS Healthcare. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings from continuing operations increased 5 percent to $345 million

on a diluted per-share basis.
R. Kerry Clark, chief executive officer of Cardinal Health said: "Fiscal 2007 was a strong year and marks an inflection point in the performance of the company. In the fourth quarter, our core supply chain services sector performed as we previously indicated, and delivered robust full-year results. Within the sector, pharmaceutical supply chain had a good year and we continue to anticipate a strong fiscal 2008 for this business.
"Within our clinical and medical products sector, we delivered excellent performance during the fourth quarter and have great momentum as we begin fiscal 2008. This sector complements our supply chain business and continues to differentiate Cardinal Health in the market. It has also emerged as significant, value-creating growth engine by contributing more than 25 percent of total segment profit during the year."

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP operating earnings, non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations, non-GAAP return on equity and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are operating earnings, earnings from continuing operations, return on equity and effective tax rate from continuing operations. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast special items and impairment charges and other, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.

Exhibit 99.2
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), Cardinal Health, Inc.'s (the "Company's") earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company has provided reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measures. Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the amounts that have been adjusted as a supplemental metric to assist readers. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings release.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP operating earnings." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items and impairment charges and other. The Company's "special items" consist of costs relating to the integration of previously-acquired companies, which may include employee-related costs, asset impairments and other exit costs and integration costs, or costs of restructuring operations, which may include employee-related costs, asset impairments and facility exit costs. The Company also records as special items settlements of significant lawsuits that are infrequent or unusual in nature, including the $600 million litigation reserve recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 that was associated with a pending class action securities lawsuit against the Company. The Company records as special items legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and Audit Committee internal review and related matters. The Company also records, from time to time, other material charges that are one-time, unusual or infrequent in nature as special items. For further discussion of items classified as special items, see the notes to the financial statements contained in the Company's Annual and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
Non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation).
As discussed above, the Company classifies certain asset impairments related to restructurings in special items, which are included in operating earnings within the consolidated statements of earnings. Asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets not eligible to be classified as special items or discontinued operations are classified within "impairment charges and other" within the consolidated statements of earnings. For further discussion of items classified as impairment charges and other, see the notes to the financial statements contained in the Company's Annual and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance. As the Company's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use financial measures that do not include charges and gains associated with restructuring, merger-related activity and litigation and other asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets. While these special items and impairment charges and other may be recurring, management believes that these items and charges are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions, without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that the measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with operating earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items and impairment charges and other separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, and impairment charges and other, net of tax. See the discussion of special items and impairment charges and other above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items and impairment charges and other classifications. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance.

Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and presentations derived from it (per share and growth rate calculations).
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that this measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with earnings from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items and impairment charges and other separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on equity." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items classification. Due to the classification of the Company's former Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment ("PTS") as discontinued operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and its subsequent sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, for the three months ended June 30, 2007, the numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes the $679.5 million net of tax gain on the sale of PTS recorded in discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, the numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes the $1.1 billion net of tax gain on the sale of PTS recorded in discontinued operations, of which $425 million was recorded in discontinued operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The adjustments related to the PTS sale for each of the three months and fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 are referred to hereinafter as the "PTS adjustments."
Non-GAAP return on equity.
Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance. As the Company's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use a financial measure that does not include charges and gains associated with restructuring, merger-related activity and litigation. While these special items may be recurring, management believes that these items are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions, without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business. The PTS adjustments are excluded for similar reasons.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that this measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded special items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with return on equity (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher or lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance, as well as the PTS tax adjustments.
 
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on invested capital." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items classification. Due to the classification of the Company's former PTS segment as discontinued operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and its subsequent sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes interest expense and other and the PTS adjustments.
Non-GAAP return on invested capital.
Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance. As the Company's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use a financial measure that does not include charges and gains associated with restructuring, merger-related activity and litigation. While these special items may be recurring, management believes that these items are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions, without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business. The PTS adjustments are excluded for similar reasons. With respect to excluding interest expense and other, in connection with classifying the PTS segment as discontinued operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company changed its methodology for calculating return on invested capital to use net earnings in the numerator instead of operating earnings. Because interest expense and other was not included in the prior methodology for calculating return on invested capital by nature of utilizing operating earnings in the calculation, it is excluded in the current methodology for the sake of comparability with historical results.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that this measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded special items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with return on invested capital (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher or lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance, as well as the PTS adjustments.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of special items from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items classification. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance because special items may be taxed differently than other items.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that this measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded special items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with effective tax rate from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find this non-GAAP measure useful to evaluate the Company's future performance because special items may have a different tax impact than other items.
The Company also presents the non-GAAP financial measure "net debt to capital," which is net debt divided by capital (net debt plus total shareholders' equity). "Net debt," also a non-GAAP financial measure, is debt (the most comparable GAAP measure, calculated as long-term obligations plus short-term borrowings) minus cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale. Management believes that net debt to capital is an important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet. With respect to net debt, cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale are subtracted from the GAAP measure because they could be used to reduce the Company's debt obligations.
Net debt to capital.
 
The limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale and therefore may imply that there is less Company debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. This limitation is best addressed by using net debt in combination with debt because net debt may be significantly lower than the GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet.
