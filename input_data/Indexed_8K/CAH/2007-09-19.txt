Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP operating earnings, non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP return on equity (and presentations derived from these financial measures) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are operating earnings, earnings from continuing operations and return on equity. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast special items and impairment charges and other, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.
