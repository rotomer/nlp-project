 Cardinal Health, a global provider of products and services that improve the safety and productivity of health care, today reported a revenue increase of 7 percent to $23 billion during its second quarter, with earnings per share (EPS) rising 16 percent to $0.89. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS for the quarter ended Dec. 31 grew 8 percent to $0.90.
DUBLIN, Ohio, Jan. 29, 2008

The company also announced a revision to its full year EPS outlook based on several factors affecting its largest operating segment in the second half of the year. Cardinal Health now expects non-GAAP EPS to be in a range of $3.75 to $3.85 for the year, an increase of 10 percent to 13 percent over the prior year.
"We have three of our four operating segments performing on track, showing favorable revenue growth, expanding margins and segment profit that is at or above our guidance for the current year," said R. Kerry Clark, chairman and chief executive officer of Cardinal Health. "Within our supply chain pharmaceutical segment, we have revised our forecast to account for the impact of anti-diversion measures for controlled substances, changes in our expectations for branded price increases and the generics market, and the effect of contract repricings. We still expect double-digit EPS growth for the year and are resolved to strengthen the business as we fix the issues that have hampered our performance.
"We continue to engage in discussions with the DEA to resolve matters affecting three of our pharmaceutical distribution centers regarding the diversion of controlled substances," Clark added. "More broadly, in the past 45 days we have been working to put in place an enhanced system of controls across our network to address the security threat that diversion poses to the

pharmaceutical supply chain. The impact of these issues may cost more than $30 million for this fiscal year, but the safety and security of the pharmaceutical supply chain is core to our business and its protection is an important public policy priority for all of us."
Q2 and FY08 Year-to-Date Summary
 
Second quarter segment results
Healthcare Supply Chain Services Sector
Revenue in the segment grew 6 percent during the quarter to $20.4 billion, with sales to non-bulk customers increasing 1 percent to $10.7 billion and sales to bulk customers increasing 12 percent to $9.7 billion. Segment profit declined 21 percent to $258 million, driven by the timing of branded price increases, conditions in the market for generic pharmaceuticals, and the repricing of several large contracts. Results were also dampened by the impact of suspensions to distribute controlled substances from three facilities and enhancements to anti-diversion programs being implemented across the company's entire distribution network. The company continues to expect segment profit to improve in the second half of the fiscal year. Following the close of the quarter, Cardinal Health also completed an early renewal of a three-year, multi-billion-dollar agreement with Walgreens to distribute pharmaceuticals to more than 6,000 drug stores nationwide.
Healthcare Supply Chain Services-Pharmaceutical
The segment saw revenue growth of 8 percent to $2 billion, with increased sales momentum from the prior quarter to hospital, laboratory and ambulatory care customers. Segment profit declined 13 percent to $72 million, primarily driven by a previously disclosed change in corporate cost allocation that reduced segment profit by 7 percentage points and softness in the surgical kitting business. The company continues to expect the segment to return to year-over-year profit growth in the second half of the year from strength in the hospital and laboratory supply businesses.
Healthcare Supply Chain Services-Medical

Clinical and Medical Products Sector
"This quarter, the Clinical and Medical Products (CMP) sector was again an exceptional value driver by accounting for 36 percent of our total segment profit," Clark said. "CMP continues to play a substantial role in our overall results with leading products in the areas of patient safety and infection prevention, both essential and rapidly growing segments of health care."
Revenue for the segment grew 47 percent to $667 million driven by strong sales of infection prevention products and surgical instruments, and the addition of VIASYS Healthcare, which the company acquired last June. Segment profit increased 46 percent to $69 million and benefited from the VIASYS acquisition, which remains ahead of schedule in delivering synergies of $85 million to $100 million per year by fiscal 2010.
Medical Products and Technology
The segment grew revenue 8 percent to $715 million for the quarter, with strong demand for Pyxis dispensing and supply technologies and strength in Alaris infusion products. Segment profit increased 26 percent to $115 million from favorable product mix and improved operating leverage. Segment profit was negatively affected by a $10 million charge for the Alaris Pump module voluntary recall, bringing the total charges associated with the recall to $14 million.
Clinical Technologies and Services
Additional second quarter and recent highlights include:
 
 
 
 
 
Outlook
Cardinal Health lowered and narrowed the range it expects for fiscal 2008 non-GAAP diluted EPS to $3.75 to $3.85. It previously expected non-GAAP EPS in a range of $3.95 to $4.15. In making the change, Cardinal Health cited several factors that are having an impact on its Healthcare Supply Chain Services-Pharmaceutical segment, including the timing of new launches and deflationary environment for generic pharmaceuticals; expectations for branded price increases; the repricing of some large customer contracts; and the impact of anti-diversion enhancements.

These matters are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied. The most significant of these uncertainties are described in Cardinal Health's Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K reports (including all amendments to those reports) and exhibits to those reports, and include (but are not limited to) the following: competitive pressures in its various lines of business; the loss of one or more key customer or supplier relationships or changes to the terms of those relationships; uncertainties relating to timing of generic introductions and the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price appreciation or generic pharmaceutical price deflation; changes in the distribution patterns or reimbursement rates for health-care products and/or services; the results, consequences, effects or timing of any inquiry or investigation by any regulatory authority or any legal or administrative proceedings; future actions of regulatory bodies or government authorities relating to our manufacturing or sale of products and other costs or claims that could arise from our manufacturing, compounding or repackaging operations or from other services; the costs, difficulties and uncertainties related to the integration of acquired businesses; and general economic and market conditions.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations, non-GAAP return on equity, and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations, return on equity and effective tax rate from continuing operations. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast special items and impairment charges and other, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.

Exhibit 99.2
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), Cardinal Health, Inc.'s (the "Company's") earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company has provided reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measures. Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the amounts that have been adjusted as a supplemental metric to assist readers. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings release.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP operating earnings" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items and impairment charges and other.
Non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation).
The Company classifies restructuring charges, acquisition integration charges and certain litigation and other items as special items. A restructuring activity is a program whereby the Company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing facilities, moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re-alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. Restructuring charges may include employee-related costs, facility exit and other costs and asset impairments.
Acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate acquired companies. Acquisition integration charges may include employee-related costs, asset impairments and other exit costs, in-process research and development costs and other integration costs.
Amounts attributable to significant lawsuits that are infrequent, non-recurring or unusual in nature are recognized as "litigation and other" in special items. The Company also classified legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the previously-disclosed SEC investigation and related matters as special items.
Asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets not eligible to be classified as special items or discontinued operations are classified within impairment charges and other within the consolidated statements of earnings.
For further discussion of items classified as special items and impairment charges and other, see the notes to the financial statements contained in the Company's Annual and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
Management uses non-GAAP operating earnings to evaluate the Company's performance. As the Company's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use financial measures that do not include charges and gains associated with restructuring, merger-related activity and litigation and other asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets. While these special items and impairment charges and other may be recurring, management believes that these items and charges are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions, without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that the measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include
transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with operating earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items and impairment charges and other separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, and impairment charges and other, net of tax. See the discussion of special items and impairment charges and other above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items and impairment charges and other classifications.

The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on equity." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items classification. In addition, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, the numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes a $425 million income tax benefit related to the classification of the Company's former Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment as discontinued operations during the three months ended December 31, 2006 (the "PTS tax benefit").
Non-GAAP return on equity.
Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance. As the Company's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use a financial measure that does not include charges and gains associated with restructuring, merger-related activity and litigation.

The PTS tax benefit is excluded for the three and six months ended December 31, 2006 for similar reasons.

The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on invested capital." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items classification. The numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes interest expense and other because invested capital includes both debt and equity. In addition, for the three and six months ended December 31, 2006, the numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes the PTS tax benefit.

The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of special items from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items classification. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance because special items may be taxed differently than other items.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that this measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded special items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with effective tax rate from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find this non-GAAP measure useful to evaluate the Company's future performance because special items may have a different tax impact than other items.
The Company also presents the non-GAAP financial measure "net debt to capital," which is net debt divided by capital (net debt plus total shareholders' equity). "Net debt," also a non-GAAP financial measure, is debt (the most comparable GAAP measure, calculated as long-term obligations plus short-term borrowings) minus cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale. Management believes that net debt to capital is an important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet. With respect to net debt, cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale are subtracted from the GAAP measure because they could be used to reduce the Company's debt obligations.
Net debt to capital.
 
The limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale and therefore may imply that there is less Company debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. This limitation is best addressed by using net debt in combination with debt because net debt may be significantly lower than the GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet.
