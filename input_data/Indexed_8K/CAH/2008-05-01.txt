 Cardinal Health, a global provider of products and services that improve the safety and productivity of health care, today reported a revenue increase of 5 percent for its third quarter to nearly $23 billion, with GAAP earnings per share (EPS) reaching $1.02 from a $0.01 loss in the prior-year period.
DUBLIN, Ohio, May 1, 2008
Special items related to acquisition integration, litigation and restructuring, and impairment charges and other items had a $0.06 dilutive impact on GAAP earnings for the quarter, bringing non-GAAP EPS to $1.08
1
, an increase of 13 percent from the prior-year period.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer R. Kerry Clark said, "Our consolidated business and three of our four operating segments are performing to our expectations. We saw a healthy revenue increase in our clinical and medical products sector, with excellent leverage to the profit line. And our supply chain medical segment continued the turnaround we began earlier this year with a strong quarter of profitable growth.
"Within our supply chain pharmaceutical segment, we are managing the same issues we outlined last quarter, including the re-pricing of large retail accounts and the impact of our controlled substance anti-diversion efforts. However, we have renewed all of our major contracts through fiscal 2009 and, with respect to our anti-diversion efforts, we are putting in place new systems that we believe will return us to a strong position in managing this important industry issue."

Q3 and FY08 Year-to-Date Summary
 
Third quarter segment results
Healthcare Supply Chain Services Sector
The segment reported a 3 percent increase in revenue to $19.9 billion. Sales to bulk customers increased 8 percent to $9.1 billion, while sales to non-bulk customers were even with the prior year at $10.8 billion. Revenue growth was dampened by several factors, including customer disruption as the company enhances anti-diversion controls and strengthens its offerings, and by slower overall market growth. Segment profit declined 21 percent to $300 million, primarily from the continued impact of re-pricing several large contracts and the impact of anti-diversion initiatives.
Healthcare Supply Chain Services  Pharmaceutical
Revenue for the segment grew 8 percent to $2.1 billion, with increased sales penetration and growth of existing hospital, lab and ambulatory customers. As expected, the segment returned to positive profit growth during the quarter, with profit increasing 5 percent to $93 million, driven by increased sales volume. Segment profit growth was dampened by a previously disclosed change in corporate cost allocation and by continued softness in the surgical kitting business.
Healthcare Supply Chain Services  Medical
Clinical and Medical Products Sector
"Our Clinical and Medical products sector continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth, reflecting our leadership positions in medication dispensing, infusion, respiratory and infection prevention products," Clark said. "We will continue to invest in these businesses to strengthen our offerings for the future."
The segment grew revenue by 48 percent to $679 million, driven by the acquisition of VIASYS Healthcare and strong growth within the core infection prevention and medical specialty businesses. Segment profit grew 72 percent to $80 million on the VIASYS addition, strong organic growth and the benefit of foreign exchange. The VIASYS integration remains on schedule to deliver $85 million to $100 million in synergies by fiscal 2010.
Medical Products and Technologies
 
Cardinal Health Reports Third Quarter Results

Revenue for the segment increased by 11 percent to $747 million, driven by continued growth in customer installations for medication and supply dispensing products and infusion pumps. Segment profit increased by 29 percent to $127 million from a favorable product mix and improved operating leverage from expense management initiatives. Segment profit for the quarter was partially offset by a $6.5 million reserve for a recall of integrated circuits and connectors on certain Alaris System modules. The company believes it is fully reserved for remediation efforts on all Alaris product recalls and expects to complete them by the end of the calendar year.

Outlook
The company reaffirmed its non-GAAP EPS range of $3.75 to $3.85 for fiscal 2008. Clark stated, "As the remainder of the year unfolds, we expect full-year, non-GAAP EPS to be about in the middle of the range, excluding the potential dilutive impact of the Enturia acquisition of 1 to 2 cents."

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations, non-GAAP return on equity, and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations, return on equity and effective tax rate from continuing operations. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast special items and impairment charges and other, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.

Exhibit 99.2
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), Cardinal Health, Inc.'s (the "Company's") earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company has provided reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measures. Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the amounts that have been adjusted as a supplemental metric to assist readers. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings release.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP operating earnings" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items and impairment charges and other.
Non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation).
The Company classifies restructuring charges, acquisition integration charges and certain litigation and other items as special items. A restructuring activity is a program whereby the Company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing facilities, moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re-alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. Restructuring charges include employee-related costs, facility exit and other costs and asset impairments.
Acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate acquired companies. Acquisition integration charges include employee-related costs, asset impairments and other exit costs, in-process research and development costs and other integration costs.
Amounts attributable to significant lawsuits that are infrequent, non-recurring or unusual in nature as well as all litigation gains are recognized as "litigation and other" in special items. The Company also classified legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the previously-disclosed SEC investigation and related matters as special items.
Asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets not eligible to be classified as special items or discontinued operations are classified within impairment charges and other within the consolidated statements of earnings.
For further discussion of items classified as special items and impairment charges and other, see the notes to the financial statements contained in the Company's Annual and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
Management uses non-GAAP operating earnings to evaluate the Company's performance. As the Company's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use financial measures that do not include charges and gains associated with restructuring, merger-related activity and litigation and other asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets. While these special items and impairment charges and other may be recurring, management believes that these items and charges are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions, without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that the measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include
transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with operating earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items and impairment charges and other separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, and impairment charges and other, net of tax. See the discussion of special items and impairment charges and other above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items and impairment charges and other classifications.
Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and presentations derived from it (per share and growth rate calculations).

Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items and impairment charges and other separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on equity." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items classification. Due to the classification of the Company's former Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment ("PTS") as discontinued operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, the numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes losses of $7.6 million and $24.7 million, respectively, on the sale of PTS recorded, net of tax, in discontinued operations. For the nine months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, the numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes a loss of $7.6 million and a gain of $392.9 million, respectively, on the sale of PTS recorded, net of tax, in discontinued operations. The adjustments related to the PTS sale for each of the three and nine months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 are referred to hereinafter as the "PTS Adjustments."
Non-GAAP return on equity.
Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance. As the Company's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use a financial measure that does not include charges and gains associated with restructuring, merger-related activity and litigation. While these special items may be recurring, management believes that these items are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions, without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business. The PTS Adjustments are excluded for similar reasons.

This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with return on equity (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher or lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance, as well as the PTS tax Adjustments.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on invested capital." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items classification. The numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes interest expense and other because invested capital includes both debt and equity. Due to the classification of the Company's former PTS segment as discontinued operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes the PTS Adjustments.
Non-GAAP return on invested capital.
Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance.

Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance, as well as the PTS Adjustments.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of special items from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items classification. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance because special items may be taxed differently than other items.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that this measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded special items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with effective tax rate from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find this non-GAAP measure useful to evaluate the Company's future performance because special items may have a different tax impact than other items.
 
The Company also presents the non-GAAP financial measure "net debt to capital," which is net debt divided by capital (net debt plus total shareholders' equity). "Net debt," also a non-GAAP financial measure, is debt (the most comparable GAAP measure, calculated as long-term obligations plus short-term borrowings) minus cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale. Management believes that net debt to capital is an important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet. With respect to net debt, cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale are subtracted from the GAAP measure because they could be used to reduce the Company's debt obligations.
Net debt to capital.
The limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale and therefore may imply that there is less Company debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. This limitation is best addressed by using net debt in combination with debt because net debt may be significantly lower than the GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet.
