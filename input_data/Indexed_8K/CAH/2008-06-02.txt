Exhibit 1.1
To the Representative named in Schedule I hereto of the Underwriters named in Schedule II hereto
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          Cardinal Health, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), proposes to issue and sell to the underwriters named in Schedule II hereto (the "Underwriters"), the respective amounts set forth in Schedule II of $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.500% Notes due 2013 (the "Securities"). Banc of America Securities LLC (the "Representative") has agreed to act as the representative of the several Underwriters in connection with the offering and sale of the Securities.
          The Securities will be issued pursuant to an indenture, to be dated on or prior to the Closing Date (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"). If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms "Underwriters" and "Representative," as used herein, shall each be deemed to refer to such firm or firms.
          1. . The Company represents and warrants to each Underwriter that:
Representations and Warranties
     (a) The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on such Form (the file numbers of which are set forth in Schedule I hereto), which has become effective, for the registration under the Act of the Securities. Such registration statement meets the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x) under the Act and complies in all other material respects with said Rule. The Company proposes to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act a supplement to the form of prospectus included in such registration statement relating to the Securities and the plan of distribution thereof and has previously advised you of all further information (financial and other) with respect to the Company to be set forth therein. Such registration statement, including the exhibits thereto, as amended at the date of this Agreement, including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A or 430B under the Act to be part of such registration statement, is hereinafter called the "Registration Statement;" such prospectus in the form in which it appears in the Registration Statement is hereinafter called the "Basic Prospectus;" any such supplemented form of preliminary prospectus relating to the Securities, in the form in which it has been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (including the Basic Prospectus as so supplemented) is hereinafter called a
 
"preliminary prospectus," and such supplemented form of final prospectus relating to the Securities, in the form in which it shall be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (including the Basic Prospectus as so supplemented) is hereinafter called the "Final Prospectus". Any reference herein to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein (the "Incorporated Documents") pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") on or before the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be; and any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Final Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement, or the issue date of the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus or the Final Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.
     (b) At or prior to the time when sales of the Securities were first made (the "Time of Sale"), the Company had prepared the following information (collectively, the "Time of Sale Information"): a preliminary prospectus, dated May 28, 2008 (including the Basic Prospectus) hereinafter called the "Preliminary Prospectus," and each "free-writing prospectus" (as defined pursuant to Rule 405 under the Act) listed on Schedule III hereto.
     (c) As of the Time of Sale, when the Final Prospectus is first filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act, when, prior to the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3 hereof), any amendment to the Registration Statement becomes effective (including the filing of any document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement), when any supplement to the Final Prospectus is filed with the Commission and at the Closing Date, (i) the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, and the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, and the Indenture complied and will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust Indenture Act") and the Exchange Act and the respective rules thereunder and (ii) the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time, did not contain or will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading and the Final Prospectus, as amended or supplemented as of any such time, did not contain or will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to (1) that part of the Registration Statement which constitutes the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act or (2) the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use in the
 
Registration Statement, or the Final Prospectus. No statement of material fact to be included in the Final Prospectus has been omitted from the Time of Sale Information and no statement of material fact included in the Time of Sale Information that is required to be included in the Final Prospectus will be omitted therefrom. No order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the use of any preliminary prospectus or the Final Prospectus has been issued by the Commission.
     (d) Each preliminary prospectus, at the time of filing thereof, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Act. The Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale did not, and at the Closing Date will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to the information contained in or omitted from the Time of Sale Information made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use in such Time of Sale Information.
     (e) Other than the Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, the Company (including its agents and representatives, other than the Underwriters in their capacity as such) has not used, authorized, approved or referred to and will not use, authorize, approve or refer to any "written communication" (as defined in Rule 405 under the Act) that constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy the Securities (each such communication by the Company or its agents and representatives (other than a communication referred to in clause (i) below) an "Issuer Free Writing Prospectus") other than (i) any document not constituting a prospectus pursuant to Section 2(a)(10)(a) of the Act or Rule 134 under the Act or (ii) the documents listed on Schedule III hereto and other written communications approved in writing in advance by the Representative. Each such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus complied in all material respects with the Act, has been filed in accordance with the Act (to the extent required thereby) and, when taken together with the Preliminary Prospectus filed prior to the first use of such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, did not, and at the Closing Date will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to the information contained in or omitted from each such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use in any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
     (f) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, when they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, as applicable, and none of such documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein
 
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and during the period when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (or such delivery is required but for Rule 172 under the Act) any further documents so filed during such period and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, when such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
     (g) The financial statements and the related notes thereto included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, as applicable, and present fairly the financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries as of the dates indicated and the results of their operations and the changes in their cash flows for the periods specified; such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby, and the supporting schedules incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus presents fairly the information required to be stated therein; and the other financial information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus has been derived from the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries and presents fairly the information shown thereby.
     (h) Since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the financial condition, earnings, business, properties or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus.
     (i) The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the State of Ohio with corporate power and authority to own and hold under lease its properties and conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus and holds all material licenses and is duly qualified to conduct the business in which it is engaged in each jurisdiction or place where the conduct of its business requires such licenses or qualification and where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (a "Material Adverse Effect").
 
     (j) Each of the Company's significant subsidiaries (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X) is duly organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation with corporate power and authority to own and hold under lease its properties and to conduct its business as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus;
     (k) The Indenture has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due execution and delivery by the Trustee, is a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to the applicability of general principles of equity. The Indenture conforms in all material respects to the description thereof in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus and has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.
     (l) The Securities have been duly authorized and, when executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the Indenture and delivered to you against payment therefor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will have been validly issued and delivered, and will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject to the applicability of general principles of equity, and the Securities conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus.

     (n) The Company is not in violation of its charter or code of regulations or in default in the performance of any obligation, agreement or condition contained in any bond, debenture, note or any other evidence of indebtedness or in any indenture, material lease or loan agreement, except where any default would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The issue and sale of the Securities, the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the performance of the obligations of the Company set forth herein and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default under, the charter or code of regulations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any agreement, indenture or other instrument to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their property is bound, or any law, administrative regulation or court decree applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, except, where any breach or default would not
 
have a Material Adverse Effect and except where such breach or default would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities.

The Company will use all reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
     (b) (i) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act (or such delivery is required but for Rule 172 under the Act), any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
 
under which they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company will promptly notify the Underwriters thereof and promptly prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such compliance, and (ii) if at any time prior to the Closing Date, any event occurs as a result of which the Time of Sale Information as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Information to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company will promptly notify the Underwriters thereof and promptly prepare and file with the Commission (to the extent required), subject to the first sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 4, and furnish to the Underwriters and to such dealers as the Representative may designate, such amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Information which will correct such statement or omission or which will effect such compliance.

     (d) The Company will furnish to the Representative and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and each amendment thereto which shall become effective on or prior to the Closing Date and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act (or such delivery is required but for Rule 172 under the Act), as many copies of the Final Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as the Representative may reasonably request. The Company will pay the expenses of printing all documents relating to the offering unless otherwise agreed with the Representative.
     (e) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative may reasonably designate and will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to the service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.
     (f) Until the Business Day following the Closing Date, the Company will not, without the prior consent of the Representative, offer, sell, contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of any debt securities of the Company which mature more than one year following the Closing Date and which are substantially similar to the Securities.

Certain Agreements of the Underwriters
          (a) It has not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning for use of, any "free writing prospectus", as defined in Rule 405 under the Act (which term includes use of any written information furnished to the Commission by the Company and not incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and any press release issued by the Company); provided that the Company consents to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that (a) is not an "issuer free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 433 under the Act, and (b) contains only information describing the preliminary terms of the Securities or their offering, or information that describes the final terms of the Securities or their offering and that is included in the Pricing Term Sheet of the Company contemplated on Schedule IV.

          6. . The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities shall be subject to the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the date hereof, as of the effectiveness of any amendment to the Registration Statement filed prior to the Closing Date (including the filing of any document incorporated by reference therein) at the Time of Sale and as of the Closing Date, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

          8. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 11 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally upon demand for all reasonable and detailed out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel as stated with particularity) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.

          9. .
Indemnification and Contribution
          (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus, the Final Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or the Time of Sale Information, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them as such expenses are incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative specifically for use therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
          (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the
 
Representative specifically for use in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 9 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under subsections 9(a) and (b) hereof to the extent it is not prejudiced as a proximate result of such omission. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 9 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel), approved by the Representative in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 9, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent, but if settled with its written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified parties against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional
 
release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount of total underwriting discounts and commissions actually received by it under this Agreement. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
          10. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set

forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriter or Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 10, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
          11. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in any securities of the Company shall have been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange or The Nasdaq National Market shall have been suspended or materially limited, (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared either by Federal or state authorities or a material disruption shall have occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other international or domestic calamity, crisis or change in political, financial or economic conditions, the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, impracticable or inadvisable to offer, sell or deliver the Securities.
Termination
          12. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person affiliated with the Company. Additionally, in connection with the offering of the Securities, neither the Representative nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person affiliated with the Company as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.
No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility
 
          13. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 9 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7, 8 and 9 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive
          14. . All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representative, will be mailed, delivered or telexed and confirmed to it, at the addresses specified in Schedule I hereto; or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telexed and confirmed to it at 7000 Cardinal Place, Dublin, Ohio 43017, Attention: Chief Legal Officer.

The term "successors and assigns" shall not include a purchaser, in its capacity as such, of the Securities from any of the Underwriters.

Exhibit A
     1. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
     2. The Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.

The Securities have been duly executed by the Company and, when authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the Indenture and delivered and paid for as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, the Securities will be the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
     4. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing, with any United States federal or New York governmental authority or regulatory body, is required for the due execution, delivery or performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture or the Securities to which it is a party, except as have been obtained and are in full force and effect under the Act or the Trust Indenture Act or as may be required under the securities and blue sky laws of any jurisdiction in the United States in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities.
     5. The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.
     6. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities to which it is a party do not, and the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby will not, (a) result in a violation of Generally Applicable Law or (b) result in a breach of, a default under or the acceleration of (or entitle any party to accelerate) the maturity of any obligation of the Company under, or result in or require the creation of any lien upon or security interest in any property of the Company pursuant to the terms of the documents listed in the attached schedule.

          (a) each of the documents incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion), at the time it was
Underwriting Agreement
 
Exhibit A
filed with the Commission, appears on its face to have been appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and (b) each of the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1, as to which such counsel expresses no opinion) appears on its face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
          No facts came to such counsel's attention, based upon their participation in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus and any amendments and supplements thereto and upon their review and discussion of the contents thereof, but without independent check or verification except as specified, nothing has come to their attention which would cause such counsel to believe that (i) the Registration Statement (other than the financial statements and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom and the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1, as to which such counsel has not been requested to comment), at the time it became effective or as of the date of the Underwriting Agreement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) the Time of Sale Information (other than the financial statements and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel has not been requested to comment), at the Time of Sale, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii) the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial data contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel has not been requested to comment), as of the date of the Final Prospectus Supplement or the Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 
Exhibit B
     1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Ohio.
     2. Each Significant Subsidiary is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation.
     3. Except for permits and similar authorizations required under the securities or Blue Sky laws of certain jurisdictions (as to which I express no opinion), no consent, approval, authorization or other order of any regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body of or in the State of Ohio is legally required for the valid issuance and sale of the Securities to the Underwriters in the manner contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement.
     4. The Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
     5. There are no legal or governmental proceedings known to me pending or threatened that are required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Final Prospectus that are not described as required, and there is no contract or document known to me of a character required to be described in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Final Prospectus or to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement which is not described or filed as required.
     6. The execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities, compliance by the Company with all provisions thereof and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby do not conflict with or constitute a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or a default under, the certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws or code of regulations of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any agreement, indenture or other instrument known to me which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound which conflict or default would have a Material Adverse Effect, and except where such breach or default would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities, or (assuming compliance with all applicable state securities and Blue Sky laws and without opining as to the enforceability of rights of indemnity or contribution under applicable law) violate any law or administrative regulation of or in the State of Ohio or ruling or court decree known to me applicable to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any of their respective property which violation would have a Material Adverse Effect, and except where such breach or default would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities.
     Based upon my participation in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Final Prospectus and any amendments and supplements thereto
 
Exhibit B
and upon my review and discussion of the contents thereof, nothing has come to my attention which would lead me to believe that the Registration Statement at the time it became effective, including the information, if any, deemed to be part of such Registration Statement at such time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Act, and at the date of the Underwriting Agreement, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, that the Time of Sale Information, at the Time of Sale (which we assume to be the date of the Underwriting Agreement) contained any untrue statement of any material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or that the Final Prospectus (as amended or supplemented, if applicable) as of its date or the Closing Date contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In making the statements in the immediately preceding sentence, I am not expressing any opinion on the financial statements and financial exhibits and other financial data included (or incorporated by reference) therein or omitted therefrom and I am not responsible for the adequacy or accuracy of the derivation or compilation from the Company's accounting records of the financial data included in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Final Prospectus and any amendments or supplements thereto.

     (d) all laws and requirements in respect of the execution and delivery by the Issuer of the Securities have been complied with.
     If all the Securities of any series are not to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate at the time of issuance of each Security, but such Opinion of Counsel and Officers' Certificate, with appropriate modifications, shall be delivered at or before the time of issuance of the first Security of such series.
     The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Securities under this Section if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken by the Issuer or if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors or board of trustees, executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or trustees or Responsible Officers shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing Holders.
     If the Issuer shall establish pursuant to Section 2.3 that the Securities of a series or a portion thereof are to be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities, then the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver one or more Global Securities that (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all of the Securities of such series issued in such form and not yet cancelled, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Security or Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to such Depositary or its custodian or pursuant to such Depositary's instructions and (iv) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive registered form, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary."

Typographical and other minor errors or
Execution of Securities
 
defects in any such reproduction of any such signature shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any Security that has been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.
     In case any officer of the Issuer who shall have executed any of the Securities shall cease to be such officer before the Security so executed shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or disposed of by the Issuer, such Security nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the person who executed such Security had not ceased to be such officer of the Issuer; and any Security may be executed on behalf of the Issuer by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Security, shall be the proper officers of the Issuer, although at the date of the execution and delivery of this Indenture any such person was not such an officer.
     Section 2.6. . Only such Securities as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form hereinbefore recited, executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized officers, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. Such certificate by the Trustee upon any Security executed by the Issuer shall be conclusive evidence that the Security so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Certificate of Authentication
     Section 2.7. . The Securities of each series shall be issuable in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.3. With respect to Securities of any series denominated in Dollars, in the absence of any such provisions with respect to the Securities of such series, the Securities of such series in registered form shall be issued without coupons and shall be issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof, and Securities of such series in bearer form shall be issuable in the denomination of $5,000. The Securities shall be numbered, lettered, or otherwise distinguished in such manner or in accordance with such plan as the officers of the Issuer executing the same may determine with the approval of the Trustee as evidenced by the execution and authentication thereof.
Denomination and Date of Securities; Payments of Interest
     Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication, shall bear interest, if any, from the date and shall be payable on the dates, in each case, which shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.3.
     The person in whose name any Security of any series is registered at the close of business on any record date applicable to a particular series with respect to any interest payment date for such series shall be entitled to receive the interest, if any, payable on such interest payment date notwithstanding any transfer or exchange of such Security subsequent to the record date and prior to such interest payment date, except if and to the extent the Issuer shall default in the payment of the interest due on such interest payment date for such series, in which case such defaulted interest shall be paid to the persons in whose names Outstanding Securities for such series are registered at the close of business on a subsequent record date (which shall be not less than five Business Days prior to the date of payment of such defaulted interest) established by notice given by mail by or on behalf of the Issuer to the holders of Securities not less than 15 days preceding such subsequent record date. The term "record date" as used with respect to any interest payment date (except a date for payment of defaulted interest) shall mean the date
 
specified as such in the terms of the Securities of any particular series, or, if no such date is so specified, if such interest payment date is the first day of a calendar month, the fifteenth day of the next preceding calendar month or, if such interest payment date is the fifteenth day of a calendar month, the first day of such calendar month, whether or not such record date is a Business Day.
     Section 2.8. . The Issuer will keep or cause to be kept at each office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2 a register or registers (a "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it will register, and will register the transfer of, Securities as in this Article provided. Such register shall be in written form in the English language or in any other form capable of being converted into such form within a reasonable time. The Trustee is hereby initially appointed as the "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering the Securities and transfers thereof as herein provided. In the event that the Trustee shall cease to be Security Registrar, it shall have the right to examine the Security Register at all reasonable times.
Registration, Transfer and Exchange
     Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at any such office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Security or Securities of the same series in authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount.
     Any Security or Securities of any series may be exchanged for a Security or Securities of the same series in other authorized denominations, in an equal aggregate principal amount. Securities of any series to be exchanged shall be surrendered at any office or agency to be maintained by the Issuer for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2, and the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the Security or Securities of the same series which the Securityholder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive, bearing numbers not contemporaneously outstanding.
     All Securities presented for registration of transfer, exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so required by the Issuer or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     The Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities. No service charge shall be made for any such transaction.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.8, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive registered form, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
 
     If at any time the Depositary for any Global Securities of any series notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Securities or if at any time the Depositary for such Global Securities shall no longer be eligible under applicable law, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Depositary eligible under applicable law with respect to such Global Securities. If a successor Depositary eligible under applicable law for such Global Securities is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days after the Issuer receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of the Issuer's order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series and tenor, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series and tenor, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Securities, in exchange for such Global Securities.
     The Issuer may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that any Global Securities of any series shall no longer be maintained in global form. In such event the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of the Issuer's order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series and tenor, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series and tenor in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Securities, in exchange for such Global Securities.
     Any time the Securities of any series are not in the form of Global Securities pursuant to the preceding two paragraphs, the Issuer agrees to supply the Trustee with a reasonable supply of certificated Securities without the legend required by Section 2.4 and the Trustee agrees to hold such Securities in safekeeping until authenticated and delivered pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.
     If established by the Issuer pursuant to Section 2.3 with respect to any Global Security, the Depositary for such Global Security may surrender such Global Security in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of the same series and tenor in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Issuer and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge,
     (i) to the Person specified by such Depositary new Securities of the same series and tenor, of any authorized denominations as requested by such Person, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and
     (ii) to such Depositary a new Global Security in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities authenticated and delivered pursuant to clause (i) above.
     Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee or an agent of the Issuer or the Trustee. The Trustee or such agent shall deliver such Securities to or as directed by the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
 
     The Issuer shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for a period of 15 days next preceding the first mailing of notice of redemption of Securities of such series to be redeemed, or (b) any Securities selected, called or being called for redemption except, in the case of any Security where public notice has been given that such Security is to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
     All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
     Section 2.9. . In case any temporary or definitive Security shall become mutilated, defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer in its discretion may execute, and upon the written request of any officer of the Issuer, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Security of the same series, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated or defaced Security, or in lieu of and substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substitute Security shall furnish to the Issuer and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
     Upon the issuance of any substitute Security, the Issuer may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature or has been called for redemption in full shall become mutilated or defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer may instead of issuing a substitute Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security), if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Issuer and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Issuer and the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
     Every substitute Security of any series issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any such Security is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of such series duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced or destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
 
     Section 2.10. . All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, or for credit against any payment in respect of a sinking or analogous fund, if surrendered to the Issuer or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee, shall be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be cancelled by it; and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall destroy cancelled Securities held by it and deliver a certificate of destruction to the Issuer. If the Issuer shall acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Cancellation of Securities; Destruction Thereof
     Section 2.11. . Pending the preparation of definitive Securities for any series, the Issuer may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities for such series (printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced, in each case in form satisfactory to the Trustee). Temporary Securities of any series shall be issuable as registered Securities without coupons, of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities of such series but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Issuer with the concurrence of the Trustee. Temporary Securities may contain such reference to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Security shall be executed by the Issuer and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities. Without unreasonable delay the Issuer shall execute and shall furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge at each office or agency to be maintained by the Issuer for that purpose pursuant to Section 3.2, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities of such series a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.
Temporary Securities
     Section 3.1. . The Issuer covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of, and interest on, each of the Securities of such series at the place or places, at the respective times and in the manner provided in such Securities. Unless otherwise specified in accordance with Section 2.3, each installment of interest on the Securities of any series may be paid by mailing checks for such interest payable to or upon the written order of the holders of Securities entitled thereto as they shall appear on the registry books of the Issuer.
Payment of Principal and Interest

So long as any of the Securities remain outstanding, the Issuer will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities an office or agency (a) where the Securities may be presented for payment, (b) where the Securities may be presented for registration of transfer and for exchange as in this Indenture provided and (c) where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the Securities or of this
Offices for Payments, etc.

Unless otherwise specified in accordance with Section 2.3, the Issuer hereby initially designates the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, as the office to be maintained by it for each such purpose. In case the Issuer shall fail to so designate or maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to give such notice of the location or of any change in the location thereof, presentations and demands may be made and notices may be served at the Corporate Trust Office.
     Section 3.3. . The Issuer, whenever necessary to avoid or fill a vacancy in the office of Trustee, will appoint, in the manner provided in Section 5.9, a Trustee, so that there shall at all times be a Trustee with respect to each series of Securities hereunder.

     (b) that it will give the Trustee notice of any failure by the Issuer (or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) to make any payment of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such series when the same shall be due and payable; and

     If the Issuer shall act as its own paying agent with respect to the Securities of any Series, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such series, set aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Securities of such series a sum sufficient to pay such principal or interest so becoming due.

     For all purposes under this Indenture, if a portion of the principal of any Original Issue Discount Securities shall have been accelerated and declared due and payable pursuant to the provisions hereof, then, from and after such declaration, unless such declaration has been rescinded and annulled, the principal amount of such Original Issue Discount Securities shall be deemed, for all purposes hereunder, to be such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration, and payment of such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration, together with interest, if any, thereon and all other amounts owing thereunder, shall constitute payment in full of such Original Issue Discount Securities.

     Until such demand is made by the Trustee, the Issuer may pay the principal of and interest on the Securities of any series to the registered holders, whether or not the principal of and interest on the Securities of such series be overdue.
     In case the Issuer shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceedings to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Issuer or other obligor upon such Securities and collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Issuer or other obligor upon such Securities, wherever situated, the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable.
     In case there shall be pending proceedings relative to the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Securities under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken possession of the Issuer or its property or such other obligor, or in case of any other comparable judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer or other obligor upon the Securities of any series, or to the creditors or property of the Issuer or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of any Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise:
     (a) to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal and interest (or, if the Securities of any series are Original Issue Discount Securities or Indexed Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of such series) owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities of any series, and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for reasonable compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and for reimbursement of all expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, except as a result of negligence or bad faith) and of the Securityholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer or other obligor upon the Securities of any series, or to the creditors or property of the Issuer or such other obligor,
     (b) unless prohibited by applicable law and regulations, to vote on behalf of the holders of the Securities of any series in any election of a trustee or a standby trustee in arrangement, reorganization, liquidation or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or person performing similar functions in comparable proceedings, and
     (c) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute all amounts received with respect to the claims of the Securityholders and of the Trustee on their behalf; and any trustee, receiver, or liquidator, custodian or other similar official is hereby authorized by each of the Securityholders to make payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall
 
consent to the making of payments directly to the Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the Trustee, each predecessor Trustee and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee except as a result of negligence or bad faith and all other amounts due to the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee pursuant to Section 5.6.
     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of any series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding except, as aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee or a standby trustee in arrangement, reorganization, liquidation or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or person performing similar functions in comparable proceedings.
     All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the Securities, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any trial or other proceedings relative thereto, and any such action or proceedings instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject to the payment of the expenses, disbursements and compensation of the Trustee, each predecessor Trustee and their respective agents and attorneys, shall be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Securities in respect of which such action was taken.
     In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and also any proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee shall be held to represent all the holders of the Securities in respect to which such action was taken, and it shall not be necessary to make any holders of such Securities parties to any such proceedings.
     Section 4.3. . Any moneys collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article in respect of any series shall be applied in the following order at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such moneys on account of principal or interest, upon presentation of the Securities in respect of which monies have been collected and stamping (or otherwise noting) thereon the payment, or issuing Securities of such series in reduced principal amounts in exchange for the presented Securities of like series if only partially paid, or upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

     SECOND: In case the principal of the Securities of such series in respect of which moneys have been collected shall not have become and be then due and payable, to

     THIRD: In case the principal of the Securities of such series in respect of which moneys have been collected shall have become and shall be then due and payable, to the payment of the whole amount then owing and unpaid upon all the Securities of such series for principal and interest, with interest upon the overdue principal, and (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon overdue installments of interest at the same rate as the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) specified in the Securities of such series; and in case such moneys shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amount so due and unpaid upon the Securities of such series, then to the payment of such principal and interest or yield to maturity, without preference or priority of principal over interest or yield to maturity, or of interest or yield to maturity over principal, or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Security of such series over any other Security of such series, ratably to the aggregate of such principal and accrued and unpaid interest or yield to maturity; and
     FOURTH: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Issuer or any other person lawfully entitled thereto.
     Section 4.4. .

Suits for Enforcement
     Section 4.5. . In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Issuer and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Securityholders shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken.
Restoration of Rights on Abandonment of Proceedings
     Section 4.6. . No holder of any Security of any series shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any action or proceeding at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise upon or under or with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (1) such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default and of the
Limitations on Suits by Securityholders
 
continuance thereof; (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action or proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as trustee hereunder; (3) such Holder or Holders shall have offered to the Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby; and (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall have failed to institute any such action or proceeding; and (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee by the Holders during such 60-day period pursuant to Section 4.9; it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker and Holder of every Security with every other taker and Holder and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders of Securities of any series shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other such Holder of Securities, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such Holder or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Holders of Securities of the applicable series. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section, each and every Securityholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity.
     Section 4.7. . Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture and any provision of any Security, the right of any Holder of any Security to receive payment of the principal of and interest on such Security on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.
Unconditional Right of Securityholders to Institute Certain Suits
     Section 4.8. . Except as provided in Section 4.6, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Securityholders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Powers and Remedies Cumulative; Delay or Omission Not Waiver of Default
     No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Securityholder to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and, subject to Section 4.6, every power and remedy given by this Indenture or by law to the Trustee or to the Securityholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Securityholders.
     Section 4.9. . The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series affected (with each series voting as a separate class) at the time outstanding shall have the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by this Indenture; that such direction shall not be otherwise than in accordance with law and the
Control by Securityholders
provided
 
provisions of this Indenture and that (subject to the provisions of Section 5.1) the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, shall determine that the action or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or responsible officers of the Trustee shall determine that the action or proceedings so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability or if the Trustee in good faith shall so determine that the actions or forbearances specified in or pursuant to such direction would be unduly prejudicial to the interests of Holders of the Securities of all series so affected not joining in the giving of said direction, it being understood that (subject to Section 5.1) the Trustee shall have no duty to ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such Holders.
provided
further

     Section 4.10. . Prior to a declaration of the acceleration of the maturity of the Securities of any series as provided in Section 4.1, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series at the time Outstanding (each such series voting as a separate class) may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past default or Event of Default described in clause (d) or (g) of Section 4.1 which relates to less than all series of Securities then Outstanding, except a default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each Holder affected as provided in Section 7.2. Prior to a declaration of acceleration of the maturity of the Securities of any series as provided in Section 4.1, the Holders of Securities of a majority in principal amount of all the Securities then Outstanding (voting as one class) may on behalf of all Holders waive any past default or Event of Default referred to in said clause (d) or (g) which relates to all series of Securities then Outstanding, or described in clause (e) or (f) of Section 4.1, except a default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected as provided in Section 7.2. In the case of any such waiver, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities of each series affected shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively.
Waiver of Past Defaults
     Upon any such waiver, any such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     Section 4.11. . The Trustee shall give to the Securityholders of any series, as the names and addresses of such Holders appear on the Security Register, notice by mail of all Defaults known to the Trustee which have occurred with respect to such series, such notice to be transmitted within 90 days after the occurrence thereof, unless such Defaults shall have been cured before the giving of such notice; that, except in the case of Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any of the Securities of such series, or in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund installment with respect to the Securities of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive

provided
 
committee, or a trust committee of directors or trustees and/or responsible officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Securityholders of such series.
     Section 4.12. . All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Securityholder or group of Securityholders of any series holding in the aggregate more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series, or, in the case of any suit relating to or arising under clauses (d) or (g) of Section 4.1 (if the suit relates to Securities of more than one but less than all series), 10% in aggregate principal amount of Securities Outstanding affected thereby, or in the case of any suit relating to or arising under clauses (d) or (g) (if the suit relates to all the Securities then Outstanding), or (e) or (f) of Section 4.1, 10% in aggregate principal amount of all Securities Outstanding, or to any suit instituted by any Securityholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security on or after the due date expressed in such Security.
Right of Court to Require Filing of Undertaking to Pay Costs
     Section 4.13. . The Issuer covenants (to the extent it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and the Issuer (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws
     Section 5.1. . With respect to the Holders of any series of Securities issued hereunder, the Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a particular series and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default which may have occurred with respect to such series, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. In case an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a series has occurred (which has not been cured or waived) the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.
Duties and Responsibilities of the Trustee; During Default; Prior to Default
 
     No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that
     (a) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default with respect to such series which may have occurred:
     (i) the duties and obligations of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
     (ii) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any statements, certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such statements, certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture;
     (b) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
     (c) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the holders pursuant to Section 4.9 relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture.
     None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there shall be reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such liability is not reasonably assured to it.
     The provisions of this Section 5.1 are in furtherance of and subject to Sections 315 and 316 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
     Section 5.2. . In furtherance of and subject to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and subject to Section 5.1:

     (d) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the trusts or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Securityholders pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Securityholders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred therein or thereby;
     (e) the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion, rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture;
     (f) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default, the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, approval, appraisal, bond, debenture, note, coupon, security, or other paper or document unless requested in writing so to do by the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series affected then outstanding; that, if the payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Trustee may require reasonable indemnity against such expenses or liabilities as a condition to proceeding; the reasonable expenses of every such investigation shall be paid by the Issuer or, if paid by the Trustee or any predecessor trustee, shall be repaid by the Issuer upon demand;
provided
     (g) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys not regularly in its employ and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder; and
     (h) except for the Defaults set forth in Section 4.1(a), (b) and (c), the Trustee will not have knowledge of a Default unless notified thereof.
 
     Section 5.3. . The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Issuer, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the same. The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Issuer of any of the Securities or of the proceeds thereof.
Trustee Not Responsible for Recitals, Disposition of Securities or Application of Proceeds Thereof
     Section 5.4. The Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee or such agent and may otherwise deal with the Issuer and receive, collect, hold and retain collections from the Issuer with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee or such agent.
Trustee and Agents May Hold Securities; Collections, etc.
     Section 5.5. . Subject to the provisions of Section 9.4 hereof, all moneys received by the Trustee shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for which they were received, but need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by mandatory provisions of law. Neither the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be under any liability for interest on any moneys received by it hereunder.
Moneys Held by Trustee
     Section 5.6. . The Issuer covenants and agrees to pay to the Trustee from time to time, and the Trustee shall be entitled to, reasonable compensation (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust) and the Issuer covenants and agrees to pay or reimburse the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by or on behalf of it in accordance with any of the provisions of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its counsel and of all agents and other persons not regularly in its employ) except to the extent any such expense, disbursement or advance may arise from its negligence or bad faith. The Issuer also covenants to indemnify the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this Indenture or the trusts hereunder and the performance of its duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against or investigating any claim of liability in the premises, except to the extent such loss, liability or expense is due to the negligence or bad faith of the Trustee or such predecessor Trustee. The obligations of the Issuer under this Section to compensate and indemnify the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee for expenses, disbursements and advances shall constitute additional indebtedness hereunder and shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture. Such additional indebtedness shall be a senior claim to that of the Securities upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the benefit of the holders of particular Securities, and the Securities are hereby subordinated to such senior claim.
Compensation and Indemnification of Trustee and Its Prior Claim
     Section 5.7. Subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.2, whenever in the administration of the trusts of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem
Right of Trustee to Rely on Officers' Certificate, etc.
 
it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering or omitting any action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee, and such certificate, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof.

If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of a Federal, State or District of Columbia supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.
Persons Eligible for Appointment as Trustee
     Section 5.9. . (a) The Trustee, or any trustee or trustees hereafter appointed, may at any time resign with respect to one or more or all series of Securities by giving written notice of resignation to the Issuer and by mailing notice thereof by first class mail to Holders of the applicable series of Securities at their last addresses as they shall appear on the Security Register. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor trustee or trustees with respect to the applicable series by written instrument in duplicate, executed by authority of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee or trustees. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed with respect to any series and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation, the resigning trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee, or any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of the applicable series for at least six months may, subject to the provisions of Section 4.12, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.
Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor Trustee
          (b) In case at any time any of the following shall occur:
     (i) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 with respect to any series of Securities after written request therefor by the Issuer or by any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months; or
     (ii) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Issuer or by any Securityholder; or
     (iii) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting with respect to any series of Securities, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver or liquidator of the
 
Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation; then, in any such case, the Issuer may remove the Trustee with respect to the applicable series of Securities and appoint a successor trustee for such series by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to Section 315(e) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months may on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor trustee with respect to such series. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee.
          (c) The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee with respect to Securities of such series and appoint a successor trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by delivering to the Trustee so removed, to the successor trustee so appointed and to the Issuer the evidence provided for in Section 6.1 of the action in that regard taken by the Securityholders.
          (d) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee with respect to any series and any appointment of a successor trustee with respect to such series pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 5.9 shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 5.10.
     Section 5.10. . Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 5.9 shall execute and deliver to the Issuer and to its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor trustee with respect to all or any applicable series shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and obligations with respect to such series of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as trustee for such series hereunder; but, nevertheless, on the written request of the Issuer or of the successor trustee, upon payment of its charges then unpaid, the trustee ceasing to act shall, subject to Section 9.4, pay over to the successor trustee all moneys at the time held by it hereunder and shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations. Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Issuer shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers. Any trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a prior claim upon all property or funds held or collected by such trustee to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.6.
Acceptance of Appointment by Successor Trustee
     If a successor trustee is appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Issuer, the predecessor Trustee and each successor trustee with respect to the Securities of any applicable series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto which shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all
 
the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the predecessor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series as to which the predecessor Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the predecessor Trustee, and shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts under separate indentures.
     Upon acceptance of appointment by any successor trustee as provided in this Section 5.10, the Issuer shall mail notice thereof by first-class mail to the Holders of Securities of any series for which such successor trustee is acting as trustee at their last addresses as they shall appear in the Security Register. If the acceptance of appointment is substantially contemporaneous with the resignation, then the notice called for by the preceding sentence may be combined with the notice called for by Section 5.9. If the Issuer fails to mail such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Issuer.
     Section 5.11. . Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, that such corporation shall be eligible under the provisions of Section 5.8, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business of Trustee
provided
     In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Securities of any series shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee and deliver such Securities so authenticated; and, in case at that time any of the Securities of any series shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor Trustee; and in all such cases such certificate shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities of such series or in this Indenture that the certificate of the Trustee shall have; that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee or to authenticate Securities of any series in the name of any predecessor Trustee shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.
provided
provided
     Section 5.12. . At any time when any of the Securities remain Outstanding, the Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents which may be an Affiliate or Affiliates of the Issuer with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series and the Trustee shall give written notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, in the manner provided for in Section 10.4. Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Any such appointment shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing signed by a
Appointment of Authenticating Agent
 
Responsible Officer of the Trustee, and a copy of such instrument shall be promptly furnished to the Issuer. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Issuer and shall at all times be a bank or trust company or corporation organized and doing business and in good standing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
     Any Person into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such Person shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
     An Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee for such series and to the Issuer. The Trustee for any series of Securities may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Issuer. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee for such series may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Issuer and shall promptly give written notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, in the manner provided for in Section 10.4. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
     The Issuer agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.
     If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in the following form:

     Section 6.1. . Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by a specified percentage in principal amount of the Securityholders of any or all series may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such specified percentage of Securityholders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee. Proof of execution of any instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.2) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this Article.
Evidence of Action Taken by Securityholders
     Section 6.2. . Subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.2, the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder or his agent or proxy may be proved in accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Trustee or in such manner as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee. The holding of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register or by a certificate of the Security Registrar. The Issuer may set a record date for purposes of determining the identity of holders of Securities of any series entitled to vote or consent to any action referred to in Section 6.1, which record date may be set at any time or from time to time by notice to the Trustee, for any date or dates (in the case of any adjournment or reconsideration) not more than 60 days nor less than five days prior to the proposed date of such vote or consent, and thereafter, notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, only holders of Securities of such series of record on such record date shall be entitled to so vote or give such consent or revoke such vote or consent.
Proof of Execution of Instruments and of Holding of Securities; Record Date
     Section 6.3. . The Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may deem and treat the person in whose name any Security shall be registered upon the Security Register for such series as the absolute owner of such Security
Holders to be Treated as Owners
 
(whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of and, subject to the provisions of this Indenture, interest on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to any such person, or upon his order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys payable upon any such Security.
     No Holder of any beneficial interest in any Global Security held on its behalf by a Depositary shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to such Global Security, and such Depositary may be treated by the Issuer, the Trustee, and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee as the owner of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, any paying agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
     Section 6.4. . In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any or all series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, Securities which are owned by the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver only Securities which the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Securities or any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities. In case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of counsel shall be full protection in respect of any decision made by the Trustee in accordance with such advice. Upon request of the Trustee, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officers' Certificate listing and identifying all Securities, if any, known by the Issuer to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above-described persons; and, subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.2, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officers' Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.
Securities Owned by Issuer Deemed Not Outstanding
     Section 6.5. . At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 6.1, of the taking of any action by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any Holder of a Security the serial number of which is shown by the evidence to be included among the serial numbers of the Securities the Holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice at the Corporate Trust Office and upon proof of holding as provided in this
Right of Revocation of Action Taken
 
Article, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the Holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such Security and of any Securities issued in exchange or substitution therefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security. Any action taken by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders of all the Securities affected by such action.

     (c) to add to the covenants of the Issuer such further covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions as its Board of Directors and the Trustee shall consider to be for the protection of the Holders of Securities, and to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and continuance, of a Default in any such additional covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions an Event of Default permitting the enforcement of all or any of the several remedies provided in this Indenture as herein set forth; that in respect of any such additional covenant, restriction, condition or provision such supplemental indenture may provide for a particular period of grace after Default (which period may be shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of other Defaults) or may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such an Event of Default or may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such an Event of Default or may limit the right of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series to waive such an Event of Default;
provided
     (d) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture; or to make such other provisions in regard to matters or questions arising under this Indenture or under any supplemental indenture as the Board of Directors may deem necessary or desirable and

     The Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Issuer in the execution of any such supplemental indenture, to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations which may be therein contained and to accept the conveyance, transfer, assignment, mortgage or pledge of any property thereunder, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.

     It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Securityholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
     A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture, which shall have been included expressly and solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.

Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by
 
Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
     In case, by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service, it shall be impracticable to mail notice to the Issuer and Securityholders when such notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice.

Upon any application or demand by the Issuer to the Trustee to take any action under any of the provisions of this Indenture, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with and an Opinion of Counsel stating that in the opinion of such counsel all such conditions precedent have been complied with, except that in the case of any such application or demand as to which the furnishing of such documents is specifically required by any provision of this Indenture relating to such particular application or demand, no additional certificate or opinion need be furnished.
Officers' Certificates and Opinions of Counsel; Statements to Be Contained Therein

     Any certificate, statement or opinion of an officer of the Issuer may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by counsel, unless such officer knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous. Any certificate, statement or opinion of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, information with respect to which is in the possession of the Issuer, upon the certificate, statement or opinion of or representations by an officer of officers of the Issuer, unless such counsel knows that the certificate, statement or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous.
     Any certificate, statement or opinion of an officer of the Issuer or of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to accounting matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by an accountant or firm of accountants in the employ of the Issuer, unless such officer or counsel, as the case may be, knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the accounting matters upon which his certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous.
 
     Any certificate or opinion of any independent firm of public accountants filed with the Trustee shall contain a statement that such firm is independent.
     Section 10.6. . If the date of maturity of interest on or principal of the Securities of any series or the date fixed for redemption or repayment of any such Security shall not be a Business Day, then payment of interest or principal need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date of maturity or the date fixed for redemption, and no interest shall accrue for the period after such date.

Conflict of Any Provision of Indenture with Trust Indenture Act of 1939
incorporated provision
     Section 10.8. . This Indenture and each Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
Governing Law
     Section 10.9. . This Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original; but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
     Section 10.10. . The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.
Effect of Headings
     Section 11.1. . The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to the Securities of any series which are redeemable before their maturity or to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3 for Securities of such series.
Applicability of Article
     Section 11.2. . Notice of redemption to the Holders of Securities of any series to be redeemed as a whole or in part at the option of the Issuer shall be given by mailing notice of such redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to such Holders of Securities of such series at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the registry books. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Failure to give notice by mail, or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such series.
Notice of Redemption; Partial Redemptions
     The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall specify the principal amount of each Security of such series held by such Holder to be redeemed, the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price, the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation
 
and surrender of such Securities, that such redemption is pursuant to the mandatory or optional sinking fund, or both, if such be the case, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice and that on and after said date interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. In case any Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
     The notice of redemption of Securities of any series to be redeemed at the option of the Issuer shall be given by the Issuer or, at the Issuer's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuer.
     On or prior to the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section, the Issuer will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents (or, if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 3.4) an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities of such series so called for redemption at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption.
     If less than all of the outstanding Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Issuer shall at least 45 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) notify the Trustee of the date fixed for redemption and the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be redeemed. If less than all of the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, Securities of such Series to be redeemed in whole or in part. Securities may be redeemed in part in multiples equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such series or any multiple thereof. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Securities of such series selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities of such series selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities of any series shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
     Section 11.3. . If notice of redemption has been given as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Issuer shall default in the payment of such. Securities at the redemption price, together with interest accrued to said date) interest on the Securities or portions of Securities so called for redemption shall cease to accrue and, except as provided in Sections 5.5 and 9.4, such Securities shall cease from and after the date fixed for redemption to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Indenture, and the Holders thereof shall have no right in respect of such Securities except the right to receive the redemption price thereof and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a place of payment specified in said notice, said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Issuer at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued
Payment of Securities Called for Redemption
 
thereon to the date fixed for redemption; that any semiannual payment of interest becoming due on the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities registered as such on the relevant record date subject to the terms and provisions of Section 2.4 hereof.
provided
     If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of an Original Issue Discount Security) borne by the Security.
     Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Issuer, a new Security or Securities of such series, of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.
     Section 11.4. . Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for selection for redemption if they are identified by registration and certificate number in a written statement signed by an authorized officer of the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee at least 40 days prior to the last date on which notice of redemption may be given as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by either (a) the Issuer or (b) an entity specifically identified in such written statement directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer.
Exclusion of Certain Securities from Eligibility for Selection for Redemption
     Section 11.5. . The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". The date on which a sinking fund payment is to be made is herein referred to as the "sinking fund payment date".
Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds
     In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any series of Securities in cash, the Issuer may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of such series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except upon redemption pursuant to the mandatory sinking fund) by the Issuer or receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except as aforesaid) by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.7, (b) receive credit for optional sinking fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section, or (c) receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) redeemed by the Issuer through any optional redemption provision contained in the terms of such series. Securities so delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustee at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Securities.
     On or before the sixtieth day next preceding each sinking fund payment date for any series, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee a written statement (which need not contain the statements required by Section 10.5) signed by an authorized officer of the Issuer (a) specifying the portion of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by payment of cash and the
 
portion to be satisfied by credit of Securities of such series, (b) stating that none of the Securities of such series has theretofore been so credited, (c) stating that no defaults in the payment of interest or Events of Default with respect to such series have occurred (which have not been waived or cured) and are continuing and (d) stating whether or not the Issuer intends to exercise its right to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series and, if so, specifying the amount of such optional sinking fund payment which the Issuer intends to pay on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Any Securities of such series to be credited and required to be delivered to the Trustee in order for the Issuer to be entitled to credit therefor as aforesaid which have not theretofore been delivered to the Trustee shall be delivered for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10 to the Trustee with such written statement (or reasonably promptly thereafter if acceptable to the Trustee). Such written statement shall be irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustee the Issuer shall become unconditionally obligated to make all the cash payments or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Issuer, on or before any such sixtieth day, to deliver such written statement and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable election of the Issuer (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Issuer will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section.
     If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $50,000 (or a lesser sum if the Issuer shall so request) with respect to the Securities of any particular series, such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $50,000 or less and the Issuer makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $50,000 is available. The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 11.2, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date a sufficient principal amount of Securities of such series to absorb said cash, as nearly as may be, and shall (if requested in writing by the Issuer) inform the Issuer of the serial numbers of the Securities of such series (or portions thereof) so selected. Securities of any series which are (a) owned by the Issuer or an entity known by the Trustee to be directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer, as shown by the Security Register, and not known to the Trustee to have been pledged or hypothecated by the Issuer or any such entity or (b) identified in an Officers' Certificate at least 60 days prior to the sinking fund payment date as being beneficially owned by, and not pledged or hypothecated by, the Issuer or an entity directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer shall be excluded from Securities of such series eligible for selection for redemption. The Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Issuer (or the Issuer, if it shall so request the Trustee in writing) shall cause notice of redemption of the Securities of such series to be given in substantially the manner provided in Section 11.2 (and with the effect provided in Section 11.3) for the redemption of Securities of such series in part at the option of the Issuer. The amount of any sinking fund payments not so applied or allocated to the redemption of Securities of such series shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment for such series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the
 
provisions of this Section. Any and all sinking fund moneys held on the stated maturity date of the Securities of any particular series (or earlier, if such maturity is accelerated), which are not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series shall be applied, together with other moneys, if necessary, sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, the Securities of such series at maturity.
     At least one Business Day before each sinking fund payment date, the Issuer shall pay to the Trustee in cash or shall otherwise provide for the payment of all interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption on Securities to be redeemed on the next following sinking fund payment date.
     The Trustee shall not redeem or cause to be redeemed any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of Securities for such series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a Default in payment of interest on such Securities or of any Event of Default except that, where the mailing of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, that it shall have received from the Issuer a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such Default or Event of Default shall occur, and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking fund, shall, during the continuance of such Default or Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article Four and held for the payment of all such Securities. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 4.9 or the Default cured on or before the sixtieth day preceding the sinking fund payment date in any year, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this Section to the redemption of such Securities.
provided
     Section 12.1. . Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3 for Securities of any series, the provisions of this Article Twelve shall apply to each series of Securities, and the Issuer may, at its option, effect defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under Section 12.2, or covenant defeasance of or within a series under Section 12.3 in accordance with the terms of such Securities and in accordance with this Article.
Issuer's Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance
     Section 12.2. . Upon the Issuer's exercise of the above option applicable to this Section with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Issuer shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Outstanding Securities on the date the conditions set forth in Section 12.4 are satisfied (hereinafter, "defeasance"). For this purpose, such defeasance means that the Issuer shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Outstanding Securities, which shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 12.5 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (A) and (B) below, and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Issuer, shall execute proper instruments
Defeasance and Discharge
 
acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (A) the rights of Holders of such Outstanding Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 12.4 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and interest, if any, on such Securities when such payments are due, (B) the Issuer's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 3.2 and 3.4 and such obligations as shall be ancillary thereto, (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder including, without limitation, Section 5.6 and the penultimate paragraph of Section 12.5 and (D) this Article Twelve. Subject to compliance with this Article Twelve, the Issuer may exercise its option under this Section 12.2 notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option under Section 12.3 with respect to such Securities.
     Section 12.3. . Upon the Issuer's exercise of the above option applicable to this Section with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Issuer shall be released from its obligations under Sections 8.1 and 8.2 and Sections 3.5, 3.7, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 and, if specified pursuant to Section 2.3, its obligations under any other covenant, with respect to such Outstanding Securities on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 12.4 are satisfied (hereinafter, "covenant defeasance"), and such Securities shall thereafter be deemed not to be "Outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration or other acts of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other purposes hereunder. For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to such Outstanding Securities, the Issuer may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 4.1(d) or Section 4.1(g) or otherwise, as the case may be, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.
Covenant Defeasance
     Section 12.4. . The following shall be the conditions to application of either Section 12.2 or Section 12.3 to any Outstanding Securities of or within a series:
Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance
     (a) The Issuer shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee satisfying the requirements of Section 5.8 who shall agree to comply with the provisions of this Article Twelve applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, (A) money in an amount or (B) equivalent in securities of the government which issued the currency in which the Securities are denominated or government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of such government ("Government Obligations") which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, on or prior to the due date of any payment of principal of and premium, if any, and interest, if any, under such Securities, money in an amount, or (C) a combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay
 
and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge, (i) the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Outstanding Securities due at maturity (or on a redemption date, if applicable), and (ii) any mandatory sinking fund payments or analogous payments applicable to such Outstanding Securities on the day on which such payments are due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and of such Securities; provided that the Trustee shall have been irrevocably instructed to apply such money or the proceeds of such Government Obligations to said payments with respect to such Securities. Before such a deposit, the Issuer may give to the Trustee, in accordance with Section 11.2 hereof, a notice of its election to redeem all or any portion of such Outstanding Securities at a future date in accordance with the terms of the Securities of such series and Article Eleven hereof, which notice shall be irrevocable. Such irrevocable redemption notice, if given, shall be given effect in applying the foregoing.
     (b) No Default or Event of Default with respect to such Securities shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit or, insofar as Sections 4.1(e) and 4.1(f) are concerned, at any time during the period ending on the 91st day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period).
     (c) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than this Indenture) to which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is bound.
     (d) In the case of an election under Section 12.2, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (x) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (y) since the date of execution of this Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of such Outstanding Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and such defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit and such defeasance had not occurred.
     (e) In the case of an election under Section 12.3, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Outstanding Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit and such covenant defeasance had not occurred.
     (f) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall be effected in compliance with and additional or substitute terms, conditions or limitations in connection therewith pursuant to Section 2.3.
 
     (g) The Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to either the defeasance under Section 12.2 or the covenant defeasance under Section 12.3 (as the case may be) have been complied with.
     Section 12.5. . Subject to the provisions of Section 9.4, all money and Government Obligations (or other property as may be provided pursuant to Section 2.3) (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 12.5, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 12.4 in respect of such Outstanding Securities shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any paying agent (including the Issuer acting as its own paying agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
Deposited Money and Government Obligations to Be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions
     The Issuer shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 12.4 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of such Outstanding Securities. The foregoing sentence shall survive the termination of this Indenture and the earlier resignation or removal of the Trustee.
     Anything in this Article Twelve to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Issuer from time to time upon Company Order any money or Government Obligations (or other property and any proceeds therefrom) held by it as provided in Section 12.4 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent defeasance or covenant defeasance, as applicable, in accordance with this Article.
     Section 12.6. . If the Trustee or any paying agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with Section 12.5 with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Issuer's obligations under this Indenture and such Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 12.2 or 12.3, as the case may be, until such time as the Trustee or paying agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 12.5; provided, however, that if the Issuer makes any payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any such Security or following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or paying agent.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION
          This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein and referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
          This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes, bonds or other evidences of indebtedness of the Issuer (hereinafter called the "") of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an indenture dated as of June 2, 2008 (herein called the ""), duly executed and delivered by the Issuer to The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the ""), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Holders of the Securities. The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions (if any), may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds (if any) and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided.

          In case an Event of Default with respect to the Notes, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

2.
Amendment; Supplement; Waiver
          The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in the aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series to be affected (voting as one class), evidenced as provided in the Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each such series; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the final maturity of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or any premium thereon, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any interest thereon, or reduce or
 
impair or affect the rights of any Holder to institute suit for the payment thereof or any right of repayment at the option of the Holder, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected. It is also provided in the Indenture that, with respect to certain defaults or Events of Default regarding the Securities of any series, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of such Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount Outstanding of the Securities of such series (or, in the case of certain defaults or Events of Default, all or certain series of the Securities) may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series (or all or certain series of the Securities, as the case may be) waive any such past default or Event of Default and its consequences. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes.
3.
Optional Redemption
          The Notes are redeemable, in whole or, from time to time, in part, at the option of the Issuer at any time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:
          (1) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, or
          (2) as determined by a Quotation Agent, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate plus 35 basis points,
plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the amount of the Notes being redeemed to the date of redemption.
"Adjusted Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by a Quotation Agent as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining terms of such Notes.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of three Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date,
 
after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than three such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Quotation Agent" means the Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by the Issuer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) Bank of America, N.A. and its respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the Issuer shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Issuer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Issuer, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the third Business Day preceding such redemption date.
          Notice to holders of Notes to be redeemed will be delivered by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. Unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, the Notes to be redeemed in whole or in part.
4.
Repurchase at the Option of Holders Upon a Change of Control
          Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event, unless all Notes have been called for redemption pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Note, each Holder of the Notes shall have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment").
          Within 30 days following any Change of Control Repurchase Event or, at the Issuer's option, prior to any proposed Change of Control, but after the public announcement of the proposed Change of Control, the Issuer shall mail, or cause to be mailed, a notice (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute or may constitute the Change of Control Repurchase Event and shall specify, without limitation, the following:
          (1) that the Change of Control Offer is being made and that all Notes tendered will be accepted for payment;
 
          (2) the Change of Control Payment and the purchase date, which shall be a Business Day no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date");
          (3) the CUSIP numbers for the Notes;
          (4) that any Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest;
          (5) that, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment Date;
          (6) that Holders whose Notes of any series are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes of such series equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion will be equal to $2,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof; and
          (7) if the notice is mailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control, that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control Repurchase Event occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.
          The Issuer shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change in Control Repurchase Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions hereof, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder by virtue of such conflict.
          On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:
          (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;
          (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and
          (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes so accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the Issuer.
          The Paying Agent shall promptly mail to each Holder of Notes of each series properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new Note of the same series equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
 
          The Issuer shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth herein applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.
          "Below Investment Grade Rating Event" means the Notes are rated below Investment Grade by each of the Rating Agencies on any date from the date of the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control until the end of the 60-day period following public notice of the occurrence of a Change of Control (which period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade by any of the Rating Agencies).
          "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than the Issuer or one of its subsidiaries; (2) the consummation of any transaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any "person" (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Issuer's Voting Stock, measured by voting power rather than number of shares; or (3) the first day on which a majority of the members of the Issuer's Board of Directors cease to be Continuing Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control if (i) the Issuer becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company and (ii) the holders of the Voting Stock of such holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of Voting Stock immediately prior to that transaction.
          "Change of Control Repurchase Event" means the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Below Investment Grade Rating Event.
          "Continuing Directors" means, as of any date of determination, members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer who (1) were members of such Board of Directors on the date of the issuance of the Notes; or (2) were nominated for election or elected or appointed to such Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of such Board of Directors at the time of such nomination or election or appointment.

under any successor rating categories of S&P); or the equivalent investment grade credit rating from any additional Rating Agency or Rating Agencies selected by the Issuer.
          "Rating Agency" means (i) each of Fitch, Moody's and S&P; and (ii) if any of Fitch, Moody's or S&P ceases to rate the notes or fails to make a rating of the notes publicly available for reasons outside of the Issuer's control, a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act, or any successor definition, selected by the Issuer as a replacement agency for Fitch, Moody's or S&P, or all of them, as the case may be.
          "Securities Act" means the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which term, when used herein, includes the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
