Cardinal Health, a global provider of products and services that improve the safety and productivity of health care, today reported an increase in fiscal 2008 revenue of 5 percent to $91 billion and a 76 percent increase in GAAP earnings per share to $3.64. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS grew 11 percent to $3.80

for the year.
As the company had forecasted, the medical supply chain segment improved profit in the second half of the year, driven by double-digit growth in its core U.S. medical distribution business. Significant steps were taken in the pharmaceutical distribution business during the year to accelerate a recovery, which the company expects in the second half of fiscal 2009.
Results during the quarter and year continued to highlight growth within the company's medical technology segments. Combined revenue for the Clinical Technologies and Services and Medical Products and Technologies segments grew by 24 percent to $5.6 billion and profit increased 36 percent to nearly $800 million for the year.
Cardinal Health also announced that its board of directors has supported a management recommendation to actively explore a potential separation of the company's primary operating and reporting segments, which could involve a tax-free spin-off of the clinical and medical products

businesses as a separate, publicly traded company. Cardinal Health plans to announce its decision within approximately 60 to 90 days.
"For two years, we have been taking steps to sharpen our focus on healthcare supply chain services and clinical and medical products, culminating with our announcement in July to operate these businesses in two distinct segments that reflect the unique characteristics and requirements of each," said R. Kerry Clark, chairman and chief executive officer of Cardinal Health. "As we now consider a spin-off of our clinical and medical products businesses, our goal is simple: to have two thriving businesses, delivering maximum value to customers and shareholders over the long term."
Fiscal 2008 Results
Consolidated revenue for fiscal 2008 grew 5 percent to $91 billion and GAAP earnings from continuing operations rose 58 percent to $1.3 billion. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 76 percent to $3.64, or 11 percent to $3.80 on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings in the prior year were negatively affected by a $600 million expense to resolve securities litigation.
During the fourth quarter, ended June 30, consolidated revenue increased 3 percent to $23 billion and earnings from continuing operations increased 39 percent to $330 million. Earnings in the fourth quarter of the prior year were dampened by merger-related charges from the company's acquisition of VIASYS Healthcare. Excluding the impact of merger charges and other items, non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations increased 1 percent to $348 million

, or 9 percent to $0.97 on a diluted per-share basis.
"Overall, fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations," Clark said. "We continued to demonstrate to customers the value of our clinically differentiated medical technologies, where we delivered a year of very strong growth on the top and bottom lines. We also made steady progress throughout the year in our medical supply chain segment and, in particular, are very pleased with the results in our hospital, lab and ambulatory care distribution business.
"In our pharmaceutical supply chain segment, we believe we are on the right path to resolve the license suspensions that have kept us from distributing controlled substances from three of our 24 distribution centers. This will be a critical step in our efforts to drive improvements in the business. And while we won't speculate on the ultimate outcome, we are in constructive settlement discussions with the DEA and have recorded a reserve of $23.5 million in connection with those discussions. We have made good progress in enhancing our controls and are eager to return to full service levels for our customers."
Q4 and FY08 Summary

Fourth-quarter and full-year segment results
Revenue for the segment increased 1 percent to $19.8 billion for the quarter with sales to bulk customers increasing by 9 percent. Sales to non-bulk customers decreased by 5 percent, primarily due to the transfer of volume from non-bulk to bulk sales by a large customer and the loss of business associated with controlled substance anti-diversion efforts. As expected, segment profit declined 15 percent to $258 million, driven by previously disclosed customer re-pricings, and direct-store-door customer losses, including the impact of anti-diversion efforts. The profit decline was partially offset by branded pharmaceutical price increases and greater profit from distribution service agreement fees.
Healthcare Supply Chain Services  Pharmaceutical
For the year, segment revenue reached $79.3 billion, an increase of 4 percent, and segment profit was $1.1 billion, declining 14 percent from last year.
Fourth-quarter revenue for the segment increased 8 percent to $2.1 billion, driven by increased sales to existing hospital, laboratory and ambulatory customers. Segment profit for the quarter decreased 3 percent to $81 million, but included a previously disclosed corporate allocation adjustment that reduced profit by 6 percentage points. Strong, double-digit profit growth from the distribution of medical and surgical products in the U.S. partially offset the decline in segment profit from other factors. As the company had forecasted, segment profit grew in the second half of fiscal 2008 compared to the second half of fiscal 2007.
Healthcare Supply Chain Services  Medical
Full-year revenue for the segment increased 8 percent to $8.1 billion, and full-year profit declined 5 percent to $303 million.
The segment reported a 46 percent increase in fourth-quarter revenue to $727 million, primarily driven by the acquisitions of VIASYS Healthcare and Enturia, but also organic growth in the core infection prevention and respiratory businesses. Segment profit increased 63 percent to $95 million and included a favorable impact of 38 percentage points from acquisitions. During the quarter, the company discovered it had failed to recognize profit on a portion of intercompany sales from fiscal 2006 to 2008. As a result, approximately $16 million was recorded as income for the fourth quarter that pertained to prior periods. The VIASYS integration continues to be ahead of schedule to achieve planned synergy goals by 2010.
Medical Products and Technologies
For the full year, segment revenue increased 47 percent to $2.7 billion and segment profit grew 52 percent to $300 million, including 39 percentage points from acquisitions.
Compared to a record quarter in the prior year, fourth-quarter revenue for the segment increased 3 percent to $780 million, driven by continued strength in installations of medication dispensing products. Excluding Pharmacy Services, revenue increased 9 percent. Segment profit for the quarter exceeded company expectations, rising 8 percent to $156 million driven by favorable product mix and a positive impact from foreign exchange.
Clinical Technologies and Services
Full-year revenue for the segment increased 8 percent to $2.9 billion and segment profit increased 29 percent to $497 million.
Additional fourth-quarter and recent highlights include:

Outlook
"In fiscal 2009, we plan to make incremental investments of up to $100 million to strengthen R&D in the clinical and medical products business and improve information technology in the supply chain services business," Clark said. "These investments will affect our earnings growth rates in fiscal 2009, but are important, foundational moves that we believe will accelerate future growth in both segments."
For fiscal 2009, the company expects revenue growth of 6 to 7 percent. Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in a range of $3.80 to $3.95 based on investments the company plans to make in new product development and information technology, and previously disclosed challenges in the pharmaceutical distribution business that are expected to continue through the first half of the fiscal year, coupled with a particularly unfavorable comparison in the first quarter due to strong branded price inflation in the prior year period.
As a result, non-GAAP EPS in the first quarter is expected to be around $0.70. The company forecasts EPS to return to more normal levels in the second quarter, with overall company results stronger in the second half of the year.

The Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment is expected to return to profitable growth in the second half of the year. The first half of the year will continue to be affected by the company's ability to resolve license suspensions to distribute controlled substances from three of its pharmaceutical distribution centers, previously disclosed repricing of some major contracts and volatility in the Nuclear Pharmacy Services business leading to the launch of generic sestimibi.
The Clinical and Medical Products segment is expected to continue on a strong growth trajectory based on momentum in current product lines and approximately 50 new product introductions or enhancements planned during the next 18 months.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations and effective tax rate from continuing operations. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast special items and impairment charges and other, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.

Exhibit 99.2
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), Cardinal Health, Inc.'s (the "Company's") earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company has provided reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measures. Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental metrics to assist readers. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings release.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP operating earnings" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items and impairment charges and other.
Non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation).
The Company classifies restructuring charges, acquisition integration charges and certain litigation and other items as special items. A restructuring activity is a program whereby the Company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing facilities, moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re-alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. Restructuring charges include employee-related costs, facility exit and other costs and asset impairments.
Acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate acquired companies. Acquisition integration charges include employee-related costs, asset impairments and other exit costs, in-process research and development costs and other integration costs.
The Company recognizes income from the favorable outcome of legal settlements, judgments or other resolution of legal and regulatory matters as special items on the consolidated financial statements when the associated cash or assets are received. Generally, expenses due to the unfavorable outcome of legal settlements, judgments or other resolution of legal and regulatory matters ("litigation settlement losses") are charged to the segment to which the matter relates and, as a result, are classified as selling, general and administrative expense on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In certain circumstances, significant litigation settlement losses are classified in special items on the consolidated statement of earnings. Factors considered in determining whether a particular litigation settlement loss should be classified in special items include the nature of the matter (i.e., significant matters that are infrequent, non-recurring or unusual in nature are classified as special items), the age of the matter and the pervasiveness of the matter to the entire organization. The Company also classifies legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the previously-disclosed SEC investigation and related Audit Committee internal review and related matters as special items.
Asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets not eligible to be classified as special items or discontinued operations are classified within impairment charges and other within the consolidated statements of earnings.
For further discussion of items classified as special items and impairment charges and other, see the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's Annual and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
Management uses non-GAAP operating earnings to evaluate the Company's performance. As the Company's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry,
management finds it useful to use financial measures that do not include charges and gains associated with restructuring activities, integrating acquisitions, significant litigation settlements, asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets. While these special items and impairment charges and other may be recurring, management believes that these items and charges are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions, without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that the measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with operating earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items and impairment charges and other separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, and impairment charges and other, net of tax. See the discussion of special items and impairment charges and other above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items and impairment charges and other classifications.

Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items and impairment charges and other separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on equity." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items classification. Due to the classification of the Company's former Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment ("PTS") as discontinued operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, for the three months ended June 30, 2007, the numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes a gain of $679.5 million on the sale of PTS recorded, net of tax, in discontinued operations. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, the numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes a loss of $7.6 million and a gain of $1,072.4 million, respectively, on the sale of PTS recorded, net of tax, in discontinued operations. The adjustments related to the PTS sale for each of the three months ended June 30, 2007 and the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 are referred to hereinafter as the "PTS Adjustments."

The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on invested capital." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items classification. The numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes interest expense and other, net of tax, because invested capital includes both debt and equity. Due to the classification of the Company's former PTS segment as discontinued operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes the PTS Adjustments.

Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance, as well as the PTS Adjustments.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of special items from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items classification. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance because special items may be taxed differently than other items.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations.
 
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that this measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded special items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with effective tax rate from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find this non-GAAP measure useful to evaluate the Company's future performance because special items may have a different tax impact than other items.
The Company also presents the non-GAAP financial measure "net debt to capital," which is net debt divided by capital (net debt plus total shareholders' equity). "Net debt," also a non-GAAP financial measure, is debt (the most comparable GAAP measure, calculated as long-term obligations plus short-term borrowings) minus cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale. Management believes that net debt to capital is an important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet. With respect to net debt, cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale are subtracted from the GAAP measure because they could be used to reduce the Company's debt obligations.
Net debt to capital.
The limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale and therefore may imply that there is less Company debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. This limitation is best addressed by using net debt in combination with debt because net debt may be lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measures "Clinical Technologies and Services segment and Medical Products and Technologies segment combined revenue and segment profit" and presentations derived from them. These non-GAAP financial measures are calculated by adding together revenue and segment profit for each segment as reported in the notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. Information about interest income and expense and income taxes is not provided at the segment level. In addition, special items, impairment charges and other and costs associated with certain strategic investments that require the approval of executive management are not allocated to the segments. Further, segment profit does not reflect the elimination of revenue and profit on inter-segment sales.
Clinical Technologies and Services segment and Medical Products and Technologies segment combined revenue and segment profit and presentations derived from them (growth rate calculations).
Management uses these non-GAAP measures to monitor the operating performance of the Clinical and Medical Products sector and compare their results with other businesses with similar operations. The businesses within the Clinical and Medical Products sector have revenue and profit characteristics that contrast with the high revenue and low margin characteristics of the Company's businesses comprising the Healthcare Supply Chain Services sector.
The limitation associated with using these non-GAAP measures is that these measures are not necessarily representative of the financial results that would have been obtained if the businesses had been operated as a single segment and do not represent the financial results that will be obtained under the new Clinical and Medical Products reportable segment. This limitation is best addressed by evaluating these non-GAAP measures on a historical basis and in combination with Clinical Technologies and Services segment revenue and segment profit and Medical Products and Technologies segment revenue and segment profit (the most comparable GAAP measures). Management believes that investors may find these non-GAAP measures useful to evaluate the Company's performance on a sector basis comprising businesses that have revenue and profit characteristics that contrast with the high revenue and low margin characteristics of the Company's businesses comprising the Healthcare Supply Chain Services sector.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "Clinical Technologies and Services segment revenue growth rate excluding Pharmacy Services revenue." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes revenue from this segment's Pharmacy Services business that provides outsourced hospital pharmacy management services. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the revenue growth trends of the higher growth businesses within the Clinical Technologies and Services segment. Although the Pharmacy Services business constitutes a
Clinical Technologies and Services segment revenue growth rate excluding Pharmacy Services revenue.
 
substantial percentage of this segment's revenue, it is more mature and slower growing than the segment's other businesses and its results may obscure revenue trends in other businesses within this segment. Thus, management finds it useful to exclude Pharmacy Services revenue when reviewing revenue growth and trends for the segment.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that it is not representative of revenue and revenue growth for the entire Clinical Technologies and Services segment. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with Clinical Technologies and Services segment revenue (the most comparable GAAP measure). Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate Clinical Technologies and Services revenue excluding Pharmacy Services revenue when reviewing the segment's performance because its revenue may obscure revenue trends in other businesses within this segment.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations and effective tax rate from continuing operations. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast special items and impairment charges and other, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.
