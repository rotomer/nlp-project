 Cardinal Health, a global provider of products and services that improve the safety and productivity of health care, today reported an 11 percent increase in revenue to $24 billion, driven by strong sales in the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment and continued growth within Clinical and Medical Products.
DUBLIN, Ohio, Oct. 29, 2008
For the quarter ended Sept. 30, the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment achieved double-digit revenue growth, which helped partially offset the expected year-over-year profit decline from previously disclosed contract re-pricings and anti-diversion efforts for controlled substances.
First-quarter GAAP earnings per share (EPS) declined 16 percent from the prior year period to $0.69. Special items primarily related to the restructuring announced on July 8 and impairments resulted in a $0.05 dilutive impact, bringing non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations
1
to $0.74.
In early October, Cardinal Health entered into an agreement with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to resume shipments of controlled substances from three of the company's distribution centers, which is anticipated to contribute to growth in the second half of the fiscal year. The company expects these facilities to fully resume shipment of controlled substances by the end of November.
"The company performed as expected with double-digit revenue and profit performance from Clinical and Medical Products, and I am encouraged by continued signs of early progress in the

pharmaceutical supply chain business," said R. Kerry Clark, chairman and CEO of Cardinal Health. "We remain focused on driving growth for both segments, while working diligently toward completing the spin-off of our clinical and medical products businesses by the middle of calendar 2009."
The company announced on Sept. 29 that its board of directors had approved plans for a tax-free spin-off of most of its clinical and medical products businesses as a separate, publicly traded company. Completion of the spin-off is subject to final approval by the company's board of directors, confirmation of the tax-free nature of the transaction and the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Q1 FY09 SUMMARY
 
FIRST-QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS
Healthcare Supply Chain Services
 
Healthcare Supply Chain Services increased revenue by 11 percent to $23.4 billion, from sales to both pharmaceutical and medical supply chain customers. Sales to bulk customers
4
increased 20 percent to $10.7 billion and sales to non-bulk customers
5
increased 4 percent to $10.6 billion. Segment profit declined 16 percent to $292 million, primarily driven by previously disclosed pharmaceutical contract re-pricings, continued disruption from anti-diversion efforts for pharmaceutical supply chain customers and lower branded price inflation compared to the prior year period.
"In the pharmaceutical supply chain business, we made significant progress towards our key priorities, including rebuilding sales momentum, particularly in the direct store business, growth in

our Source Generics program and a resolution with the DEA related to the distribution of controlled drugs," said George Barrett, Cardinal Health vice chairman and CEO of Healthcare Supply Chain Services. "While the positive financial impact of this progress will not be felt immediately, each represents an important milestone in turning the business in a positive direction. Other highlights from the segment include our lab and ambulatory businesses within the medical products supply chain. They performed particularly well for the quarter, and we expect to continue this momentum for the remainder of the fiscal year."
Clinical and Medical Products
 
Revenue for Clinical and Medical Products increased 12 percent to $1.2 billion, driven by continued strength in dispensing, the Enturia acquisition and international sales. Segment profit increased 15 percent to $167 million, driven by the increase in revenue and growth in infection prevention products, including Enturia. Segment profit was partially dampened by a rise in raw material costs.
"Our core infusion and dispensing systems performed well, and our ChloraPrep products from the Enturia acquisition outperformed for the quarter," said David Schlotterbeck, Cardinal Health vice chairman and CEO of Clinical and Medical Products. "As we continue to make progress with our quality system enhancements, we have essentially completed remediation efforts for the Alaris SE pump recall and expect to complete the Alaris System Pump Module recall by the end of the calendar year. In addition, the VIASYS acquisition remains on schedule to meet our synergy targets for fiscal 2010."
ADDITIONAL FIRST QUARTER AND RECENT HIGHLIGHTS:
 
 
 
 
 
 
OUTLOOK
Cardinal Health's guidance range for the full year remains unchanged at $3.80 to $3.95 for non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations. Clark said, "It is clear that we are operating in an
 
Cardinal Health News
Page 4 of 5
 
unprecedented economic environment, yet Cardinal Health remains well positioned with a strong balance sheet that enables ongoing access to capital. While we have not seen any definitive customer credit issues that would change our full-year outlook at this time, we are seeing hospitals delay some purchase decisions that will have some impact to our Clinical and Medical Products segment for the December quarter. We are monitoring this very closely and will continue to take steps to mitigate as much impact as possible."
The company's guidance does not reflect any incremental costs it will incur associated with the spin-off and separation of the two companies. The company expects a significant portion of these costs will be classified as special items in accordance with company practices.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations and effective tax rate from continuing operations. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.

Exhibit 99.2
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), Cardinal Health, Inc.'s (the "Company's") earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company has provided reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measures. Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental metrics to assist readers. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings release.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP operating earnings" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net.
Non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation).
The Company classifies restructuring charges, acquisition integration charges and certain litigation and other items as special items. A restructuring activity is a program whereby the Company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing facilities, moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re-alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. Restructuring charges are recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." Under SFAS No. 146, a liability is measured at its fair value and recognized as incurred.
Acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate acquired companies. Upon acquisition, certain integration charges are included within the purchase price allocation in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and other integration charges are recognized as special items as incurred.
The Company recognizes income from the favorable outcome of legal settlements, judgments or other resolution of legal and regulatory matters as special items on the consolidated financial statements when the associated cash or assets are received. Generally, expenses due to the unfavorable outcome of legal settlements, judgments or other resolution of legal and regulatory matters ("litigation settlement losses") are charged to the segment to which the matter relates and, as a result, are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In certain circumstances, significant litigation settlement losses are classified in special items on the consolidated statement of earnings. Factors considered in determining whether a particular litigation settlement loss should be classified in special items include the size of settlement, the nature of the matter (i.e., significant matters that are infrequent, non-recurring or unusual in nature are classified as special items), the age of the matter and the pervasiveness of the matter to the entire organization. The Company also classifies legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the previously-disclosed SEC investigation and related Audit Committee internal review and related matters as special items. For information regarding these investigations, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, as amended.
The Company classifies certain asset impairments related to restructurings in special items. Asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets not eligible to be classified as special items or discontinued operations are classified within impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net within the consolidated statements of earnings.
For further discussion of items classified as special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net, see the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's Annual and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
Management uses non-GAAP operating earnings to evaluate the Company's performance. As the Company's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use financial measures that do not include charges and gains associated with restructuring activities, integrating acquisitions, significant litigation settlements, asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets. While these special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net may be recurring, management believes that these items and charges are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions, without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that the measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with operating earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance.

The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations."

Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance because special items may be taxed differently than other items.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that this measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded special items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with effective tax rate from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find this non-GAAP measure useful to evaluate the Company's future performance because special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net may have a different tax impact than other items.
 
The Company also presents the non-GAAP financial measure "net debt to capital," which is net debt divided by capital (net debt plus total shareholders' equity). "Net debt," also a non-GAAP financial measure, is debt (the most comparable GAAP measure, calculated as long-term obligations plus short-term borrowings) minus cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale. Management believes that net debt to capital is an important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet. With respect to net debt, cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale are subtracted from the GAAP measure because they could be used to reduce the Company's debt obligations.
Net debt to capital.
The limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale and therefore may imply that there is less Company debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. This limitation is best addressed by using net debt in combination with debt because net debt may be lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet.
