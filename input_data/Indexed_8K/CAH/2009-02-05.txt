 Cardinal Health, a global provider of products and services that improve the safety and productivity of health care, today reported solid fiscal second quarter results driven by top- and bottom-line growth from its supply chain and medical product segments.
DUBLIN, Ohio, Feb. 5, 2009
For the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2008, revenue grew 8 percent to $25 billion, and non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations
1
increased 2 percent to $335 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations declined 1 percent to $0.88. The impact of special items, impairments and other costs associated with the proposed spinoff of Clinical and Medical Products (CMP) totaled $16 million after tax or $0.05 per share, bringing non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations
2
to $0.93, a 3 percent increase over the prior-year period.
"Despite a very challenging economic climate, we had solid growth from both of our primary operating segments," said R. Kerry Clark, chairman and chief executive officer of Cardinal Health. "HSCS returned to year over year segment profit growth in the second quarter, and we expect to remain on track with positive growth for the second half of the fiscal year. CMP continued its track record of double-digit segment profit growth, though we continue to see the deferral in hospital spending affecting its performance for the remainder of the fiscal year. We are reaffirming our full-year guidance, adjusted on Jan. 8, of non-GAAP EPS of $3.50 to $3.60. In addition, we remain on track to spin off the CMP businesses later this year and intend to file the Form 10 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission during our fiscal third quarter."

Q2 FY09 SUMMARY
 
SECOND-QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS
Healthcare Supply Chain Services
Healthcare Supply Chain Services increased revenue by 8 percent to $24.1 billion, driven by higher sales to existing pharmaceutical and medical supply chain customers. Sales to bulk pharmaceutical customers
4
increased 15 percent to $11 billion and sales to non-bulk pharmaceutical customers
5
increased 2 percent to $11 billion. Segment profit grew 6 percent to $333 million, primarily from an increased contribution from generic sales, inflation from branded pharmaceuticals, the increase in total segment sales volume and growth from nuclear pharmacy services. Segment profit growth was partially dampened by previously reported pharmaceutical contract re-pricings and continued disruption from anti-diversion efforts for pharmaceutical supply chain customers. During the quarter, the company resumed shipments of controlled substances from all distribution centers.
"We built upon the momentum from the first quarter and returned the segment to growth during the quarter, with solid contributions from both the pharmaceutical and medical supply chain businesses," said George Barrett, Cardinal Health vice chairman and chief executive officer of Healthcare Supply Chain Services. "In addition to the pharmaceutical distribution business, our nuclear pharmacy services and hospital supply businesses performed very well in the quarter with strong profit growth. We remain on track to achieve our goals for fiscal 2009."

Clinical and Medical Products
Revenue for Clinical and Medical Products increased 7 percent to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by organic growth from the dispensing, infusion and infection prevention businesses and the Enturia acquisition. Segment revenue was dampened by 3 percentage points due to foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Segment profit increased 16 percent to $198 million, driven by revenue growth, the Enturia acquisition and disciplined expense control. Segment profit was significantly dampened by foreign exchange rates and increased raw material costs.
"We continue to see remarkable growth from the Enturia acquisition, and continued top- and bottom-line growth in infusion and dispensing during the quarter," said David Schlotterbeck, Cardinal Health vice chairman and chief executive officer of Clinical and Medical Products. "Despite a strong second quarter, we continue to expect full-year segment profit to be flat or better because of the delay in hospital capital spending that is expected to impact the second half of our fiscal year."

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations and effective tax rate from continuing operations. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast special items, impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net and Other Spin-Off Costs, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.

Exhibit 99.2
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), Cardinal Health, Inc.'s (the "Company's") earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company has provided reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measures. Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental metrics to assist readers. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings release.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP operating earnings" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net.
Non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation).
The Company classifies restructuring charges, acquisition integration charges and certain litigation and other items as special items. A restructuring activity is a program whereby the Company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing facilities, moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re-alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. Restructuring charges are recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." Under SFAS No. 146, a liability is measured at its fair value and recognized as incurred.
Acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate acquired companies. Upon acquisition, certain integration charges are included within the purchase price allocation in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and other integration charges are recognized as special items as incurred.
The Company recognizes income from the favorable outcome of legal settlements, judgments or other resolution of legal and regulatory matters as special items on the consolidated financial statements when the associated cash or assets are received. Generally, expenses due to the unfavorable outcome of legal settlements, judgments or other resolution of legal and regulatory matters ("litigation settlement losses") are charged to the segment to which the matter relates and, as a result, are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In certain circumstances, significant litigation settlement losses are classified in special items on the consolidated statement of earnings. Factors considered in determining whether a particular litigation settlement loss should be classified in special items include the size of settlement, the nature of the matter (i.e., significant matters that are infrequent, non-recurring or unusual in nature are classified as special items), the age of the matter and the pervasiveness of the matter to the entire organization. The Company also classifies legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the previously-disclosed SEC investigation and related Audit Committee internal review and related matters as special items. For information regarding these investigations, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, as amended.
The Company classifies certain asset impairments related to restructurings in special items. Asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets not eligible to be classified as special items or discontinued operations are classified within impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net within the consolidated statements of earnings.
For further discussion of items classified as special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net, see the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's Annual and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
On September 29, 2008, the Company announced that it plans to spin off most of its clinical and medical products businesses from its remaining businesses through a pro rata distribution to the Company's shareholders (the "Planned Spin-Off"). Beginning the second quarter of fiscal 2009, this non-GAAP measure also excludes costs incurred in connection with the Planned Spin-Off that are not included in special items or impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net. These costs are referred to hereinafter as the "Other Spin-Off Costs."
Management uses non-GAAP operating earnings to evaluate the Company's performance. As the Company's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use financial measures that do not include charges and gains associated with restructuring activities, integrating acquisitions, significant litigation settlements, asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets. While these special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net may be recurring, management believes that these items and charges are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions, without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business. The Other Spin-Off Costs are excluded for similar reasons.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that the measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with operating earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance, as well as the Other Spin-Off Costs.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net, net of tax. See the discussion of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net classifications. Beginning the second quarter of fiscal 2009, this non-GAAP measure also excludes the Other Spin-Off Costs, net of tax.

The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on equity." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net classifications. Beginning the second quarter of fiscal 2009, this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes the Other Spin-Off Costs, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation.

The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on invested capital." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net classifications. Beginning the second quarter of fiscal 2009, non-GAAP financial measure also excludes the Other Spin-Off Costs, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation.
Non-GAAP return on invested capital.
Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance. As the Company's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use financial measures that do not include charges and gains associated with restructuring activities, integrating acquisitions, significant litigation settlements, asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets.

The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that this measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with return on invested capital (the most comparable
 
GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance, as well as the Other Spin-Off Costs.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net classifications. Beginning the second quarter of fiscal 2009, this non-GAAP financial measure excludes the Other Spin-Off Costs from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of the Other Spin-Off Costs from the numerator of the calculation. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance because special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net may be taxed differently than other items. The Other Spin-Off Costs are excluded for similar reasons.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that this measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with effective tax rate from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find this non-GAAP measure useful to evaluate the Company's future performance because special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net may have a different tax impact than other items, as well as the Other Spin-Off Costs.
The Company also presents the non-GAAP financial measure "net debt to capital," which is net debt divided by capital (net debt plus total shareholders' equity). "Net debt," also a non-GAAP financial measure, is debt (the most comparable GAAP measure, calculated as long-term obligations plus short-term borrowings) minus cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale. Management believes that net debt to capital is an important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet. With respect to net debt, cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale are subtracted from the GAAP measure because they could be used to reduce the Company's debt obligations.
Net debt to capital.
The limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale and therefore may imply that there is less Company debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. This limitation is best addressed by using net debt in combination with debt because net debt may be lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet.
