Cardinal Health, a global provider of products and services that improve the safety and productivity of health care, today reported solid revenue growth for its fiscal third quarter and an expected decline in earnings, primarily due to a previously disclosed deferral in hospital capital spending.
DUBLIN, Ohio, April 30, 2009
Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, rose 9 percent to $24.9 billion, driven by sales growth from the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment. Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations
1
declined 10 percent to $350 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations
2
decreased 10 percent to $0.97 from the prior year period. Including the $36 million after tax or $0.10 per share impact of special items, impairments and other costs associated with the planned spinoff of CareFusion Corporation, GAAP earnings from continuing operations were $314 million or $0.87 per share.
The year-over-year earnings decline was primarily driven by a deferral in hospital capital spending affecting the company's Clinical and Medical Products segment, an additional reserve associated with the costs to remediate certain models of the company's Alaris infusion pump products, the negative impact on sales from a hold on shipping certain Alaris products and the negative effect of foreign exchange rates. The earnings decline was partially offset by a lower tax rate, due to a tax refund claim filed during the quarter.
"The revenue and profit growth from the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment in this economic downturn is encouraging," said R. Kerry Clark, Cardinal Health chairman and chief executive officer. "We knew we were going to have a difficult quarter in our Clinical and Medical
Cardinal Health News

Products segment, but we remain in a strong, long-term competitive position and made progress during the quarter against some of our short-term challenges, which gives us confidence as we move towards completing the planned spinoff."
Q3 FY09 SUMMARY
 
THIRD-QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS
Healthcare Supply Chain Services
Healthcare Supply Chain Services increased revenue by 9 percent to $24 billion, driven by higher sales to existing pharmaceutical supply chain customers. Sales to bulk pharmaceutical customers
4
increased 19 percent to $10.8 billion and sales to non-bulk pharmaceutical customers
5
increased 3 percent to $11.1 billion. Segment profit increased 2 percent to $384 million due to the total segment sales growth, strong performance in nuclear pharmacy services and disciplined management of operating expenses. Segment profit growth was partially offset by the impact of customer mix and higher bad debt expense.
"With solid revenue growth from our pharmaceutical distribution business and profit growth from nuclear pharmacy services and medical product distribution, the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment held up well in the fiscal third quarter in the face of a very challenging environment," said George Barrett, Cardinal Health vice chairman and chief executive officer of Healthcare Supply Chain Services. "The segment remains focused on revitalizing our core businesses and providing the tools that allow our customers to thrive in this dynamic health care environment."

Clinical and Medical Products
Revenue for Clinical and Medical Products decreased 6 percent to $1.1 billion, driven by sales declines from the previously disclosed deferral in hospital capital spending, the ship-hold on certain Alaris products and the impact of foreign exchange rates. The decline in segment revenue was partially offset by revenue growth in the infection prevention businesses, primarily from the Enturia acquisition. Segment profit declined 22 percent to $148 million, driven by the revenue decline, a reserve associated with remediation efforts for IV pumps, the ship-hold on certain Alaris products and the impact of foreign exchange rates. The infusion remediation reserve included a $6 million charge announced on March 12 associated with the Alaris PCA module recall and an additional $12 million associated with a corrective action plan submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 24, bringing the total fiscal third quarter remediation reserve to $18 million. Foreign exchange rates negatively affected segment profit by 8 percentage points. The negative factors affecting segment profit were partially offset by growth from the infection prevention business, including the Enturia acquisition that favorably affected segment profit by 9 percentage points, and growth from infusion and respiratory disposable products.
"The overall trends in our Clinical and Medical Products segment remain fundamentally the same, with our capital equipment businesses being affected by the deferral in capital spending and our businesses related to disposables continuing to perform well," said David Schlotterbeck, Cardinal Health vice chairman and chief executive officer of Clinical and Medical Products. "The complicating factor in the quarter was our recall and ship-hold on some of our infusion products, but we are making progress against our obligations under the amended consent decree with the FDA. In addition, we had another strong quarter from the Enturia acquisition, which continues to perform very well."
 
ADDITIONAL THIRD QUARTER AND RECENT HIGHLIGHTS:

OUTLOOK
Clark said, "Even with the additional impact from the infusion remediation reserve and the ship-hold, we are maintaining our full-year non-GAAP EPS outlook within, but at the low end of, our guidance range of $3.50 to $3.60 per share."
The company's guidance does not reflect any incremental costs it will incur associated with the planned spinoff and separation of the two companies. The company expects a significant portion of these costs to be classified as special items in accordance with current company practices.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations and effective tax rate from continuing operations. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast special items, impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net and other spin-off costs, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.

Exhibit 99.2
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), Cardinal Health, Inc.'s (the "Company's") earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company has provided reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measures. Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental metrics to assist readers. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings release.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP operating earnings" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net.
Non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation).
The Company classifies restructuring charges, acquisition integration charges and certain litigation and other items as special items. A restructuring activity is a program whereby the Company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing facilities, moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re-alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. Restructuring charges are recorded in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." Under SFAS No. 146, a liability is measured at its fair value and recognized as incurred.
Acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate acquired companies. Upon acquisition, certain integration charges are included within the purchase price allocation in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and other integration charges are recognized as special items as incurred.
The Company recognizes income from the favorable outcome of legal settlements, judgments or other resolution of legal and regulatory matters as special items on the consolidated financial statements when the associated cash or assets are received. Generally, expenses due to the unfavorable outcome of legal settlements, judgments or other resolution of legal and regulatory matters ("litigation settlement losses") are charged to the segment to which the matter relates and, as a result, are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company's consolidated financial statements. In certain circumstances, significant litigation settlement losses are classified in special items on the consolidated statement of earnings. Factors considered in determining whether a particular litigation settlement loss should be classified in special items include the size of settlement, the nature of the matter (i.e., significant matters that are infrequent, non-recurring or unusual in nature are classified as special items), the age of the matter and the pervasiveness of the matter to the entire organization. The Company also classifies legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the previously-disclosed SEC investigation and related Audit Committee internal review and related matters as special items. For information regarding these investigations, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, as amended.
The Company classifies certain asset impairments related to restructurings in special items. Asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets not eligible to be classified as special items or discontinued operations are classified within impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net within the consolidated statements of earnings.
For further discussion of items classified as special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net, see the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's Annual and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
On September 29, 2008, the Company announced that it intended to separate its clinical and medical products businesses from its other businesses, including its healthcare supply chain services business, through a spin-off of a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, CareFusion Corporation, formed for the purpose of holding the clinical and medical products businesses (the "Planned Spin-Off"). Beginning the second quarter of fiscal 2009, this non-GAAP measure also excludes costs incurred in connection with the Planned Spin-Off that are not included in special items or impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net. These costs are referred to hereinafter as the "Other Spin-Off Costs."
Management uses non-GAAP operating earnings to evaluate the Company's performance. As the Company's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use financial measures that do not include charges and gains associated with restructuring activities, integrating acquisitions, significant litigation settlements, asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets. While these special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net may be recurring, management believes that these items and charges are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions, without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business. The Other Spin-Off Costs are excluded for similar reasons.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that the measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with operating earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net separately and in the aggregate when reviewing the Company's performance, as well as the Other Spin-Off Costs.

The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on equity." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net classifications.

Beginning the second quarter of fiscal 2009, non-GAAP financial measure also excludes the Other Spin-Off Costs, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation.
Non-GAAP return on invested capital.
Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance.

The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that this measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company.

The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of the Company's special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net classifications. Beginning the second quarter of fiscal 2009, this non-GAAP financial measure excludes the Other Spin-Off Costs from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of the Other Spin-Off Costs from the numerator of the calculation. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate the Company's performance because special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net may be taxed differently than other items. The Other Spin-Off Costs are excluded for similar reasons.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that this measure excludes items that impact the Company's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with effective tax rate from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find this non-GAAP measure useful to evaluate the Company's future performance because special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net may have a different tax impact than other items, as well as the Other Spin-Off Costs.
The Company also presents the non-GAAP financial measure "net debt to capital," which is net debt divided by capital (net debt plus total shareholders' equity). "Net debt," also a non-GAAP financial measure, is debt (the most comparable GAAP measure, calculated as long-term obligations plus short-term borrowings) minus cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale. Management believes that net debt to capital is an important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet. With respect to net debt, cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale are subtracted from the GAAP measure because they could be used to reduce the Company's debt obligations.
Net debt to capital.
The limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale and therefore may imply that there is less Company debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. This limitation is best addressed by using net debt in combination with debt because net debt may be lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations and effective tax rate from continuing operations. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast special items, impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net and other spin-off costs, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.
