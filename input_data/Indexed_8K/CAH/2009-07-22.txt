As previously announced, on July 14, 2009, CareFusion Corporation ("CareFusion"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardinal Health, Inc. ("Cardinal Health"), entered into a Purchase Agreement dated July 14, 2009 (the "Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which it agreed to sell $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2012 (the "2012 Notes"), $450 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2014 (the "2014 Notes") and $700 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.375% senior notes due 2019 (the "2019 Notes", and together with the 2012 Notes and the 2014 Notes, the "Notes") to the initial purchasers named in the Purchase Agreement (the "Initial Purchasers").
The closing of the sale of the Notes occurred on July 21, 2009. The proceeds from the offering after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discount but before other offering expenses are estimated to be approximately $1.374 billion. The offer and sale of the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. CareFusion offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers will sell the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act and in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. CareFusion relied on these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement.
The Notes are governed by an Indenture dated as of July 21, 2009 between CareFusion and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated July 21, 2009 (the "Indenture").
The 2012 Notes will mature on August 1, 2012, the 2014 Notes will mature on August 1, 2014 and the 2019 Notes will mature on August 1, 2019. In each case, interest will be paid on each February 1 and August 1, commencing February 1, 2010.
CareFusion may redeem the Notes prior to maturity, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to its present value, on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at an adjusted treasury rate plus 45 basis points in the case of the 2012 Notes, 45 basis points in the case of the 2014 Notes and 50 basis points in the case of the 2019 Notes, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the amount being redeemed to the date of redemption. In addition, if CareFusion undergoes a change of control and experiences a below investment grade rating event, each as defined in the Notes, CareFusion may be required to repurchase all of the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to the date of repurchase.
CareFusion expects to use the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to pay a special dividend to Cardinal Health in connection with Cardinal Health's planned spin-off of CareFusion through the distribution of at least 80.1% of CareFusion's outstanding common stock to Cardinal Health's shareholders (the "Spin-Off"). Proceeds from the offering were deposited in an escrow account established pursuant to an escrow agreement dated July 21, 2009 between CareFusion and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as escrow agent, to be released in connection with the Spin-Off. If the Spin-Off is not consummated prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on November 1, 2009, or if Cardinal Health publicly announces that it has determined to abandon the Spin-Off prior to November 1, 2009, CareFusion will be required to redeem the Notes for a mandatory redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
 
In connection with the sale of the Notes, CareFusion entered into a registration rights agreement, dated July 21, 2009, with the Initial Purchasers. Under the registration rights agreement, CareFusion agreed to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to file and cause to become effective a registration statement with respect to an exchange of the Notes no later than the 366th day after the issue date of the Notes. CareFusion also agreed to file, if obligated, a shelf registration statement relating to the resale of the Notes if the exchange offer is not consummated within the required time period.
This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful.
From time to time, the financial institutions party to these agreements or their affiliates have performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial banking, investment banking and other financial advisory services for Cardinal Health and its affiliates for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses. In particular, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and UBS Loan Finance LLC or their affiliates serve as lenders under Cardinal Health's revolving credit facility. Goldman Sachs Bank USA or its affiliate serves as a dealer under Cardinal Health's commercial paper program. In addition, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and UBS Loan Finance LLC serve as lenders under CareFusion's revolving credit facilities and bridge facility.
The foregoing descriptions of the purchase agreement, indenture and registration rights agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of the agreements filed as exhibits to this Form 8-K.
In addition, on July 22, 2009, Cardinal Health entered into a Separation Agreement with CareFusion that sets forth, among other things, the agreements between Cardinal Health and CareFusion regarding the principal transactions necessary to effect the Spin-Off. It also sets forth other agreements that govern certain aspects of Cardinal Health's ongoing relationship with CareFusion after the completion of the Spin-Off. A summary of certain important features of the Separation Agreement can be found in CareFusion's information statement, which was attached as Exhibit 99.1 to CareFusion's Amendment No. 6 to its Registration Statement on Form 10 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 22, 2009, under the section entitled "Our Relationship With Cardinal Health Following The DistributionThe Separation Agreement", which is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01. The description of the Separation Agreement set forth under this Item 1.01 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of the Separation Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1.
 
On July 14, 2009, CareFusion sold $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 2012 Notes, $450 million aggregate principal amount of 2014 Notes and $700 million aggregate principal amount of its 2019 Notes in a private placement in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers then sold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S of the Securities Act. CareFusion relied on these exemptions based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchasers in the Purchase Agreement.
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of CareFusion and rank equally with all of CareFusion's existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior to all of the CareFusion's existing and future subordinated debt. The Notes are effectively subordinated to the liabilities of CareFusion's subsidiaries, including trade payables and the guarantees by certain of its subsidiaries of CareFusion's revolving credit facilities. The Notes also effectively rank junior in right of payment to any existing and future secured debt of CareFusion to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt.
 
The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful.
The information provided in Item 1.01 is incorporated herein by reference.

The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.

(b) all conditions precedent in respect of the execution and delivery by the Issuer of the Securities have been complied with.
If all the Securities of any series are not to be issued at one time, it shall not be necessary to deliver an Opinion of Counsel and an Officers' Certificate at the time of issuance of each Security, but such Opinion of Counsel and Officers' Certificate, with appropriate modifications, shall be delivered at or before the time of issuance of the first Security of such series.
The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any Securities under this Section if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not lawfully be taken by the Issuer or if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors or board of trustees, executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or trustees or Responsible Officers shall determine that such action would expose the Trustee to personal liability to existing Holders.
If the Issuer shall establish pursuant to Section 2.3 that the Securities of a series or a portion thereof are to be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities, then the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver one or more Global Securities that (i) shall represent and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all of the Securities of such series issued in such form and not yet cancelled, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Global Security or Securities or the nominee of such Depositary, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to such Depositary or its custodian or pursuant to such Depositary's instructions and (iv) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive registered form, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
Section 2.5 . The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Issuer by either (a) the chairman of its Board of Directors or any vice chairman of its Board of Directors or, its Chief Executive Officer, president or any vice president or (b) by its Chief Financial Officer, treasurer or any assistant treasurer or its secretary or any assistant secretary. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be the manual or facsimile signatures of the present or any future such officers and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Securities. Typographical and other minor errors or defects in any such reproduction of any such signature shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any Security that has been duly authenticated and delivered by the Trustee.
Execution of Securities
In case any officer of the Issuer who shall have executed any of the Securities shall cease to be such officer before the Security so executed shall be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or disposed of by the Issuer, such Security nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the person who executed such Security had not ceased to be such officer of the Issuer; and any Security may be executed on behalf of the Issuer by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such Security, shall be the proper officers of the Issuer, although at the date of the execution and delivery of this Indenture any such person was not such an officer.
 
Section 2.6 . Only such Securities as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form hereinbefore recited, executed by the Trustee by the manual signature of one of its authorized signatories, shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose. Such certificate by the Trustee upon any Security executed by the Issuer shall be conclusive evidence that the Security so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Certificate of Authentication
Section 2.7 . The Securities of each series shall be issuable in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.3. With respect to Securities of any series denominated in Dollars, in the absence of any such provisions with respect to the Securities of such series, the Securities of such series in registered form shall be issued without coupons and shall be issuable in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Securities shall be numbered, lettered, or otherwise distinguished in such manner or in accordance with such plan as the officers of the Issuer executing the same may determine with the approval of the Trustee as evidenced by the execution and authentication thereof.
Denomination and Date of Securities; Payments of Interest
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication, shall bear interest, if any, from the date and shall be payable on the dates, in each case, which shall be specified as contemplated by Section 2.3.
The person in whose name any Security of any series is registered at the close of business on any record date applicable to a particular series with respect to any interest payment date for such series shall be entitled to receive the interest, if any, payable on such interest payment date notwithstanding any transfer or exchange of such Security subsequent to the record date and prior to such interest payment date, except if and to the extent the Issuer shall default in the payment of the interest due on such interest payment date for such series, in which case such defaulted interest shall be paid to the persons in whose names Outstanding Securities for such series are registered at the close of business on a subsequent record date (which shall be not less than five Business Days prior to the date of payment of such defaulted interest) established by notice given by mail by or on behalf of the Issuer to the holders of Securities not less than 15 days preceding such subsequent record date. The term "record date" as used with respect to any interest payment date (except a date for payment of defaulted interest) shall mean the date specified as such in the terms of the Securities of any particular series, or, if no such date is so specified, if such interest payment date is the first day of a calendar month, the fifteenth day of the next preceding calendar month or, if such interest payment date is the fifteenth day of a calendar month, the first day of such calendar month, whether or not such record date is a Business Day.
Section 2.8 . The Issuer will keep or cause to be kept at each office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2 a register or registers (a "") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it will register, and will register the transfer of, Securities as in this Article provided. Such register shall be in written form in the English language or in any other form capable of being converted into such form within a reasonable time. The Trustee is hereby initially appointed as the "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering the Securities and transfers thereof as herein provided. In the event that the Trustee shall cease to be Security Registrar, it shall have the right to examine the Security Register at all reasonable times.
Registration, Transfer and Exchange
Security Register
 
Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at any such office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Security or Securities of the same series in authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount.
Any Security or Securities of any series may be exchanged for a Security or Securities of the same series in other authorized denominations, in an equal aggregate principal amount. Securities of any series to be exchanged shall be surrendered at any office or agency to be maintained by the Issuer for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2, and the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor the Security or Securities of the same series which the Securityholder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive, bearing numbers not contemporaneously outstanding.
All Securities presented for registration of transfer, exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so required by the Issuer or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
The Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities. No service charge shall be made for any such transaction.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.8, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive registered form, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
If at any time the Depositary for any Global Securities of any series notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Securities or if at any time the Depositary for such Global Securities shall no longer be eligible under applicable law, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Depositary eligible under applicable law with respect to such Global Securities. If a successor Depositary eligible under applicable law for such Global Securities is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days after the Issuer receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of the Issuer's order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series and tenor, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series and tenor, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Securities, in exchange for such Global Securities.
The Issuer may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that any Global Securities of any series shall no longer be maintained in global form. In such event the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of the Issuer's order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series and tenor, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series and tenor in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Securities, in exchange for such Global Securities.
Any time the Securities of any series are not in the form of Global Securities pursuant to the preceding two paragraphs, the Issuer agrees to supply the Trustee with a reasonable supply of certificated Securities without the legend required by Section 2.4 and the Trustee agrees to hold such Securities in safekeeping until authenticated and delivered pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.
 
If established by the Issuer pursuant to Section 2.3 with respect to any Global Security, the Depositary for such Global Security may surrender such Global Security in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of the same series and tenor in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Issuer and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge, (i) to the Person specified by such Depositary new Securities of the same series and tenor, of any authorized denominations as requested by such Person, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Global Security; and (ii) to such Depositary a new Global Security in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities authenticated and delivered pursuant to clause (i) above.
Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee or an agent of the Issuer or the Trustee. The Trustee or such agent shall deliver such Securities to or as directed by the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
The Issuer shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for a period of 15 days next preceding the first mailing of notice of redemption of Securities of such series to be redeemed, or (b) any Securities selected, called or being called for redemption except, in the case of any Security where public notice has been given that such Security is to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
Section 2.9 . In case any temporary or definitive Security shall become mutilated, defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer in its discretion may execute, and upon the written request of any officer of the Issuer, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Security of the same series, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated or defaced Security, or in lieu of and substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substitute Security shall furnish to the Issuer and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
Upon the issuance of any substitute Security, the Issuer may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Security which has matured or is about to mature or has been called for redemption in full shall become mutilated or defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer may instead of issuing a substitute Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security), if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Issuer and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Issuer and the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
 
Every substitute Security of any series issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any such Security is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of such series duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced or destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
Section 2.10 . All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, or for credit against any payment in respect of a sinking or analogous fund, if surrendered to the Issuer or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee, shall be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be cancelled by it; and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall dispose of cancelled Securities in accordance with its customary procedures. If the Issuer shall acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Cancellation of Securities; Destruction Thereof
Section 2.11 . Pending the preparation of definitive Securities for any series, the Issuer may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities for such series (printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced, in each case in form satisfactory to the Trustee). Temporary Securities of any series shall be issuable as registered Securities without coupons, of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities of such series but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Issuer with the concurrence of the Trustee. Temporary Securities may contain such reference to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Security shall be executed by the Issuer and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities. Without unreasonable delay the Issuer shall execute and shall furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge at each office or agency to be maintained by the Issuer for that purpose pursuant to Section 3.2, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities of such series a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series.

The Issuer in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.

The Issuer will give to the Trustee written notice of the location of any such office or agency and of any change of location thereof. Unless otherwise specified in accordance with Section 2.3, the Issuer hereby initially designates the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, as the office to be maintained by it for each such purpose. In case the Issuer shall fail to so designate or maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to give such notice of the location or of any change in the location thereof, presentations and demands may be made and notices may be served at the Corporate Trust Office.
Offices for Payments, etc

Section 3.4 . Whenever the Issuer shall appoint a paying agent other than the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series, it will cause such paying agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section,
Paying Agents
(a) that it will hold all sums received by it as such agent for the payment of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such series (whether such sums have been paid to it by the Issuer or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Securities of such series or of the Trustee;
(b) that it will give the Trustee notice of any failure by the Issuer (or by any other obligor on the Securities of such series) to make any payment of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such series when the same shall be due and payable; and
(c) pay any such sums so held in trust by it to the Trustee upon the Trustee's written request at any time during the continuance of the failure referred to in clause (b) above.
 
The Issuer will, on or prior to each due date of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such series, deposit with the paying agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal or interest so becoming due, and (unless such paying agent is the Trustee) the Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action.
If the Issuer shall act as its own paying agent with respect to the Securities of any Series, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such series, set aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Securities of such series a sum sufficient to pay such principal or interest so becoming due. The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action.
Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, the Issuer may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining a satisfaction and discharge with respect to one or more or all series of Securities hereunder, or for any other reason, pay or cause to be paid to the Trustee all sums held in trust for any such series by the Issuer or any paying agent hereunder, as required by this Section, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the trusts herein contained.
Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, the agreement to hold sums in trust as provided in this Section is subject to the provisions of Section 9.3 and 9.4.

The rights of Holders to communicate with other Holders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Securities, and the corresponding rights and privileges of the Trustee, shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act. Every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Issuer and the Trustee that neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of any disclosure of information as to names and addresses of Holders made pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act.

To the extent such filings are made with the Commission or the reports are posted on the Issuer's website, the reports will be deemed to be furnished to the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities.
Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Issuer's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).
Section 3.8 . Any Trustee's report required under Section 313(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 shall be transmitted on or before July 15 in each year following the date hereof, so long as any Securities are outstanding hereunder, and shall be dated as of the immediately preceding May 15.

In case an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a series has occurred (which has not been cured or waived) the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.

(2) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any statements, certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such statements, certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein);

Section 5.4 . The Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee or such agent and may otherwise deal with the Issuer and receive, collect, hold and retain collections from the Issuer with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee or such agent.

Right of Trustee to Rely on Officers' Certificate, etc
Section 5.8 . The Trustee for each series of Securities hereunder shall at all times be a corporation having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, and which is eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of a Federal, State or District of Columbia supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.
Persons Eligible for Appointment as Trustee
Section 5.9 . (a) The Trustee, or any trustee or trustees hereafter appointed, may at any time resign with respect to one or more or all series of Securities by giving written notice of resignation to the Issuer and by mailing notice thereof by first class mail to Holders of the applicable series of Securities at their last addresses as they shall appear on the Security Register. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor trustee or trustees with respect to the applicable series by written instrument in duplicate, executed by authority of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee or trustees. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed with respect to any series and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation, the resigning trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee, or for other appropriate relief, in each case at the expense of the Issuer or any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of the applicable series for at least six months may, subject to the provisions of Section 4.12, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.
Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor Trustee
 
(b) In case at any time any of the following shall occur:
(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 with respect to any series of Securities after written request therefor by the Issuer or by any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months; or
(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Issuer or by any Securityholder; or
(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting with respect to any series of Securities, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver or liquidator of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation; then, in any such case, the Issuer may remove the Trustee with respect to the applicable series of Securities and appoint a successor trustee for such series by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to Section 315(e) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months may on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor trustee with respect to such series. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee.
(c) The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee with respect to Securities of such series and appoint a successor trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by delivering to the Trustee so removed, to the successor trustee so appointed and to the Issuer the evidence provided for in Section 6.1 of the action in that regard taken by the Securityholders or for other appropriate relief, in each case at the expense of the Issuer.
(d) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee with respect to any series and any appointment of a successor trustee with respect to such series pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 5.9 shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 5.10.
Section 5.10 . Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 5.9 shall execute and deliver to the Issuer and to its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor trustee with respect to all or any applicable series shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and obligations with respect to such series of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as trustee for such series hereunder; but, nevertheless, on the written request of the Issuer or of the successor trustee, upon payment of its charges then unpaid, the trustee ceasing to act shall, subject to Section 9.4, pay over to the successor trustee all moneys at the time held by it hereunder and shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations. Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Issuer shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers. Any trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a prior claim upon all property or funds held or collected by such trustee to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.6.
Acceptance of Appointment by Successor Trustee
 
If a successor trustee is appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Issuer, the predecessor Trustee and each successor trustee with respect to the Securities of any applicable series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto which shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the predecessor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series as to which the predecessor Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the predecessor Trustee, and shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts under separate indentures.
Upon acceptance of appointment by any successor trustee as provided in this Section 5.10, the Issuer shall mail notice thereof by first-class mail to the Holders of Securities of any series for which such successor trustee is acting as trustee at their last addresses as they shall appear in the Security Register. If the acceptance of appointment is substantially contemporaneous with the resignation, then the notice called for by the preceding sentence may be combined with the notice called for by Section 5.9. If the Issuer fails to mail such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Issuer.
Section 5.11 . Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, that such corporation shall be eligible under the provisions of Section 5.8, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business of Trustee
provided
In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Securities of any series shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee and deliver such Securities so authenticated; and, in case at that time any of the Securities of any series shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor Trustee; and in all such cases such certificate shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities of such series or in this Indenture that the certificate of the Trustee shall have; that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee or to authenticate Securities of any series in the name of any predecessor Trustee shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.
provided
provided
Section 5.12 . At any time when any of the Securities remain Outstanding, the Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents which may be an Affiliate or Affiliates of the Issuer with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series and the Trustee shall give written notice (to be prepared by the Issuer) of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, in the manner provided for in Section 10.4. Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Any such appointment shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing signed by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, and a copy of such
Appointment of Authenticating Agent
 
instrument shall be promptly furnished to the Issuer. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Issuer and shall at all times be a bank or trust company or corporation organized and doing business and in good standing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
Any Person into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such Person shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
An Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee for such series and to the Issuer. The Trustee for any series of Securities may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Issuer. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee for such series may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Issuer and shall promptly give written notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve, in the manner provided for in Section 10.4. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
The Issuer agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.
 
If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternate certificate of authentication in the following form:
Dated:
                        
This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
Section 6.1 . Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by a specified percentage in principal amount of the Securityholders of any or all series may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such specified percentage of Securityholders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee. Proof of execution of any instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.2) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this Article.
Evidence of Action Taken by Securityholders
Section 6.2 . Subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.2, the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder or his agent or proxy may be proved in accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Trustee or in such manner as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee. The holding of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register or by a certificate of the Security Registrar. The Issuer may set a record date for purposes of determining the identity of holders of Securities of any series entitled to vote or consent to any action referred to in Section 6.1, which record date may be set at any time or from time to time by notice to the Trustee, for any date or dates (in the case of any adjournment or reconsideration) not more than 60 days nor less than five days prior to the proposed date of such vote or consent, and thereafter, notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, only holders of Securities of such series of record on such record date shall be entitled to so vote or give such consent or revoke such vote or consent.
Proof of Execution of Instruments and of Holding of Securities; Record Date
Section 6.3 . The Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may deem and treat the person in whose name any Security shall be registered upon the Security Register for such series as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of and, subject to the provisions of this Indenture, interest on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to any such person, or upon his order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys payable upon any such Security.
Holders to be Treated as Owners
 
No Holder of any beneficial interest in any Global Security held on its behalf by a Depositary shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to such Global Security, and such Depositary may be treated by the Issuer, the Trustee, and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee as the owner of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, any paying agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Section 6.4 . In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any or all series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, Securities which are owned by the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver only Securities which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Securities or any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities. In case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of counsel shall be full protection in respect of any decision made by the Trustee in accordance with such advice. Upon request of the Trustee, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officers' Certificate listing and identifying all Securities, if any, known by the Issuer to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above-described persons; and, subject to Sections 5.1 and 5.2, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officers' Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.
Securities Owned by Issuer Deemed Not Outstanding
Section 6.5 . At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 6.1, of the taking of any action by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any Holder of a Security the serial number of which is shown by the evidence to be included among the serial numbers of the Securities the Holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice at the Corporate Trust Office and upon proof of holding as provided in this Article, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the Holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such Security and of any Securities issued in exchange or substitution therefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security. Any action taken by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders of all the Securities affected by such action.

A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture, which shall have been included expressly and solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.
Promptly after the execution by the Issuer and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Issuer shall mail a notice thereof by first class mail to the Holders of Securities of each series affected thereby at their addresses as they shall appear on the Security Register, setting forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture. Any failure of the Issuer to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
 
Section 7.3 . Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions hereof, this Indenture shall be and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Holders of Securities of each series affected thereby shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments, and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.
Effect of Supplemental Indenture
Section 7.4 . As a condition to executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trust created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall receive, and (subject to Section 315 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939) shall be fully protected in conclusively relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture and an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to the execution of such supplemental indenture have been fulfilled. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
Execution of Supplemental Indenture
Section 7.5 . Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article may bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee for such series as to any matter provided for by such supplemental indenture or as to any action taken at any such meeting. If the Issuer or the Trustee shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Board of Directors, to any modification of this Indenture contained in any such supplemental indenture may be prepared by the Issuer, authenticated by the Trustee and delivered in exchange for the Securities of such series then outstanding.
Notation on Securities in Respect of Supplemental Indentures
Section 7.6 . Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 as then in effect.

Issuer May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms
 
Section 8.2 . In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance, and following such an assumption by the successor corporation, such successor corporation shall succeed to and be substituted for the Issuer, with the same effect as if it had been named herein. Such successor corporation may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the Issuer prior to such succession any or all of the Securities issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee; and, upon the order of such successor corporation instead of the Issuer and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Indenture prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver any Securities which previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the Issuer to the Trustee for authentication, and any Securities which such successor corporation thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the Trustee for that purpose. All of the Securities so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Securities theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Securities had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
Successor Corporation Substituted
In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the Securities thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate.

Section 8.3 . The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 5.1 and 5.2, shall receive an Opinion of Counsel, prepared in accordance with Section 10.5, as conclusive evidence that any such consolidation, merger, sale, lease or conveyance, and any such assumption, and any such liquidation or dissolution, complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture.

Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture
 
Government Obligations, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a reputable firm of certified public accountants without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Securities of such series not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal amount and interest accrued to the date of maturity or redemption; (2) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of the deposit or will occur as a result of the deposit and the deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other instrument to which the Issuer is a party or by which the Issuer is bound; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture and the Securities of such series and (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Securities of such series at maturity or at the redemption date, as the case may be. The Trustee, on demand of the Issuer accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel and at the cost and expense of the Issuer, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging such satisfaction of and discharging this Indenture with respect to such series; that the rights of Holders of the Securities to receive amounts in respect of principal of and interest on the Securities held by them shall not be delayed longer than required by then-applicable mandatory rules or policies of any securities exchange upon which the Securities are listed.

In connection with the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture with respect to Securities of any series, all moneys then held by any paying agent under the provisions of this Indenture with respect to such series of Securities shall, upon demand of the Issuer, be repaid to it or paid to the Trustee and thereupon such paying agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such moneys.
Repayment of Moneys Held by Paying Agent
Section 9.4 . Any moneys deposited with or paid to the Trustee or any paying agent for the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security of any series and not applied but remaining unclaimed for two years after the date upon which such principal or interest shall have become due and payable, shall, upon the written request of the Issuer and unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of applicable escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property law, be repaid to the Issuer by the Trustee for such series or such paying agent, and the Holder of the Security of such series shall, unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of applicable escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property laws, thereafter look only to the Issuer for any payment which such Holder may be entitled to collect, and all liability of the Trustee or any paying agent with respect to such moneys shall thereupon cease.
Return of Moneys Held by Trustee and Paying Agent Unclaimed for Two Years
 
Section 10.1 . No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture, or in any Security, or because of any indebtedness evidenced thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, as such or against any past, present or future stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the Issuer or of any successor, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance of the Securities by the holders thereof and as part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.
Incorporators, Stockholders, Officers and Directors of Issuer Exempt from Individual Liability
Section 10.2 . Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, expressed or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any person, firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and their successors and the Holders of the Securities, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture or under any covenant or provision herein contained, all such covenants and provisions being for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and of the Holders of the Securities.

Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder entitled thereto, at his last address as it appears in the Security Register. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
In case, by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service, it shall be impracticable to mail notice to the Issuer and Securityholders when such notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice.
 
Section 10.5 . Upon any application or demand by the Issuer to the Trustee to take any action under any of the provisions of this Indenture, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with and an Opinion of Counsel stating that in the opinion of such counsel all such conditions precedent have been complied with, except that in the case of any such application or demand as to which the furnishing of such documents is specifically required by any provision of this Indenture relating to such particular application or demand, no additional certificate or opinion need be furnished.

Any certificate, statement or opinion of an officer of the Issuer may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by counsel, unless such officer knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous. Any certificate, statement or opinion of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, information with respect to which is in the possession of the Issuer, upon the certificate, statement or opinion of or representations by an officer of officers of the Issuer, unless such counsel knows that the certificate, statement or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous.
Any certificate, statement or opinion of an officer of the Issuer or of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to accounting matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by an accountant or firm of accountants in the employ of the Issuer, unless such officer or counsel, as the case may be, knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the accounting matters upon which his certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous.
Any certificate or opinion of any independent firm of public accountants filed with the Trustee shall contain a statement that such firm is independent.

Section 11.1 . The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to the Securities of any series which are redeemable before their maturity or to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3 for Securities of such series.
Applicability of Article
Section 11.2 . Notice of redemption to the Holders of Securities of any series to be redeemed as a whole or in part at the option of the Issuer shall be prepared by the Issuer and given by mailing notice of such redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to such Holders of Securities of such series at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the registry books. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Failure to give notice by mail, or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such series.
Notice of Redemption; Partial Redemptions
 
The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall identify the Securities (including CUSIP numbers) to be redeemed, specify the principal amount of each Security of such series held by such Holder to be redeemed, the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price, the place or places of payment, the name and address of the Paying Agent, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities, that such redemption is pursuant to the mandatory or optional sinking fund, or both, if such be the case, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice, that on and after said date interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue and any other provisions related to the particular series of Securities. In case any Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
The notice of redemption of Securities of any series to be redeemed at the option of the Issuer shall be given by the Issuer or, at the Issuer's written request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuer, provided that the Issuer shall have given the Trustee notice of such redemption at least 45 days before the redemption date.
On or prior to the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section, the Issuer will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents (or, if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 3.4) an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities of such series so called for redemption at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption.
If less than all of the outstanding Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Issuer shall at least 45 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) notify the Trustee of the date fixed for redemption and the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be redeemed. If less than all of the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, Securities of such Series to be redeemed in whole or in part. Securities may be redeemed in part in multiples equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such series or any multiple thereof. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Securities of such series selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities of such series selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities of any series shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
Section 11.3 . If notice of redemption has been given as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Issuer shall default in the payment of such Securities at the redemption price, together with interest accrued to said date) interest on the Securities or portions of Securities so called for redemption shall cease to accrue and, except as provided in Sections 5.5 and 9.4, such Securities shall cease from and after the date fixed for redemption to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Indenture, and the Holders thereof shall have no right in respect of such Securities except the right to receive the redemption price thereof and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. On presentation and surrender of such
Payment of Securities Called for Redemption
 
Securities at a place of payment specified in said notice, said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Issuer at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; that any semiannual payment of interest becoming due on the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities registered as such on the relevant record date subject to the terms and provisions of Section 2.4 hereof.
provided
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of an Original Issue Discount Security) borne by the Security.
Upon presentation of any definitive Security to be redeemed in part only, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Issuer, a new definitive Security or Securities of such series, of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.
Section 11.4 . The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". The date on which a sinking fund payment is to be made is herein referred to as the "sinking fund payment date".
Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds
In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any series of Securities in cash, the Issuer may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of such series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except upon redemption pursuant to the mandatory sinking fund) by the Issuer or receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except as aforesaid) by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10, (b) receive credit for optional sinking fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section, or (c) receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) redeemed by the Issuer through any optional redemption provision contained in the terms of such series. Securities so delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustee at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Securities.
On or before the sixtieth day next preceding each sinking fund payment date for any series, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee a written statement (which need not contain the statements required by Section 10.5) signed by an authorized officer of the Issuer (a) specifying the portion of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion to be satisfied by credit of Securities of such series, (b) stating that none of the Securities of such series has theretofore been so credited, (c) stating that no defaults in the payment of interest or Events of Default with respect to such series have occurred (which have not been waived or cured) and are continuing and (d) stating whether or not the Issuer intends to exercise its right to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series and, if so, specifying the amount of such optional sinking fund payment which the Issuer intends to pay on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Any Securities of such series to be credited and required to be delivered to the Trustee in order for the Issuer to be entitled to credit therefor as aforesaid which have not theretofore been delivered to the Trustee shall be delivered for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10 to the Trustee with such written statement (or reasonably promptly thereafter if acceptable to the Trustee). Such written statement shall be irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustee the Issuer shall become unconditionally obligated to make all the cash payments or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Issuer, on or before any such sixtieth day, to deliver such written statement and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable
 
election of the Issuer (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Issuer will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section.
If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $50,000 (or a lesser sum if the Issuer shall so request) with respect to the Securities of any particular series, such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $50,000 or less and the Issuer makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $50,000 is available. The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 11.2, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date a sufficient principal amount of Securities of such series to absorb said cash, as nearly as may be, and shall (if requested in writing by the Issuer) inform the Issuer of the serial numbers of the Securities of such series (or portions thereof) so selected. Securities of any series which are (a) owned by the Issuer or an entity known by the Trustee to be directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer, as shown by the Security Register, and not known to the Trustee to have been pledged or hypothecated by the Issuer or any such entity or (b) identified in an Officers' Certificate at least 60 days prior to the sinking fund payment date as being beneficially owned by, and not pledged or hypothecated by, the Issuer or an entity directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer shall be excluded from Securities of such series eligible for selection for redemption. The Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Issuer (or the Issuer, if it shall so request the Trustee in writing) shall cause notice of redemption of the Securities of such series to be given in substantially the manner provided in Section 11.2 (and with the effect provided in Section 11.3) for the redemption of Securities of such series in part at the option of the Issuer. The amount of any sinking fund payments not so applied or allocated to the redemption of Securities of such series shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment for such series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Any and all sinking fund moneys held on the stated maturity date of the Securities of any particular series (or earlier, if such maturity is accelerated), which are not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series shall be applied, together with other moneys, if necessary, sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, the Securities of such series at maturity.
At least one Business Day before each sinking fund payment date, the Issuer shall pay to the Trustee in cash or shall otherwise provide for the payment of all interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption on Securities to be redeemed on the next following sinking fund payment date.
The Trustee shall not redeem or cause to be redeemed any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of Securities for such series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a Default in payment of interest on such Securities or of any Event of Default except that, where the mailing of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, that it shall have received from the Issuer a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such Default or Event of Default shall occur, and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking fund, shall, during the continuance of such Default or Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article Four and held for the payment of all such Securities. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 4.9 or the Default cured on or before the sixtieth day preceding the sinking fund payment date in any year, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this Section to the redemption of such Securities.
provided
 
Section 12.1 . Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3 for Securities of any series, the provisions of this Article Twelve shall apply to each series of Securities, and the Issuer may, at its option, effect defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under Section 12.2, or covenant defeasance of or within a series under Section 12.3 in accordance with the terms of such Securities and in accordance with this Article.
Issuer's Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance

For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to such Outstanding Securities, the Issuer may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 4.1(c) or Section 4.1(h) or otherwise, as the case may be, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.

(f) In the case of an election under Section 12.3, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders of such Outstanding Securities will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit and such covenant defeasance had not occurred.

Deposited Money and Government Obligations to Be Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions
The Issuer shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 12.4 or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of such Outstanding Securities. The foregoing sentence shall survive the termination of this Indenture and the earlier resignation or removal of the Trustee.
Anything in this Article Twelve to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Issuer from time to time upon Company Order any money or Government Obligations (or other property and any proceeds therefrom) held by it as provided in Section 12.4 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent defeasance or covenant defeasance, as applicable, in accordance with this Article.
Section 12.6 . If the Trustee or any paying agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with Section 12.5 with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the Issuer's obligations under this Indenture and such Securities shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 12.2 or 12.3, as the case may be, until such time as the Trustee or paying agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 12.5; provided, however, that if the Issuer makes any payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any such Security or following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or paying agent.

Notice to holders of Notes to be redeemed will be delivered by first-class mail at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. Unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.

(b) (i) If prior to the completion of the placement of the Securities by the Initial Purchasers with the Subsequent Purchasers if occurring after the Closing Date, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Offering Memorandum as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend or supplement the Final Offering Memorandum, the Company will promptly notify the Initial Purchasers thereof and promptly prepare an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission, and (ii) if at any time prior to the Closing Date, any event occurs as a result of which the Time of Sale Information as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company will promptly notify the Initial Purchasers thereof and promptly prepare and furnish to the Initial Purchasers and to such dealers as the Representatives may designate, such amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Information which will correct such statement or omission or which will effect such compliance.
(c) The Company will advise the Representatives promptly, and confirm such advice in writing, of the issuance by any governmental or regulatory authority of any order preventing or suspending the use of any of the Time of Sale Information or the Final Offering Memorandum or any other written materials or, to the Company's knowledge, the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose.
(d) The Company shall cooperate with the Initial Purchasers and counsel for the Initial Purchasers to qualify or register (or to obtain exemptions from qualifying or registering) all or any part of the Securities for offer and sale under the securities laws of the several states of the United States, the provinces of Canada or any other jurisdictions reasonably designated by the Initial Purchasers, shall comply with such laws and shall continue such qualifications, registrations and exemptions in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities. The Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to take any action that would subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not presently qualified or where it would be subject to taxation as a foreign corporation. The Company will advise the Initial Purchasers promptly of the suspension of the qualification or registration of (or any such exemption relating to) the Securities for offering, sale or trading in any jurisdiction or any initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, and in the event of the issuance of any order suspending such qualification, registration or exemption, the Company shall use its best efforts to obtain the withdrawal thereof at the earliest possible moment.

(g) The Company will not, and will cause its affiliates not to, make any offer or sale of securities of the Company of any class if, as a result of the doctrine of "integration" referred to in Rule 502, such offer or sale would render invalid (for the purpose of (i) the sale of the Securities by the Company to the Initial Purchasers, (ii) the resale of the Securities by the Initial Purchasers to Subsequent Purchasers or (iii) the resale of the Securities by such Subsequent Purchasers to others) the exemption from the registration requirements of the Act provided by Section 4(2) thereof or by Rule 144A or by Regulation S thereunder or otherwise.
(h) Until the expiration of one year after the Closing Date, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its affiliates (as defined in Rule 144 under the Act ("")) to, resell any of the Securities which constitute "restricted securities" under Rule 144 that have been reacquired by any of them.
Rule 144
(i) While the Securities remain outstanding and are "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the Act, the Company will, during any period in which the Company is not subject to and in compliance with Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, furnish to holders of the Securities and prospective purchasers of the Securities designated by such holders, upon the request of such holders or such prospective purchasers, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Act.
(j) The Company will assist the Initial Purchasers in arranging for the Securities to be eligible for clearance and settlement through the Depositary Trust Company.

(f) Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given in the Time of Sale Information (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and the Final Offering Memorandum (exclusive of any supplement thereto) and prior to the Closing Date, there shall not have been any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the financial condition, business, management, properties or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, the effect of which is, in the judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical to proceed with the offering or the delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Time of Sale Information and the Final Offering Memorandum.
(g) Subsequent to the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, there shall not have been any downgrading in the ratings of any of the Company's debt securities, by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as such term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act or any public announcement by any such organization that it has under surveillance or review with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities (or proposed rating of the Securities).

Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company by telephone or in the manner described in Section 14 hereof.
6. . (a) The Company covenants and agrees with the Representatives that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Exchange Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation and printing of the Time of Sale Information and the Final Offering Memorandum and amendments
Expenses
 
and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivery of copies thereof to the Initial Purchasers and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing this Agreement, the Indenture, the Registration Rights Agreement, the DTC Agreement, any blue sky and legal investment memoranda and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Representatives in connection with such qualification and in connection with any blue sky and legal investment surveys; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities or the Exchange Securities; (v) the cost of preparing the Securities or the Exchange Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture, the Securities and the Exchange Securities; (vii) all fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) of the Company in connection with approval of the Securities by the Depositary for "book-entry" transfer, and the performance by the Company of its other obligations under this Agreement; (viii) the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent and any paying agent and the related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties; and (ix) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section.

7. . If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Initial Purchasers set forth in Section 5 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 11 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Initial Purchasers, the Company will reimburse the Initial Purchasers severally upon demand for all reasonable and detailed out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
Reimbursement of Initial Purchasers' Expenses
8. . Each of the Initial Purchasers (with respect to Sections 8(a), (b) and (c) below), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, hereby agree to observe the following procedures in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities:
Offer, Sale and Resale Procedures
(a) Offers and sales of the Securities will be made only by the Initial Purchasers or Affiliates thereof qualified to do so in the jurisdictions in which such offers or sales are made. Each such offer or sale shall only be made to persons whom the offeror or seller reasonably believes to be QIBs or non-U.S. persons outside the United States to whom the offeror or seller reasonably believes offers and sales of the Securities may be made in reliance upon Regulation S upon the terms and conditions set forth in Annex B hereto, which Annex B is hereby expressly made a part hereof.
(b) The Securities will be offered by approaching prospective Subsequent Purchasers on an individual basis. No general solicitation or general advertising (within the meaning of Rule 502) will be used in the United States in connection with the offering of the Securities.
 
(c) In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a ""), each Initial Purchaser severally represents, warrants and agrees that, with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State (the ""), it has not made and will not make an offer of the Securities to the public in that Relevant Member State except that it may, with effect from and including the Relevant Implementation Date, make an offer of the Securities to the public in that Relevant Member State:
Relevant Member State
Relevant Implementation Date
(i) in the period beginning on the date of publication of a prospectus in relation to those Securities which has been approved by the competent authority in that Relevant Member State or, where appropriate, approved in another Relevant Member State and notified to the competent authority in that Relevant Member State, all in accordance with the Prospectus Directive and ending on the date which is 12 months after the date of such publication;
(ii) at any time to legal entities which are authorized or regulated to operate in the financial markets or, if not so authorized or regulated, whose corporate purpose is solely to invest in securities;
(iii) at any time to any legal entity which has two or more of (1) an average of at least 250 employees during the last financial year; (2) a total balance sheet of more than 43,000,000 and (3) an annual net turnover of more than 50,000,000, as shown in its last annual or consolidated accounts; or
(iv) at any time in any other circumstances which do not require the publication by the Company of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.
For the purposes of this provision, the expression an "offer of Securities to the public" in relation to any Securities in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Securities to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Securities, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State and the expression Prospectus Directive means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.
(d) Each certificate for a Security will bear the applicable legend set forth in the Final Offering Memorandum under the caption "Notice to Investors" for the time period and upon the other terms stated in the Final Offering Memorandum.
 
(e) The Initial Purchasers shall be permitted to convey to purchasers one or more term sheets relating to the Securities containing customary information.
9. .
Indemnification and Contribution
(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser and each person who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Final Offering Memorandum, the Time of Sale Information or any Company Supplemental Disclosure Document, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them as such expenses are incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser through the Representatives specifically for use therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
(b) Each Initial Purchaser severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Initial Purchaser, but only with reference to written information relating to such Initial Purchaser furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Initial Purchaser through the Representatives specifically for use in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Initial Purchaser may otherwise have.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Sections 9(a) or (b) hereof of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof, but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under Sections 9(a) and (b) hereof except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such omission through the forfeiture of substantial claims or defenses. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein, and to the extent that it may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the
 
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 9 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel), approved by the Representatives in the case of paragraph (a) of this Section 9, representing the indemnified parties under such paragraph (a) who are parties to such action), (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the indemnifying party has authorized the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party; and except that, if clause (i) or (iii) is applicable, such liability shall be only in respect of the counsel referred to in such clause (i) or (iii). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent, but if settled with its written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified parties against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or
 
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchasers, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Offering Memorandum. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Initial Purchasers on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount of total underwriting discounts and commissions actually received by it under this Agreement. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchasers' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
10. . If any one or more Initial Purchasers shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Initial Purchasers shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Initial Purchasers) the Securities which the defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase; provided, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Initial Purchasers do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Initial Purchaser or the Company. In the event of a default by any Initial Purchaser as set forth in this Section 10, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding seven days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Final Offering Memorandum or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Initial Purchaser for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
Default by an Initial Purchaser
 
11. . This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if prior to such time (i) trading in any securities of the Company shall have been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange or The Nasdaq National Market shall have been suspended or materially limited, (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities in New York shall have been declared either by Federal or state authorities or a material disruption shall have occurred in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services in the United States or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other international or domestic calamity, crisis or change in political, financial or economic conditions, the effect of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to offer, sell or deliver the Securities.
Termination
12. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Initial Purchasers are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of the Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person affiliated with the Company. Additionally, in connection with the offering of the Securities, neither the Representatives nor any other Initial Purchaser is advising the Company or any other person affiliated with the Company as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Initial Purchasers shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Initial Purchasers of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Initial Purchasers and shall not be on behalf of the Company. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Initial Purchasers, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility
13. . The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Initial Purchasers set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser or the Company or any of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 9 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 6, 7 and 9 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.
Representations and Indemnities to Survive
14. . All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or telexed and confirmed to it, at the addresses specified in Schedule I hereto; or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telexed and confirmed to it at 3750 Torrey View Court, San Diego, California 92130, Attention: General Counsel.
Notices
 
15. . This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 9 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. The term "successors and assigns" shall not include a purchaser, in its capacity as such, of the Securities from any of the Initial Purchasers.
Successors
16. . Except as set forth below, no claim, counterclaim or dispute of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement may be commenced, prosecuted or continued in any court other than the courts of the State of New York located in the City and County of New York or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which courts shall have jurisdiction over the adjudication of such matters, and the Company consents to the jurisdiction of such courts and personal service with respect thereto. The Company hereby consents to personal jurisdiction, service and venue in any court in which any claim arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement is brought by any third party against any Initial Purchaser or any indemnified party. Each Initial Purchaser and the Company (on its behalf and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, on behalf of its stockholders and affiliates) waive all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) in any way arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The Company agrees that a final judgment in any such action, proceeding or counterclaim brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon the Company and may be enforced in any other courts to the jurisdiction of which the Company is or may be subject, by suit upon such judgment.

(f) The Escrow Agent may act through its agent and shall only be responsible for the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any agent.
(g) The Escrow Agent may consult with counsel of its own selection and the advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection from liability in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon.
(h) The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon any order, judgment, certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing delivered to it hereunder without being required to determine the authenticity or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity or the service thereof. The Escrow Agent may act in conclusive reliance upon any instrument or signature believed by it to be genuine and may assume that any person purporting to give receipt or advice to make any statement or execute any document in connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so. All instructions given to the Escrow Agent shall be in writing.
5.2 . The Escrow Agent may resign by giving no less than 30 Business Days' prior written notice to the Company and the Trustee. Such resignation shall take effect upon the later to occur of (i) delivery of all Collateral maintained by the Escrow Agent hereunder and copies of any books, records, plans and other documents in the Escrow Agent's possession relating to such Collateral or this Agreement to a successor agent approved by the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (ii) the Company, the Trustee and such successor agent entering into this Agreement or any written successor agreement no less favorable to the interests of the Holders of the Notes and the Trustee than this Agreement and the taking of such other steps as may be necessary to give the successor agent a first priority perfected security interest in the Proceeds Account and the other Collateral, and the Escrow Agent shall thereupon be discharged of any obligations arising under this Agreement after the effective date of such resignation.

Expenses
 
6.1 . The parties hereto may specifically waive any breach of this Agreement by the other parties, but no such waiver shall be deemed to have been given unless such waiver is in writing, signed by the waiving party, and specifically designates the breach waived, nor shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver of similar or other breaches.
Waiver
6.2 .

7. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Notes, the Indenture, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Agreement and performance of its obligations thereunder will not conflict with, constitute a default under, or violate (i) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws of the Company, (ii) any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the contracts listed on Schedule A, (iii) New York, Delaware corporate or federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion in this paragraph), or (iv) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on the Company of which we are aware.
8. The statements set forth in the Time of Sale Information and the Final Offering Memorandum under the captions "Description of the Notes" and "Exchange Offer; Registration Rights," insofar as they purport to constitute a summary of the terms of the Notes and the Indenture, are accurate in all material respects and under the caption "Description of Credit Facilities" insofar as it purports to describe the provisions of the documents referred to therein are accurate in all material respects.
9. The statements in the Time of Sale Information and the Final Offering Memorandum under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences," insofar as they constitute statements of U.S. federal income tax law or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute, and subject to the limitations set forth therein, fairly summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
10. The Company is not, nor immediately after the sale of the Notes and the application of the proceeds from such sale (as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Final Offering Memorandum under the caption "Use of Proceeds") will be, an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
11. Assuming (i) the representations of the Initial Purchasers and the Company contained in the Purchase Agreement are true, correct and complete, (ii) compliance by the Initial Purchasers and the Company with their respective covenants set forth in the Purchase Agreement, (iii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties made in accordance with the Purchase Agreement and the Offering Memorandum by purchasers to whom the Initial Purchasers initially resell the Notes and (iv) that purchasers to whom the Initial Purchasers initially resell the Notes receive a copy of the Offering Memorandum prior to such sale or a preliminary offering memorandum containing a section captioned "Transfer Restrictions" that is substantially similar to the section captioned "Transfer Restrictions" in the Offering Memorandum, it is not necessary in connection with the offer, sale and delivery of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or the offer and resales of the Notes by the Initial Purchasers, in the manner contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and described in the Offering Memorandum, to register the Notes under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or to qualify the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.
Subject to the foregoing, we confirm to you that, on the basis of the information we gained in the course of performing the services referred to above, no facts have come to our attention which cause us to believe that (i) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the Time of Sale, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (ii) the Offering Memorandum, as of its date or as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Exhibit C
1. The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted as described in the Time of Sale Information and the Final Offering Memorandum.
2. To the best of my knowledge, there are (i) no legal or governmental proceedings pending or threatened that would need to be described in the Time of Sale Information or the Final Offering Memorandum and (ii) no contract or document that would need to be described in the Time of Sale Information or the Final Offering Memorandum, if, for both clauses (i) and (ii) above, the Time of Sale Information or the Final Offering Memorandum were a prospectus included in a registration statement under the Act.
3. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Notes, the Indenture, the Registration Rights Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement and performance of its obligations thereunder will not conflict with, constitute a default under, or violate (i) any of the terms conditions or provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii) the terms of any of the agreements listed on Schedule A hereto, (iii) California, Delaware or federal law or regulation (other than federal and state securities or blue sky laws, as to which I express no opinion in this paragraph), or (iv) any judgment, writ, injunction, decree, order or ruling of any court or governmental authority binding on the Company of which I am aware.
4. The Exchange Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) have been duly authorized by the Company.
5. Except for permits and similar authorizations required under the securities or Blue Sky laws of certain jurisdictions (as to which I express no opinion), no consent, approval, authorization or other order of any regulatory body, administrative agency or other governmental body of the State of Delaware or the State of California is legally required for the valid issuance and sale of the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in the manner contemplated by the Agreement.
6. The statements in the Time of Sale Information and the Final Offering Memorandum under the heading "Business  Legal Proceedings  FDA Consent Decree" (the "Regulatory Statements"), insofar as such Regulatory Statements constitute summaries of documents or legal proceedings or refer to matters of law or legal conclusions, are accurate and complete in all material respects and present fairly the information purported to be shown.
Based upon my participation in the preparation of the Time of Sale Information and the Final Offering Memorandum and upon my review and discussion of the contents thereof, nothing has come to my attention that would lead me to believe that the Time of Sale Information at the Time of Sale (which I assume to be the date of the Agreement) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or that the Final Offering Memorandum, as of its date or the Closing Date, contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
 
were made, not misleading. In making the statements in the immediately proceedings sentence, I am not expressing any opinion on the financial statements or financial exhibits and other financial data included therein or omitted therefrom and I am not responsible for the adequacy or accuracy of the derivation or compilation from the Company's accounting records of the financial data included in the Time of Sale Information or the Final Offering Memorandum.
