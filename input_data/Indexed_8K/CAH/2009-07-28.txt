CareFusion on track for Aug. 31 separation from Cardinal Health; information statement to be mailed to Cardinal Health shareholders shortly
 CareFusion Corporation, the company that is expected to become public following the planned spinoff of Cardinal Health's clinical and medical products businesses, today announced that the Form 10 registration statement for the spinoff has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
SAN DIEGO, July 28, 2009
The effectiveness of the Form 10 was one of the few remaining conditions to the planned spinoff. Earlier this month, Cardinal Health's board of directors approved the spinoff through a pro rata distribution of at least 80.1 percent of the shares of CareFusion common stock to Cardinal Health shareholders, with Cardinal Health retaining the remaining shares. As previously announced, the company completed the necessary financing for the spinoff transaction, and the IRS has issued a private letter ruling regarding the tax-free nature of the transaction. With these conditions satisfied, the company remains on schedule for the separation from Cardinal Health on Aug. 31.
"This represents a major milestone on the road to launching CareFusion as a separate public company on Sept. 1," said David Schlotterbeck, chief executive officer of CareFusion. "We are focused on providing the products and services necessary to improve the safety and quality of health care and look forward to enhancing long-term value to our future shareholders as an independent company."
As previously disclosed, the distribution of shares of CareFusion common stock is scheduled for after the close of trading on Aug. 31 to Cardinal Health's shareholders of record as of 5 p.m. EDT on Aug. 25, the record date for the spinoff. Cardinal Health will distribute 0.5 share of CareFusion common stock for each common share of Cardinal Health outstanding as of the record date. Shareholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of CareFusion common stock, which will be aggregated and sold on their behalf.
There is no current market for CareFusion common stock. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has authorized the listing of CareFusion common stock under the symbol "CFN" following the spin-off. CareFusion has been advised that trading in its common stock is expected to begin on a "when issued" basis shortly before the record date under the symbol "CFN wi." On Aug. 31, "when issued" trading is scheduled to end and "regular way" trading is scheduled to begin for CareFusion common stock on Sept. 1 under the ticker symbol "CFN."
