Cardinal Health today reported fiscal 2009 diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $3.16, or $3.48 on a non-GAAP basis
DUBLIN, Ohio, Aug. 18, 2009

, which was in line with the company's expectations and includes a $0.03 dilutive impact from the classification of the company's UK-based Martindale injectable manufacturing business as discontinued operations.
The company reported fourth-quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.74, or $0.86 on a non-GAAP basis, which includes a $0.01 dilutive impact from the Martindale classification as discontinued operations. The quarter was highlighted by the Healthcare Supply Chain Services (HSCS) segment, which reported an 8 percent increase in segment profit, driven by strong growth in the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain and Nuclear Pharmacy Services businesses, and a return to growth in its surgical and procedural kitting operations. The growth in the final quarter contributed to a slight increase of 0.4 percent in HSCS segment profit for the full fiscal year.
Fourth-quarter and full-year segment profit for the Clinical and Medical Products segment declined on a year-over-year basis within company expectations, due to the deferral in hospital capital spending and the impact from a shipping hold on its Alaris System infusion product during the

second half of fiscal 2009. Sequentially from the third quarter, revenue and segment profit increased. In addition, the Alaris System shipping hold was lifted in July. The spinoff of CareFusion Corp., the company that will become public from the spinoff of Cardinal Health's Clinical and Medical Products businesses, remains on track to be completed after the close of business on Aug. 31.
"Fiscal 2009 saw accelerated investments to improve our ability to serve customers, as well as disciplined cost-containment measures, all of which will continue through an important transition year in fiscal 2010," said R. Kerry Clark, chairman and chief executive officer of Cardinal Health. "With the improvement in the core businesses within the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment and the resumption of customer installations for the Alaris System, both Cardinal Health and CareFusion have solid foundations and initiatives in place to position themselves for long-term success."
CONSOLIDATED Q4 AND FY09 RESULTS
The company reported fourth-quarter revenue growth of 10 percent to $25.2 billion and a 15 percent decline in earnings from continuing operations to $268 million, driven by previously disclosed factors impacting the Clinical and Medical Products business with a partial offset from solid profit growth from the Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment. Special items and impairments and other costs associated with the planned spinoff decreased after-tax earnings by $44 million or $0.12 per share. Excluding these items, fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations
2
declined 9 percent to $311 million.
For full fiscal 2009, consolidated revenue grew 9 percent to $99.5 billion and earnings from continuing operations declined 12 percent to $1.1 billion. The net after-tax dilutive impact from special items and impairments and the impact of other costs associated with the planned spinoff totaled $114 million or $0.32 per share. Excluding these items, non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations declined 8 percent to $1.3 billion. In addition, the company finished the year with strong consolidated operating cash flow of approximately $1.6 billion, through disciplined management of working capital.
Q4 and FY09 SUMMARY

FISCAL 2009 SEGMENT RESULTS AND FISCAL 2010 OUTLOOK
Healthcare Supply Chain Services
The Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment increased fourth-quarter revenue 11 percent to $24.3 billion, driven by strong growth in the pharmaceutical supply chain business across all customer categories. Sales to bulk pharmaceutical customers
4
increased 16 percent to $11 billion and sales to non-bulk pharmaceutical customers
5
increased 9 percent to $11.1 billion. Segment profit for the quarter increased 8 percent to $341 million, driven by the profit contribution from revenue gains, growth in generics, strong performance under the company's fee-for-service arrangements with branded manufacturers, strength in nuclear pharmacy and disciplined expense management.
For the full year, segment revenue increased 10 percent to $95.7 billion, driven by solid sales across the segment. Full-year revenue from bulk pharmaceutical customers increased 17 percent to $43.7 billion and annual sales to non-bulk pharmaceutical customers increased 4 percent to $43.6 billion. Annual segment profit was slightly positive from the previous year at $1.3 billion with profit contribution from revenue gains, solid generics performance and medical supply chain growth being offset by pharmaceutical contract repricings, the impact from anti-diversion activities and bad-debt expense.
The company is in the midst of driving several important initiatives designed to optimize customer mix and improve margins. These include actions to enhance the overall experience across all customer categories, improve its generic pharmaceutical and medical product sourcing programs and enhance internal processes related to pricing. This is complemented by lean operating model initiatives, including a disciplined focus on inventory levels across all lines of business. Importantly, the medical and surgical supply chain businesses have initiated a transformation program, which is designed to implement new systems and processes to improve customer ordering and service.
"The Healthcare Supply Chain Services segment had a strong finish to a solid year," said George Barrett, incoming chairman and chief executive officer of Cardinal Health. "While we are pleased with the improvement in the supply chain segment, our work continues as we take the necessary strategic actions to drive long-term growth."
 
Fiscal 2010 Outlook for New' Cardinal Health
Excluding the businesses that will be spun off as CareFusion, Cardinal Health's adjusted fiscal 2009 revenue was $96 billion and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for the full year was $2.12 or $2.26 on a non-GAAP basis
6
.
"As we look forward to fiscal 2010 for new' Cardinal Health, we expect low single-digit revenue growth and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $1.90 to $2.00, which is a slight increase from the implied range of $1.87 to $1.91 provided at our Investor Day on June 2," Barrett said. "The progress we made in fiscal 2009 reinforces our belief that the company's core businesses are strong and the investments we are making in fiscal 2010 will create a more positive and sustainable longer-term growth trajectory."

The company expects its Medical segment to contribute strong segment profit growth in fiscal 2010, which will be offset by an expected decline in Pharmaceutical segment profit, resulting from business investments, unfavorable year-over-year comparison from generic launches and customer contract repricings.
Additional Fourth-Quarter and Recent Highlights from Cardinal Health:
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical and Medical Products
Fourth-quarter revenue for the Clinical and Medical Products segment declined 12 percent to $1.1 billion, due to the continued deferral in hospital capital spending, the Alaris System shipping hold and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Segment profit declined 32 percent in the fourth quarter to $157 million, driven by the decline in revenue and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. The quarterly profit decline was partially offset by aggressive spending reductions and sales of ChloraPrep from the Enturia acquisition.
Clinical and Medical Products revenue saw a slight decrease of 0.4 percent for the full year to $4.6 billion, with increases in the first half of the year being offset by the revenue decline in the second half. Segment profit was also affected by the second-half factors that impacted segment revenue and finished the year down 9 percent to $670 million. The Enturia acquisition continued to exceed expectations for the quarter and full year.
"There is no doubt that the second half of fiscal 2009 was a challenging economic environment, but we assessed and addressed the market conditions correctly," said David Schlotterbeck, chief executive officer of CareFusion. "In the fourth quarter, we saw a sequential improvement in customer orders from the third quarter and continued strong performance from the infection prevention businesses with top- and bottom-line growth. In addition, resuming customer installations of our Alaris System infusion line in July, following 510 (k) clearance from the Food and Drug Administration, was an important milestone under our enhanced quality system."

Fiscal 2010 Outlook for CareFusion
For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010, CareFusion expects mid single-digit revenue growth compared to fiscal 2009 pro forma revenue of $3.7 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share
7
for fiscal 2010 are expected to be between $1.10 and $1.20, compared to fiscal 2009 pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.54, or $1.32 on an unadjusted basis. The pro forma financials reflect CareFusion results as if the separation and related transactions had already occurred.
8
The expected year-over-year decline in adjusted diluted earnings per share is primarily driven by an incremental $100 million to $110 million in spending CareFusion will incur due to several factors including higher compensation expense, R&D spending and costs to stand up infrastructure as a new public company. In addition the company expects a significant increase in the tax rate from fiscal 2009 to 2010, due primarily to a one-time tax benefit received in 2009.
The guidance for fiscal 2010 is based on an assumed diluted weighted average outstanding share count of 228 million and reflects a previously announced distribution ratio of 0.5 shares of CareFusion common stock for each common share of Cardinal Health held as of 5 p.m. EDT on Aug. 25.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations and effective tax rate from continuing operations. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast special items, impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net and other spin-off costs, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.
CareFusion presents the non-GAAP measure "adjusted diluted earnings per share" on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure for CareFusion is diluted earnings per share. CareFusion is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, because CareFusion cannot reliably forecast merger integration and restructuring costs and acquired in-process research and development costs. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact CareFusion's future financial results.

Exhibit 99.2
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), Cardinal Health, Inc.'s ("Cardinal Health's") earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by Cardinal Health should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by Cardinal Health may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Cardinal Health has provided reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measures. Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental metrics to assist readers. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures are included in the earnings release.
Cardinal Health presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP operating earnings" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net.
Non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation).
A restructuring activity is a program whereby Cardinal Health fundamentally changes its operations such as closing facilities, moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re-alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. Restructuring charges are recognized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." Under SFAS No. 146, a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which it is incurred except for a liability for a one-time termination benefit which is recognized over its future service period.
Acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate acquired companies. Upon acquisition, certain integration charges are recognized as incurred within selling, general and administrative expenses in accordance with SFAS No. 141 and other integration charges are recognized as special items as incurred.
Cardinal Health recognizes income from the favorable outcome of legal settlements, judgments or other resolution of legal and regulatory matters as special items on the consolidated financial statements when the associated cash or assets are received. Generally, expenses due to the unfavorable outcome of legal settlements, judgments or other resolution of legal and regulatory matters ("litigation settlement losses") are charged to the segment to which the matter relates and, as a result, are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses on Cardinal Health's consolidated financial statements. In certain circumstances, significant litigation settlement losses are classified in special items on the consolidated statement of earnings. Factors considered in determining whether a particular litigation settlement loss should be classified in special items include the size of settlement, the nature of the matter (i.e., significant matters that are infrequent, non-recurring or unusual in nature are classified as special items), the age of the matter and the pervasiveness of the matter to the entire organization. Cardinal Health also classifies legal fees and document preservation and production costs incurred in connection with the previously-disclosed SEC investigation and related Audit Committee internal review and related matters as special itemsFor information regarding these investigations, see Cardinal Health's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, as amended.
.
Cardinal Health classifies certain asset impairments related to restructurings in special items. Asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets not eligible to be classified as special items or discontinued operations are classified within impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net within the consolidated statements of earnings.
For further discussion of items classified as special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net, see the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Cardinal Health's Annual and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
On July 10, 2009, Cardinal Health's Board of Directors approved the spin-off (the "Spin-Off") of Cardinal Health's clinical and medical products businesses through the distribution of at least 80.1 percent of the outstanding common stock of the spin-off company, CareFusion Corporation ("CareFusion"), to Cardinal Health's shareholders. Beginning the second quarter of fiscal 2009, this non-GAAP measure also excludes costs incurred in connection with the Spin-Off that are not included in special items or impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net. These costs are referred to hereinafter as the "Other Spin-Off Costs."
Management uses non-GAAP operating earnings to evaluate Cardinal Health's performance. As Cardinal Health's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use financial measures that do not include charges and gains associated with restructuring activities, integrating acquisitions, significant litigation settlements, asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets. While these special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net may be recurring, management believes that these items and charges are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions, without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of Cardinal Health's core business. The Other Spin-Off Costs are excluded for similar reasons.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that the measure excludes items that impact Cardinal Health's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to Cardinal Health. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with operating earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net separately and in the aggregate when reviewing Cardinal Health's performance, as well as the Other Spin-Off Costs.

See the discussion of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of Cardinal Health's special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net classifications.

See the discussion of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of Cardinal Health's special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net classifications. Beginning the second quarter of fiscal 2009, this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes the Other Spin-Off Costs, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. In addition, due to the classification of Cardinal Health's former Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment ("PTS") as discontinued operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, the numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes a loss of $7.6 million on the sale of PTS recorded, net of tax, in discontinued operations. The adjustment related to the PTS sale is referred to hereinafter as the "PTS Adjustment."
Non-GAAP return on equity.
Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate Cardinal Health's performance. As Cardinal Health's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry, management finds it useful to use financial measures that do not include charges and gains associated with restructuring activities, integrating acquisitions, significant litigation settlements, asset impairments and gains and losses from the sale of assets. While these special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net may be recurring, management believes that these items and charges are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions, without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of Cardinal Health's core business. The Other Spin-Off Costs and PTS Adjustment are excluded for similar reasons.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that this measure excludes items that impact Cardinal Health's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to Cardinal Health. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with return on equity (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net separately and in the aggregate when reviewing Cardinal Health's performance, as well as the Other Spin-Off Costs and the PTS Adjustment.
Cardinal Health presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on invested capital." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items, net of tax, and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of Cardinal Health's special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net classifications. Beginning the second quarter of fiscal 2009, non-GAAP financial measure also excludes the Other Spin-Off Costs, net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. Due to the classification of Cardinal Health's former PTS segment as discontinued operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, the numerator in calculating this non-GAAP financial measure also excludes the PTS Adjustment.

Cardinal Health presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding the components of Cardinal Health's special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net classifications. Beginning the second quarter of fiscal 2009, this non-GAAP financial measure excludes the Other Spin-Off Costs from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of the Other Spin-Off Costs from the numerator of the calculation. Management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate Cardinal Health's performance because special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net may be taxed differently than other items. The Other Spin-Off Costs are excluded for similar reasons.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations.
The limitation associated with using this non-GAAP measure is that this measure excludes items that impact Cardinal Health's current period operating results. In most cases, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to Cardinal Health. This limitation is best addressed by using this non-GAAP measure in combination with effective tax rate from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP measure) because the non-GAAP measure does not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find this non-GAAP measure useful to evaluate Cardinal Health's future performance because special items and impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net may have a different tax impact than other items, as well as the Other Spin-Off Costs.
Cardinal Health also presents the non-GAAP financial measure "net debt to capital," which is net debt divided by capital (net debt plus total shareholders' equity). "Net debt," also a non-GAAP financial measure, is debt (the most comparable GAAP measure, calculated as long-term obligations plus short-term borrowings) minus cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale. Management believes that net debt to capital is an important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet. With respect to net debt, cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale are subtracted from the GAAP measure because they could be used to reduce Cardinal Health's debt obligations.
Net debt to capital.
The limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and equivalents and short-term investments available for sale and therefore may imply that there is less Cardinal Health debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. This limitation is best addressed by using net debt in combination with debt because net debt may be lower than the most comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that investors may find it useful to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet.
CareFusion presents the non-GAAP financial measure "adjusted diluted earnings per share." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes merger integration and restructuring costs (which includes one-time costs associated with the Spin-Off) and acquired in-process research and development.
CareFusion adjusted diluted earnings per share.
 
A restructuring activity is a program whereby CareFusion fundamentally changes its operations such as closing facilities, moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re-alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. Restructuring charges are recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." Under SFAS No. 146, a liability is measured at its fair value and recognized as incurred. Acquired in-process research and development ("IPR&D") costs include the write-off of research and development projects in process at the time of acquisition, which had not yet reached technological feasibility and were deemed to have no alternative future use.
CareFusion management uses this non-GAAP measure to evaluate CareFusion's performance. As CareFusion's core business is providing healthcare products and services to the healthcare industry, its management finds it useful to use financial measures that do not include charges and gains associated with restructuring activities and integrating acquisitions. While these items may be recurring, CareFusion management believes that these items and charges are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of its products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions, without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of CareFusion's core business.

CareFusion management believes that investors may find it useful to evaluate the components of merger integration and restructuring costs and acquired in-process research and development separately and in the aggregate when reviewing CareFusion's performance.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations and effective tax rate from continuing operations. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast special items, impairments, (gain)/loss on sale of assets and other, net and other spin-off costs, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.

The Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries ("Cardinal Health") unaudited adjusted consolidated financial statements included below consist of unaudited adjusted consolidated statements of earnings for the quarters ended September 30, December 31, March 31 and June 30, 2009 and 2008 and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, unaudited adjusted consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2009 and 2008, and unaudited adjusted consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008. The unaudited adjusted consolidated financial statements included below have been derived from the historical consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cardinal Health and have been adjusted to present the estimated impact of the removal of the CareFusion businesses from the historical financial results of Cardinal Health. They do not show the planned distribution by CareFusion of $1.4 billion in cash to Cardinal Health in connection with the planned spin-off and the planned use of that cash to reduce Cardinal Health long-term obligations. Certain surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management businesses that are currently part of the Clinical and Medical Products segment will be retained by Cardinal Health and will continue to be presented within continuing operations.
The unaudited adjusted consolidated financial statements do not necessarily reflect the financial position and results of operations that will be presented within Cardinal Health's consolidated financial statements subsequent to the completion of the planned spin-off of CareFusion. In addition, they do not reflect what the financial position and results of operations would have been if Cardinal Health had actually operated without the CareFusion businesses during the periods shown nor are they necessarily indicative of Cardinal Health's future results of operations or financial condition. The assumptions and estimates used and adjustments derived from such assumptions are based on currently available information, and management believes such assumptions and estimates are reasonable under the circumstances.

The CareFusion Corporation ("CareFusion") unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included below consist of unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of earnings for the quarters ended September 30, December 31, March 31 and June 30, 2009 and 2008 and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included below have been derived from the historical consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cardinal Health and have been adjusted to present the estimated impact of removing certain businesses that manufacture and sell surgical and exam gloves, surgical drapes and apparel and fluid management products in the U.S. market that are currently part of the Clinical and Medical Products segment of Cardinal Health, and will be retained by Cardinal Health following the spin-off.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not necessarily reflect the financial position and results of operations that will be presented within CareFusion's condensed combined financial statements subsequent to the completion of the planned spin-off from Cardinal Health. In addition, they do not reflect what the financial position and results of operations would have been if CareFusion had actually operated as a stand-alone publicly traded company. The assumptions and estimates used and pro forma adjustments derived from such assumptions are based on currently available information, and management believes such assumptions and estimates are reasonable under the circumstances.
