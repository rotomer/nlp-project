On August 27, 2009, Cardinal Health, Inc. ("Cardinal Health"), as the sole stockholder of CareFusion Corporation ("CareFusion"), then a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardinal Health, approved the CareFusion Corporation 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP"). As a result of the approval by CareFusion's sole stockholder, the LTIP became effective as of August 31, 2009. The term of the LTIP will end on the earlier to occur of: (i) the date the LTIP is terminated in accordance with its terms; or (ii) August 31, 2019. As a result of the separation of CareFusion from Cardinal Health effective August 31, 2009 (the "CareFusion separation"), certain of Cardinal Health's named executives have received CareFusion equity awards under the LTIP in substitution of, or in connection with, adjustments made to outstanding Cardinal Health stock options and restricted share units ("RSUs") held by the named executives.
The LTIP permits CareFusion to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, other stock-based awards and cash awards. The total number of shares of CareFusion's common stock available for awards under the LTIP (subject to certain anti-dilution provisions of the LTIP) is 40,000,000 shares; provided that no more than 16,000,000 shares may be subject to awards that are issued under the LTIP in accordance with the terms of Article VI of the Employee Matters Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2009, by and between Cardinal Health and CareFusion (the "Employee Matters Agreement"), in substitution of, or in connection with, adjustments made to outstanding stock options, restricted shares and RSUs that were granted under the Cardinal Health, Inc. 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated as of November 5, 2008, and any similar plan sponsored or assumed by Cardinal Health or any of its affiliates.
The LTIP provides that it shall be administered by the CareFusion board of directors, a committee appointed by the CareFusion board of directors, or their respective delegates.
The LTIP approved by Cardinal Health, as the sole stockholder of CareFusion, is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to CareFusion's Registration Statement on Form S-8 (File No. 333-161615), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 28, 2009. The foregoing description of the LTIP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the LTIP.
 
On August 28, 2009, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of Cardinal Health's Board of Directors approved term sheets setting forth the adjusted terms of outstanding Cardinal Health stock options and RSUs and the terms of CareFusion stock options and RSUs issued pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement in substitution of, or in connection with, adjustments made to outstanding Cardinal Health stock options and RSUs held by the named executives continuing with Cardinal Health. The terms of CareFusion stock options and RSUs granted to named executives continuing with Cardinal Health are the same as the terms of Cardinal Health equity awards to which they relate other than the number of shares covered by the awards and the stock option exercise price. Vesting and other service-based provisions relate to the named executives' service with Cardinal Health and the restrictive covenants relate to service with both Cardinal Health and CareFusion. The term sheets are filed as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3 to this report. The foregoing description of the term sheets is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such term sheets.
 
On September 1, 2009, Cardinal Health issued a news release announcing that it had completed the spin-off of CareFusion through the pro rata distribution of approximately 81% of the shares of CareFusion common stock to Cardinal Health's shareholders. A copy of the news release is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.

These Nonqualified Stock Option Terms and Conditions (the "Terms") adjust and restate the terms that apply to the Cardinal Health Options (as defined below) for purposes of applying such terms to the nonqualified stock options (the "CareFusion Options") granted to Awardee by CareFusion Corporation (the "Company") under the CareFusion Corporation 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") as a result of the separation of the clinical and medical products businesses of Cardinal Health, Inc. ("Cardinal Health") by means of a spin-off of at least 80.1% of the outstanding common stock of the Company to Cardinal Health's shareholders, effective on August 31, 2009 (the "Spin-Off"). These Terms, together with the Option Terms (as defined below) and the Plan, shall govern the CareFusion Options. The CareFusion Options are Replacement Awards under the Plan.
The "Number of Shares" that are covered by the CareFusion Options and the "Exercise Price per Share" of the CareFusion Options constitute the option terms (the "Option Terms") and can be found on the website of the Company's third-party equity plan administrator. The extent to which the CareFusion Options shall vest and become exercisable on and after specific dates (the "Vesting Date(s)"), subject in each case to the provisions of these Terms, including those relating to Awardee's continued employment with Cardinal Health and its Affiliates (collectively, the "Cardinal Group") and the date on which the CareFusion Options shall expire (the "Grant Expiration Date") are the same terms as those set forth (i) in Awardee's stock option agreement(s) for stock option awards granted to Awardee by Cardinal Health or one of its Affiliates (the "Cardinal Health Options") on the grant date specified in the agreement for such Cardinal Health Options (the "Pre-Spin Grant Date") or (ii) on the website of the Company's third-party equity plan administrator in the event that Awardee participated in Cardinal Health's Offer to Exchange, effective June 19, 2009 (each of (i) and (ii), the "Cardinal Option Agreement").
Capitalized terms used in these Terms which are not specifically defined herein will have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan.
1. .
Method of Exercise and Payment of Price
(a) . At any time when all or a portion of the CareFusion Options is exercisable under the Plan and these Terms, some or all of the exercisable portion of the CareFusion Options may be exercised from time to time by written notice to the Company, or such other method of exercise as may be specified by the Company, including, without limitation, exercise by electronic means on the website of the Company's third-party equity plan administrator, which will:
Method of Exercise
(i) state the number of whole Shares with respect to which the CareFusion Options are being exercised; and
(ii) if the CareFusion Options are being exercised by anyone other than Awardee, if not already provided, be accompanied by proof satisfactory to counsel for the Company of the right of such person or persons to exercise the CareFusion Options under the Plan and all Applicable Laws and regulations.

(b) . The full exercise price for the portion of the CareFusion Options being exercised shall be paid to the Company as provided below:
Payment of Price
(i) in cash;
(ii) by check or wire transfer (denominated in U.S. Dollars);
(iii) subject to any conditions or limitations established by the Administrator, other Shares which (A) in the case of Shares acquired from the Company (whether upon the exercise of the CareFusion Options or otherwise), have been owned by the Participant for more than six (6) months on the date of surrender (unless this condition is waived by the Administrator), and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to or greater than the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said CareFusion Options shall be exercised (it being agreed that the excess of the Fair Market Value over the aggregate exercise price shall be refunded to Awardee, with any fractional Share being repaid in cash);
(iv) consideration received by the Company under a broker-assisted sale and remittance program acceptable to the Administrator; or
(v) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.
2. . The CareFusion Options shall be transferable (I) at Awardee's death, by Awardee by will or pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution, and (II) by Awardee during Awardee's lifetime, without payment of consideration, to (a) the spouse, former spouse, parents, stepparents, grandparents, parents-in-law, siblings, siblings-in-law, children, stepchildren, children-in-law, grandchildren, nieces or nephews of Awardee, or any other persons sharing Awardee's household (other than tenants or employees) (collectively, "Family Members"), (b) a trust or trusts for the primary benefit of Awardee or such Family Members, (c) a foundation in which Awardee or such Family Members control the management of assets, or (d) a partnership in which Awardee or such Family Members are the majority or controlling partners; , , that subsequent transfers of the transferred CareFusion Options shall be prohibited, except (X) if the transferee is an individual, at the transferee's death by the transferee by will or pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution, and (Y) without payment of consideration to the individuals or entities listed in subparagraphs II(a), (b) or (c), above, with respect to the original Awardee. The Administrator may, in its discretion, permit transfers to other persons and entities as permitted by the Plan. Neither a transfer under a domestic relations order in settlement of marital property rights nor a transfer to an entity in which more than 50% of the voting interests are owned by Awardee or Family Members in exchange for an interest in that entity shall be considered to be a transfer for consideration. Within ten (10) days of any transfer, Awardee shall notify the Compensation and Benefits department of the Company in writing of the transfer. Following transfer, the CareFusion Options shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer and, except as otherwise provided in the Plan or these Terms, references to the original Awardee shall be deemed to refer to the transferee. The events of a Termination of Employment of Awardee provided in paragraph 3 hereof shall continue to be applied with respect to the original Awardee, following which the CareFusion Options shall be exercisable by the transferee only to the extent, and for the periods, specified in paragraph 3. The Company shall have no obligation to notify

any transferee of Awardee's Termination of Employment with the Cardinal Group for any reason. The conduct prohibited of Awardee in paragraphs 5 and 6 hereof shall continue to be prohibited of Awardee following transfer to the same extent as immediately prior to transfer and the CareFusion Options (or its economic value, as applicable) shall be subject to forfeiture by the transferee and recoupment from Awardee to the same extent as would have been the case of Awardee had the CareFusion Options not been transferred. Awardee shall remain subject to the recoupment provisions of paragraphs 5 and 6 of these Terms and tax withholding provisions of Section 31 of the Plan following transfer of the CareFusion Options.
3. .
Termination of Employment
(a) . If a Termination of Employment occurs by reason of death or Disability prior to the vesting in full of the CareFusion Options, but at least six (6) months from the Pre-Spin Grant Date, then any unvested portion of the CareFusion Options shall vest upon and become exercisable in full from and after such Termination of Employment due to death or Disability. The CareFusion Options may thereafter be exercised by Awardee, any transferee of Awardee, if applicable, or by the legal representative of the estate or by the legatee of Awardee under the will of Awardee from the date of such Termination of Employment due to death or Disability until the Grant Expiration Date.
Termination of Employment by Reason of Death or Disability
(b) . If a Termination of Employment occurs by reason of Retirement prior to the vesting in full of the CareFusion Options, but at least six (6) months from the Pre-Spin Grant Date, then a Ratable Portion of each installment of the CareFusion Options that would have vested on each future Vesting Date shall immediately vest and become exercisable. Such Ratable Portion shall, with respect to the applicable installment, be an amount equal to such installment of the CareFusion Options scheduled to vest on the applicable Vesting Date multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days from the Pre-Spin Grant Date through the date of such termination, and the denominator of which shall be the number of days from the Pre-Spin Grant Date through such Vesting Date. The CareFusion Options, to the extent vested, may be exercised by Awardee (or any transferee, if applicable) until the Grant Expiration Date. If Awardee dies after Retirement, but before the Grant Expiration Date, the CareFusion Options, to the extent vested, may be exercised by any transferee of the CareFusion Options, if applicable, or by the legal representative of the estate or by the legatee of Awardee under the will of Awardee from and after such death until the Grant Expiration Date. For purposes of these Terms and this Award under the Plan, "Retirement" shall refer to Age 55 Retirement, which means Termination of Employment by a Participant (other than by reason of death or Disability and other than in the event of Termination for Cause) from the Cardinal Group (i) after attaining age fifty-five (55), and (ii) having at least ten (10) years of continuous service with Cardinal Health and its Affiliates, including service with an Affiliate of Cardinal Health prior to the time that such Affiliate became an Affiliate of Cardinal Health. For purposes of the age and/or service requirement, the Administrator may, in its discretion, credit a Participant with additional age and/or years of service.
Termination of Employment by Reason of Retirement
(c) If (i) an Awardee's Termination of Employment occurs within fifteen (15) months after, and as a result of, the Spin-Off, and (ii) Awardee was classified as an executive-level employee in accordance with Cardinal Health's human resources system as of Awardee's Termination of Employment or had at least ten (10) years of continuous service with the Cardinal Group, including service with an Affiliate of Cardinal Health prior to the time that such Affiliate became an Affiliate of Cardinal Health, the CareFusion Options, to the extent vested, may be exercised by

Awardee (or any transferee, if applicable) until the earlier of the second (2
nd
) anniversary of such Termination of Employment (or any later date until which it would remain exercisable by its terms) or the Grant Expiration Date.
(d) . If a Termination of Employment occurs by any reason other than death, Retirement, or Disability (each at least six (6) months from the Pre-Spin Grant Date), any portion of the CareFusion Options which has not vested on such date of Termination of Employment will automatically be forfeited. Subject to paragraph 7 below and subparagraphs 3(a), (b) and (c) above, Awardee (or any transferee, if applicable) will have 90 days from the date of Termination of Employment or until the Grant Expiration Date, whichever period is shorter, to exercise any portion of the CareFusion Options that is vested and exercisable on the date of Termination of Employment; , , that if the Termination of Employment was a Termination for Cause, as determined by the Administrator, the CareFusion Options may be immediately canceled by the Administrator (whether then held by Awardee or any transferee).

4. . The CareFusion Options are subject to all restrictions in these Terms and/or in the Plan. As a condition of any exercise of the CareFusion Options, the Company may require Awardee or his or her transferee or successor to make any representation and warranty to comply with any Applicable Law or regulation or to confirm any factual matters (including Awardee's compliance with the terms of paragraphs 5 and 6 of these Terms or any employment or severance agreement between Awardee and any member of the Cardinal Group) reasonably requested by the Company. The CareFusion Options shall not be exercisable if such exercise would involve a violation of any Applicable Law.
Restrictions on Exercise
5. .
Triggering Conduct/Competitor Triggering Conduct
(a) As used in these Terms, "Triggering Conduct" shall include the following:
(i) for so long as Awardee is an employee of the Cardinal Group and for three (3) years following Termination of Employment, regardless of the reason,
(A) other than in the performance of duties assigned by the Cardinal Group, disclosing or using in any capacity any confidential information, trade secrets or other business sensitive information or material concerning the Cardinal Group;
(B) a violation of policies of the Cardinal Group, including, but not limited to, conduct which would constitute a breach of any certificate of compliance or similar attestation/certification signed by Awardee;
(C) directly or indirectly employing, contacting concerning employment, or participating in any way in the recruitment for employment of (whether as an employee, officer, director, agent, consultant or independent contractor) any person who was or is an employee, representative, officer or director of the Cardinal Group at any time within the 12 months prior to Awardee's Termination of Employment;
(D) any action by Awardee and/or his or her representatives that either does or could reasonably be expected to undermine, diminish or otherwise damage the relationship between the Cardinal Group and any of its customers, potential customers, vendors and/or suppliers that were known to Awardee; and

(E) breaching any provision of any employment or severance agreement with a member of the Cardinal Group; and
(ii) for three (3) years following the effective time of the Spin-Off,
(A) other than in the performance of duties assigned by the Cardinal Group, disclosing or using in any capacity any confidential information, trade secrets or other business sensitive information or material concerning the CareFusion Group;
(B) other than in the performance of duties assigned by the Cardinal Group, directly or indirectly employing, contacting concerning employment, or participating in any way in the recruitment for employment of (whether as an employee, officer, director, agent, consultant or independent contractor) any person who was or is an employee, representative, officer or director of the CareFusion Group at any time within the 12 months prior to the effective time of the Spin-Off; and
(C) other than in the performance of duties assigned by the Cardinal Group, any action by Awardee and/or his or her representatives that either does or could reasonably be expected to undermine, diminish or otherwise damage the relationship between the CareFusion Group and any of its customers, potential customers, vendors and/or suppliers that were known to Awardee.
For purposes of these Terms, "CareFusion Group" means the Company and any Subsidiary or other entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by the Company or any entity in which the Company has a significant ownership interest as determined by the Administrator.
(b) As used in these Terms, "Competitor Triggering Conduct" shall include:
(i) during Awardee's employment or within one (1) year following Awardee's Termination of Employment, accepting employment with, or serving as a consultant or advisor or in any other capacity to, an entity that is in competition with the business conducted by any member of the Cardinal Group (a "Cardinal Competitor"), including, but not limited to, employment or another business relationship with any Cardinal Competitor if Awardee has been introduced to trade secrets, confidential information or business sensitive information during Awardee's employment with the Cardinal Group and such information would aid the Cardinal Competitor because the threat of disclosure of such information is so great that, for purposes of these Terms, it must be assumed that such disclosure would occur; and
(ii) within one (1) year following the effective time of the Spin-Off, other than in the performance of duties assigned by the Cardinal Group, accepting employment with, or serving as a consultant or advisor or in any other capacity to, an entity that is in competition with the business conducted by any member of the CareFusion Group (a "CareFusion Competitor"), including, but not limited to, employment or another business relationship with any CareFusion Competitor if Awardee has been introduced to trade secrets, confidential information or business sensitive information during Awardee's

employment with the businesses that comprised the CareFusion Group prior to the effective time of the Spin-Off and such information would aid the CareFusion Competitor because the threat of disclosure of such information is so great that, for purposes of these Terms, it must be assumed that such disclosure would occur.
6. . Awardee agrees not to engage in Triggering Conduct during the applicable time periods set forth in paragraph 5 hereof. If Awardee engages in Triggering Conduct or Competitor Triggering Conduct during the applicable time periods set forth in paragraph 5, then:
Special Forfeiture/Repayment Rules
(a) the CareFusion Options (or any part thereof that has not been exercised) shall immediately and automatically terminate, be forfeited, and shall cease to be exercisable at any time; and
(b) Awardee shall, within thirty (30) days following written notice from the Company, pay the Company an amount equal to the gross option gain realized or obtained by Awardee or any transferee resulting from the exercise of such CareFusion Options, measured at the date of exercise (, the difference between the market value of the Shares underlying the CareFusion Options on the exercise date and the exercise price paid for such Shares underlying the CareFusion Options), with respect to any portion of the CareFusion Options that has already been exercised at any time within three (3) years prior to the Triggering Conduct (the "Look-Back Period"), less $1.00. If Awardee engages only in Competitor Triggering Conduct, then the Look-Back Period shall be shortened to exclude any period more than one (1) year prior to Awardee's Termination of Employment (or, in the case of Competitor Triggering Conduct as defined in paragraph 5(b)(ii) above, one (1) year prior to the effective time of the Spin-Off), but include any period between the time of Termination of Employment or the effective time of the Spin-Off, as applicable, and engagement in Competitor Triggering Conduct. Awardee may be released from Awardee's obligations under this paragraph 6 if and only if the Administrator (or its duly appointed designee) and a duly authorized representative of Cardinal Health determine, in writing and in their sole discretion, that such action is in the best interests of both Cardinal Health and the Company. Nothing in this paragraph 6 constitutes a so-called "noncompete" covenant. This paragraph 6 does, however, prohibit certain conduct while Awardee is associated with either the Cardinal Group or the CareFusion Group and thereafter and does provide for the forfeiture or repayment of the benefits granted by these Terms under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, Awardee's acceptance of employment with a Cardinal Competitor or a CareFusion Competitor. Awardee agrees to provide the Company with at least ten (10) days' written notice prior to directly or indirectly accepting employment with or serving as a consultant or advisor or in any other capacity to a Cardinal Competitor or a CareFusion Competitor, and further agrees to inform any such new employer, before accepting employment, of the terms of this paragraph 6 and Awardee's continuing obligations contained herein. No provisions of these Terms shall diminish, negate or otherwise impact any separate noncompete or other agreement to which Awardee may be a party, including, but not limited to, any certificate of compliance or similar attestation/certification signed by Awardee; , , that to the extent that any provisions contained in any other agreement are inconsistent in any manner with the restrictions and covenants of Awardee contained in these Terms, the provisions of these Terms shall take precedence and such other inconsistent provisions shall be null and void. Awardee has acknowledged and agreed that these restrictions are for the benefit of Cardinal Health in consideration of Awardee's receipt of the Cardinal Health Options, in consideration of employment, in consideration of exposing Awardee to Cardinal Health's business operations and confidential information, and for other good and valuable consideration, the adequacy of which consideration is hereby expressly confirmed. Awardee has further acknowledged that the receipt

PTIONS

AND

of the Cardinal Health Options and the execution of the Cardinal Option Agreement were voluntary actions on the part of Awardee and that Cardinal Health would have been unwilling to provide the Cardinal Health Options to Awardee without including the restrictions and covenants of Awardee set forth above. Further, Awardee and Cardinal Health have agreed and acknowledged that the provisions contained in paragraphs 5 and 6 are ancillary to, or part of, an otherwise enforceable agreement at the time the Cardinal Option Agreement was made.
7. . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (a) in the event a Change of Control occurs (, a Change of Control occurs with respect to the Company), then the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Plan shall not apply and the CareFusion Options shall continue to vest and become exercisable in accordance with the terms set forth herein, and (b) in the event a "change of control" (as defined in the Cardinal Health, Inc. 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective as of November 5, 2008) occurs with respect to Cardinal Health, the following acceleration and exercisability provisions shall apply:
Change of Control
i.e.
(i) On the date that such "change of control" occurs, any unvested CareFusion Options shall vest in full.
(ii) In the event of an Awardee's Termination of Employment within two (2) years after a "change of control" for any reason other than because of Awardee's death, Retirement, Disability or Termination for Cause, each CareFusion Option held by Awardee (or a transferee) that is then vested shall, following such Termination of Employment, remain exercisable until the earlier of the third (3rd) anniversary of such Termination of Employment (or any later date until which it would remain exercisable by its terms) or the expiration of its original term.
8. . By having accepted the Cardinal Health Options, Awardee has agreed that, so long as the amounts are not treated as "non-qualified deferred compensation" under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (a) any amounts Awardee owes from time to time to any member of the Cardinal Group with respect to the CareFusion Options may be deducted from, and set-off against, any amounts owed to Awardee by any member of the Cardinal Group from time to time (including, but not limited to, amounts owed to Awardee as wages, severance payments or other fringe benefits) and (b) any amounts Awardee owes from time to time to any member of the CareFusion Group with respect to the CareFusion Options may be deducted from, and set-off against, any amounts owed to Awardee by any member of the CareFusion Group from time to time (including, but not limited to, amounts owed to Awardee as wages, severance payments or other fringe benefits).
Right of Set-Off
9. .
Withholding Tax
(a) . Awardee is liable and responsible for all taxes owed in connection with the exercise of the CareFusion Options, regardless of any action the Company or Cardinal Health take with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the CareFusion Options. Neither the Company nor Cardinal Health makes any representation or undertaking regarding the tax treatment or the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the exercise of the CareFusion Options. The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the CareFusion Options or the exercise of the CareFusion Options to reduce or eliminate Awardee's tax liability.
Generally
(b) . Concurrently with the payment of the exercise price pursuant to paragraph 1 hereof, Awardee is required to arrange for the satisfaction of the
Payment of Withholding Taxes

minimum amount of any domestic or foreign tax withholding obligation, whether national, federal, state or local, including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation") in a manner acceptable to both Cardinal Health and the Company. Any manner provided for in subparagraph 1(b) hereof shall be deemed an acceptable manner to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation unless otherwise determined by the Company.
10. . The CareFusion Options are governed by the laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, except to the extent superseded by the laws of the United States of America. Awardee has acknowledged that the terms relating to Triggering Conduct, Competitor Triggering Conduct and special forfeiture and repayment rules set forth above are reasonable in nature, are fundamental for the protection of legitimate business and proprietary interests, and do not adversely affect Awardee's ability to earn a living in any capacity that does not violate such terms. In the event of any violation by Awardee of any such covenants, immediate and irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law will result. In the event of any violation or attempted violations of these restrictions and covenants, the Cardinal Group or the CareFusion Group, as the case may be, will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief or other equitable relief, including the issuance ex parte of a temporary restraining order, without any showing of irreparable harm or damage, such irreparable harm being acknowledged and admitted by Awardee, waiving any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies afforded the Cardinal Group or CareFusion Group, as the case may be, hereunder or by law. In the event that it becomes necessary for the Cardinal Group or CareFusion Group to institute legal proceedings under Awardee's CareFusion Options, Awardee will be responsible for all costs and reasonable legal fees with regard to such proceedings. Any term relating to the CareFusion Options which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable should be construed or limited in a manner that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to the business objectives intended by such term, without invalidating or rendering unenforceable the remaining terms.
Governing Law/Venue for Dispute Resolution/Costs and Legal Fees
Awardee has agreed that the laws of the State of Ohio bear a substantial relationship to the Cardinal Health Options and that the benefits granted therein, and thus the CareFusion Options and the benefits granted thereunder, would not be granted without their governance by the laws of the State of Ohio. In addition, all legal actions or proceedings relevant to the CareFusion Options will be brought exclusively in state or federal courts located in Franklin County, Ohio, and Awardee has consented to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
11. .The interpretation of these Terms shall rest exclusively and completely within the sole discretion of the Administrator. Awardee shall be bound by the decisions of the Administrator with regard to the interpretation of these Terms and with regard to any and all matters set forth in these Terms. The Administrator may delegate its functions under these Terms to an officer of the CareFusion Group designated by the Administrator (hereinafter the "designee"). In fulfilling its responsibilities hereunder, the Administrator or its designee may rely upon documents, written statements of the parties or such other material as the Administrator or its designee deems appropriate. Awardee shall not have any right to be heard or to appear before the Administrator or its designee and any decision of the Administrator or its designee relating to these Terms, including without limitation whether particular conduct constitutes Triggering Conduct or Competitor Triggering Conduct, shall be final and binding unless such decision is arbitrary and capricious.

These Restricted Share Units Terms and Conditions (the "Terms") adjust and restate the terms that apply to the Cardinal Health RSUs (as defined below) for purposes of applying such terms to the restricted share units (the "CareFusion RSUs") granted to Awardee by CareFusion Corporation (the "Company") under the CareFusion Corporation 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") as a result of the separation of the clinical and medical products businesses of Cardinal Health, Inc. ("Cardinal Health") by means of a spin-off of at least 80.1% of the outstanding common stock of the Company to Cardinal Health's shareholders, effective on August 31, 2009 (the "Spin-Off"). These Terms, together with the RSU Terms (as defined below) and the Plan, shall govern the CareFusion RSUs. The CareFusion RSUs are Replacement Awards under the Plan.
The "Number of Shares" that are covered by the CareFusion RSUs constitute the RSU terms (the "RSU Terms") and can be found on the website of the Company's third-party equity plan administrator. The extent to which the CareFusion RSUs shall vest on and after specific dates (the "Vesting Date(s)"), subject in each case to the provisions of these Terms, including those relating to Awardee's continued employment with Cardinal Health and its Affiliates (collectively, the "Cardinal Group"), is the same as set forth in Awardee's award agreement (the "Cardinal Health RSU Agreement") for the restricted share units granted to Awardee by Cardinal Health or one of its Affiliates (the "Cardinal Health RSUs") on the grant date specified in the Cardinal Health RSU Agreement (the "Pre-Spin Grant Date").
Capitalized terms used in these Terms which are not specifically defined herein will have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Plan.

General
(b) . If a Termination of Employment occurs prior to the vesting in full of the CareFusion RSUs by reason of Awardee's death or Disability, but at least six (6) months from the Pre-Spin Grant Date, then any unvested CareFusion RSUs shall immediately vest in full and shall not be forfeited.
Death and Disability
(c) . If a Termination of Employment occurs prior to the vesting in full of the CareFusion RSUs by reason of Awardee's Retirement, but at least six (6) months from the Pre-Spin Grant Date, then a Ratable Portion of each installment of the CareFusion RSUs that would have vested on each future Vesting Date shall immediately vest and not be forfeited. Such Ratable Portion shall, with respect to the applicable installment, be an amount equal to such installment of the CareFusion RSUs scheduled to vest on the applicable Vesting Date multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days from the Pre-Spin Grant Date through the date of such termination, and the denominator of which shall be the number of days

from the Pre-Spin Grant Date through such Vesting Date.

For purposes of the age and/or service requirement, the Administrator may, in its discretion, credit a Participant with additional age and/or years of service.
3. .
Triggering Conduct/Competitor Triggering Conduct
(a) As used in these Terms, "Triggering Conduct" shall include the following:
(i) for so long as Awardee is an employee of the Cardinal Group and for three (3) years following Termination of Employment, regardless of the reason,
(A) other than in the performance of duties assigned by the Cardinal Group, disclosing or using in any capacity any confidential information, trade secrets or other business sensitive information or material concerning the Cardinal Group;

(C) directly or indirectly employing, contacting concerning employment, or participating in any way in the recruitment for employment of (whether as an employee, officer, director, agent, consultant or independent contractor) any person who was or is an employee, representative, officer or director of the Cardinal Group at any time within the 12 months prior to Awardee's Termination of Employment;
(D) any action by Awardee and/or his or her representatives that either does or could reasonably be expected to undermine, diminish or otherwise damage the relationship between the Cardinal Group and any of its customers, potential customers, vendors and/or suppliers that were known to Awardee; and

employee, officer, director, agent, consultant or independent contractor) any person who was or is an employee, representative, officer or director of the CareFusion Group at any time within the 12 months prior to the effective time of the Spin-Off; and
(C) other than in the performance of duties assigned by the Cardinal Group, any action by Awardee and/or his or her representatives that either does or could reasonably be expected to undermine, diminish or otherwise damage the relationship between the CareFusion Group and any of its customers, potential customers, vendors and/or suppliers that were known to Awardee.
For purposes of these Terms, "CareFusion Group" means the Company and any Subsidiary or other entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by the Company or any entity in which the Company has a significant ownership interest as determined by the Administrator.
(b) As used in these Terms, "Competitor Triggering Conduct" shall include:
(i) during Awardee's employment or within one (1) year following Awardee's Termination of Employment, accepting employment with, or serving as a consultant or advisor or in any other capacity to, an entity that is in competition with the business conducted by any member of the Cardinal Group (a "Cardinal Competitor"), including, but not limited to, employment or another business relationship with any Cardinal Competitor if Awardee has been introduced to trade secrets, confidential information or business sensitive information during Awardee's employment with the Cardinal Group and such information would aid the Cardinal Competitor because the threat of disclosure of such information is so great that, for purposes of these Terms, it must be assumed that such disclosure would occur; and
(ii) within one (1) year following the effective time of the Spin-Off, other than in the performance of duties assigned by the Cardinal Group, accepting employment with, or serving as a consultant or advisor or in any other capacity to, an entity that is in competition with the business conducted by any member of the CareFusion Group (a "CareFusion Competitor"), including, but not limited to, employment or another business relationship with any CareFusion Competitor if Awardee has been introduced to trade secrets, confidential information or business sensitive information during Awardee's employment with the businesses that comprised the CareFusion Group prior to the effective time of the Spin-Off and such information would aid the CareFusion Competitor because the threat of disclosure of such information is so great that, for purposes of these Terms, it must be assumed that such disclosure would occur.
4. . Awardee agrees not to engage in Triggering Conduct during the applicable time periods set forth in paragraph 3 hereof. If Awardee engages in Triggering Conduct or Competitor Triggering Conduct during the applicable time periods set forth in paragraph 3, then:
Special Forfeiture/Repayment Rules
(a) the CareFusion RSUs that have not yet vested or that vested within the Look-Back Period (as defined below) with respect to such Triggering Conduct or Competitor Triggering Conduct and have not yet been settled by a payment pursuant to paragraph 6 hereof shall immediately and automatically terminate, be forfeited, and shall cease to exist; and

AND

(b) Awardee shall, within thirty (30) days following written notice from the Company, pay to the Company an amount equal to (i) the aggregate gross gain realized or obtained by Awardee resulting from the settlement of all CareFusion RSUs pursuant to paragraph 6 hereof measured as of the settlement date (, the market value of the CareFusion RSUs on such settlement date), that have already been settled and that had vested at any time within three (3) years prior to the Triggering Conduct (the "Look-Back Period"), minus (ii) $1.00. If Awardee engages only in Competitor Triggering Conduct, then the Look-Back Period shall be shortened to exclude any period more than one (1) year prior to Awardee's Termination of Employment (or, in the case of Competitor Triggering Conduct as defined in paragraph 3(b)(ii), one (1) year prior to the effective time of the Spin-Off), but include any period between the time of Termination of Employment or the effective time of the Spin-Off, as applicable, and the time of engagement in Competitor Triggering Conduct. Awardee may be released from Awardee's obligations under this paragraph 4 if and only if the Administrator (or its duly appointed designee) and a duly authorized representative of Cardinal Health determine, in writing and in their sole discretion, that such action is in the best interests of both Cardinal Health and the Company. Nothing in this paragraph 4 constitutes a so-called "noncompete" covenant. This paragraph 4 does, however, prohibit certain conduct while Awardee is associated with either the Cardinal Group or the CareFusion Group and thereafter and does provide for the forfeiture or repayment of the benefits granted by these Terms under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, Awardee's acceptance of employment with a Cardinal Competitor or a CareFusion Competitor. Awardee agrees to provide the Company with at least ten (10) days' written notice prior to directly or indirectly accepting employment with or serving as a consultant or advisor or in any other capacity to a Cardinal Competitor or a CareFusion Competitor, and further agrees to inform any such new employer, before accepting employment, of the terms of this paragraph 4 and Awardee's continuing obligations contained herein. No provisions of these Terms shall diminish, negate or otherwise impact any separate noncompete or other agreement to which Awardee may be a party, including, but not limited to, any certificate of compliance or similar attestation/certification signed by Awardee; , , that to the extent that any provisions contained in any other agreement are inconsistent in any manner with the restrictions and covenants of Awardee contained in these Terms, the provisions of these Terms shall take precedence and such other inconsistent provisions shall be null and void. Awardee has acknowledged and agreed that these restrictions are for the benefit of Cardinal Health in consideration of Awardee's receipt of the Cardinal Health RSUs, in consideration of employment, in consideration of exposing Awardee to Cardinal Health's business operations and confidential information, and for other good and valuable consideration, the adequacy of which consideration is hereby expressly confirmed. Awardee has further acknowledged that the receipt of the Cardinal Health RSUs and the execution of the Cardinal Health RSU Agreements were voluntary actions on the part of Awardee and that Cardinal Health would have been unwilling to provide the Cardinal Health RSUs to Awardee without including the restrictions and covenants of Awardee set forth above. Further, Awardee and Cardinal Health have agreed and acknowledged that the provisions contained in paragraphs 3 and 4 are ancillary to, or part of, an otherwise enforceable agreement at the time the Cardinal Health RSU Agreements were made.

5. . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (a) in the event a Change of Control occurs (, a Change of Control occurs with respect to the Company), then the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Plan shall not apply and the CareFusion RSUs shall continue to vest in accordance with the terms set forth herein and (b) in the event a "change of control" (as defined in the Cardinal Health, Inc. 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective as of November 5, 2008) occurs with respect to Cardinal Health, on the date that such "change of control" occurs, the restrictions applicable to any unvested CareFusion RSUs shall lapse and the Award shall be fully vested.

6. . Awardee will be entitled to receive from the Company (without any payment on Awardee's behalf other than as described in Paragraph 10) the Shares represented by such CareFusion RSUs at the same time as Awardee is or would have been entitled to receive Cardinal Health common shares represented by the Cardinal Health RSUs.
Payment
7. . Awardee shall not receive cash dividends on the CareFusion RSUs, but instead shall, with respect to each CareFusion RSU, receive a cash payment from the Company on each cash dividend payment date with respect to the Shares with a record date between the effective time of the Spin-Off and the settlement of such unit pursuant to paragraph 6, with such cash payment to be in an amount equal to the dividend that would have been paid on the Common Share represented by such unit. Cash payments on each cash dividend payment date with respect to the Shares with a record date prior to a Vesting Date shall be accrued until the Vesting Date and paid thereon (subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying CareFusion RSUs). In addition, if Awardee was entitled to one or more cash dividend equivalent payments under the Cardinal Health RSUs that had not been paid prior to the effective time of the Spin-Off because the Cardinal Health RSUs had not yet vested, then the Company shall pay such cash payments on the Vesting Date.
Dividend Equivalents
8. . By having accepted the Cardinal Health RSUs, Awardee has agreed that, so long as the amounts are not treated as "non-qualified deferred compensation" under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (a) any amounts Awardee owes from time to time to any member of the Cardinal Group with respect to the CareFusion RSUs may be deducted from, and set-off against, any amounts owed to Awardee by any member of the Cardinal Group from time to time (including, but not limited to, amounts owed to Awardee as wages, severance payments or other fringe benefits) and (b) any amounts Awardee owes from time to time to any member of the CareFusion Group with respect to the CareFusion RSUs may be deducted from, and set-off against, any amounts owed to Awardee by any member of the CareFusion Group from time to time (including, but not limited to, amounts owed to Awardee as wages, severance payments or other fringe benefits).
Right of Set-Off
9. . Awardee shall have no rights of a stockholder with respect to the CareFusion RSUs, including, without limitation, the right to vote the Shares represented by the CareFusion RSUs.
No Stockholder Rights
10. .
Withholding Tax
(a) . Awardee is liable and responsible for all taxes owed in connection with the CareFusion RSUs (including taxes owed with respect to the cash payments described in paragraph 7 hereof), regardless of any action the Company or Cardinal Health takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the CareFusion RSUs. Neither the Company nor Cardinal Health makes any representation or undertaking regarding the tax treatment or the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant or vesting of the CareFusion RSUs or the subsequent sale of Shares issuable pursuant to the CareFusion RSUs. The Company does not commit and is under no obligation to structure the CareFusion RSUs to reduce or eliminate Awardee's tax liability.
Generally
(b) . Prior to any event in connection with the CareFusion RSUs (, vesting or settlement) that the Company or Cardinal Health determines may result in any domestic or foreign tax withholding obligation, whether national, federal, state or local, including any employment tax obligation (the "Tax Withholding Obligation"), Awardee is required to arrange for the satisfaction of the minimum amount of such Tax Withholding
Payment of Withholding Taxes

MPLOYEES

AND

Obligations in a manner acceptable to the Company and Cardinal Health. Unless Awardee elects to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation by an alternative means that is then permitted by the Company, by accepting the grant of Cardinal Health RSUs, Awardee has authorized the Company to withhold on Awardee's behalf the number of Shares from those Shares issuable pursuant to Awardee at the time when the CareFusion RSUs become vested and payable as the Company determines to be sufficient to satisfy the Tax Withholding Obligation. In the case of any amounts withheld for taxes pursuant to this provision in the form of Shares, the amount withheld shall not exceed the minimum required by Applicable Law and regulations. The Company shall have the right to deduct from all cash payments paid pursuant to paragraph 7 hereof the amount of any taxes which the Company is required to withhold with respect to such payments.
11. . The CareFusion RSUs are governed by the laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, except to the extent superseded by the laws of the United States of America. Awardee has acknowledged that the terms relating to Triggering Conduct, Competitor Triggering Conduct and special forfeiture and repayment rules set forth above are reasonable in nature, are fundamental for the protection of legitimate business and proprietary interests, and do not adversely affect Awardee's ability to earn a living in any capacity that does not violate such terms. In the event of any violation by Awardee of any such covenants, immediate and irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law will result. In the event of any violation or attempted violations of these restrictions and covenants, the Cardinal Group or the CareFusion Group, as the case may be, will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief or other equitable relief, including the issuance ex parte of a temporary restraining order, without any showing of irreparable harm or damage, such irreparable harm being acknowledged and admitted by Awardee, waiving any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies afforded the Cardinal Group or CareFusion Group, as the case may be, hereunder or by law. In the event that it becomes necessary for the Cardinal Group or CareFusion Group to institute legal proceedings under Awardee's CareFusion RSUs, Awardee will be responsible for all costs and reasonable legal fees with regard to such proceedings. Any term relating to the CareFusion RSUs which is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable should be construed or limited in a manner that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to the business objectives intended by such term, without invalidating or rendering unenforceable the remaining terms.
Governing Law/Venue for Dispute Resolution/Costs and Legal Fees
Awardee has agreed that the laws of the State of Ohio bear a substantial relationship to the Cardinal Health RSUs and that the benefits granted therein, and thus the CareFusion RSUs and the benefits granted thereunder, would not be granted without their governance by the laws of the State of Ohio. In addition, all legal actions or proceedings relevant to the CareFusion RSUs will be brought exclusively in state or federal courts located in Franklin County, Ohio, and Awardee has consented to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

Awardee shall be bound by the decisions of the Administrator with regard to the interpretation of these Terms and with regard to any and all matters set forth in these Terms. The Administrator may delegate its functions under these Terms to an officer of the CareFusion Group designated by the Administrator (hereinafter the "designee"). In fulfilling its responsibilities hereunder, the Administrator or its designee may rely upon documents, written statements of the parties or such other material as the Administrator or its designee deems appropriate.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contacts:
 
 Cardinal Health today announced it has completed the spinoff of CareFusion Corp. (NYSE: CFN) through a pro rata distribution of approximately 81 percent of the shares of CareFusion common stock, effectively launching it as an independent, publicly traded company.
DUBLIN, Ohio, Sept. 1, 2009
After the close of business yesterday, Cardinal Health distributed 0.5 share of CareFusion common stock for each outstanding share of Cardinal Health common stock held as of market close on Aug. 25, the record date for the distribution. Approximately 222 million shares of CareFusion common stock were outstanding as of the distribution, including certain equity awards issued in the spinoff. Approximately 180 million shares were distributed to Cardinal Health shareholders of record as of Aug. 25, and approximately 41 million shares were retained by Cardinal Health, which it will divest within five years. CareFusion common stock will begin regular way trading today on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol "CFN."
Additionally, the appointment of George S. Barrett as chairman and chief executive officer of Cardinal Health became effective upon completion of the spinoff on Aug. 31. The resignations of Philip Francis, Michael Losh and Michael O'Halleran from the Cardinal Health board of directors were also effective upon completion of the spinoff, with all three transitioning to the board of directors of CareFusion in connection with the spinoff. As previously announced, the new Cardinal Health board will consist of 10 members, including two new directors, Bruce L. Downey, effective yesterday and Glenn A. Britt, effective Oct. 1.
"The completion of the CareFusion spinoff marks a new day for Cardinal Health," Barrett said. "We are focused on our role in helping make health care more cost-effective and our commitment to improving shareholder value."
Cardinal Health is expected to benefit from enhanced management focus and sharper strategic vision, as well as improved opportunities to make investments in growth areas. In addition, the spinoff is expected to improve the alignment of management and employee incentives with performance and growth objectives at the company. The completion of the spinoff also allows Cardinal Health to adopt the capital structure, investment policy and dividend policy best suited to the financial profile and needs of the business.
