The Company shall include in such Registration all Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company receives, within the 10 days immediately following the receipt by the Holder(s) of such notice from the Company, a request for inclusion in the registration from the Holder(s) thereof. Each such request from a Holder of Registrable Securities for inclusion in the Registration shall also specify the aggregate amount of Registrable Securities proposed to be registered. For purposes of clarification, the Company can satisfy its obligation under this Section 2.1(a) to file a Registration Statement by filing a Shelf Registration Statement and can satisfy its obligation to complete a Demand Registration by filing a Prospectus under an effective Shelf Registration Statement that covers (i) the Registrable Securities requested by the Holders to be registered in accordance with this Section 2.1(a) and (ii) the plan of distribution requested by the participating Holders.

In addition, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Parent and its subsidiaries shall be permitted on a one-time basis to engage in up to three (3) related Private Debt Exchanges within any six (6)-month period during the first year following the date hereof and each Demand Registration request made by the Participating Banks in such Private Debt Exchanges pursuant to its registration rights agreement with the Company shall collectively only count as one (1) Demand Registration request for purposes of the limitation on the number of Demand Registration requests set forth in the first sentence of this Section 2.1(b) (it being understood that, Parent and its subsidiaries shall be permitted to engage in additional Private Debt Exchanges outside such 6-month period, but each Demand Registration request by the Participating Banks for such Private Debt Exchange pursuant to its registration rights agreement with the Company shall count as an additional Demand Registration request for purposes of the limitation on the number of Demand Registration requests set forth in the first sentence of this Section 2.1(b)).

The Company shall be deemed to have effected a Registration for purposes of this if the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC or becomes effective upon filing with the SEC, and remains effective until the earlier of (i) the date when all Registrable Securities thereunder have been sold and (ii) 60 days from the effective date of the Registration Statement (or from the date the applicable Prospectus is filed with the SEC if the Company is satisfying a request for Demand Registration by filing a Prospectus under an effective Shelf Registration Statement) (the ""). No Registration shall be deemed to have been effective if the conditions to closing specified in the underwriting agreement, if any, entered into in connection with such Registration are not satisfied by reason of a wrongful act, misrepresentation or breach of such applicable underwriting agreement by the Company. If during the Registration Period, such Registration is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or other governmental agency or court, the Registration Period shall be extended on a day-for-day basis for any period the Holder is unable to complete an offering as a result of such stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or other governmental agency or court.

In the case of a Registration Suspension, the Holders agree to suspend use of the applicable Prospectus in connection with any sale or purchase of, or offer to sell or purchase, Registrable Securities, upon receipt of the notice referred to above (which may be delivered orally). The Company shall (i) immediately notify the Holders upon the termination of any Registration Suspension, (ii) amend or supplement the Prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any untrue statement or omission therein, and (iii) furnish to the Holders such numbers of copies of the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented as the Holders may reasonably request.

or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any such Registration Statement (i) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such indemnified party expressly for use in the preparation thereof or (ii) which has been corrected in a subsequent filing with the SEC but such indemnified party nonetheless failed to provide such corrected filing to the Person asserting such Loss, in breach of the indemnified party's obligations under applicable law. This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Holder or any indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Holder.
(b) . Each selling Holder agrees (severally and not jointly) to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, the Company, its directors, officers, employees, advisors, and agents and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) from and against any Losses arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement under which the sale of such Registrable Securities was Registered under the Securities Act (including any final or preliminary Prospectus contained therein or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by reference therein), or any such statement made in any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities Act, or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus or free writing prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading to the extent, but, in each case (i) or (ii), only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information furnished in writing by such selling Holder to the Company specifically for inclusion in such Registration Statement, Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus or free writing prospectus and has not been corrected in a subsequent filing with the SEC provided to the Person asserting such Loss prior to or concurrently with the sale of the Registrable Securities to such Person. In no event shall the liability of any selling Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder under the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the selling Holder may otherwise have. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company or any indemnified party.
Indemnification by the Selling Holder

and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person, (iii) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, or (iv) in the reasonable judgment of any such Person, based upon advice of its counsel, a conflict of interest may exist between such Person and the indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the Person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such Person). If such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent, but such consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to settle such action without the consent of the indemnified party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. No indemnifying party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of an unconditional release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such jurisdiction at any one time from all such indemnified party or parties unless (x) the employment of more than one counsel has been authorized in writing by the indemnified party or parties, (y) an indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the other indemnified parties or (z) a conflict or potential conflict exists or may exist (based on advice of counsel to an indemnified party) between such indemnified party and the other indemnified parties, in each of which cases the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such additional counsel or counsels.
(d) . If for any reason the indemnification provided for in or is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient to hold it harmless as contemplated by or , then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. Notwithstanding anything in this to the contrary, no indemnifying party (other than the Company) shall be required pursuant to this to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such indemnifying party from the sale of Registrable Securities in the offering to which the Losses of the indemnified parties relate (before deducting expenses, if any) exceeds the amount of any damages which such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this .

Exhibit 99.1
The following pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is based on the historical financial statements of Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company"), including certain pro forma adjustments, and has been prepared to illustrate the pro forma effect of the Company's distribution of approximately 81% of the outstanding shares of CareFusion Corporation ("CareFusion") common stock to holders of Cardinal Health, Inc. common shares (the "CareFusion Separation").
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007 assume that the distribution occurred as of July 1, 2006. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2009 is presented as if the distribution had occurred as of June 30, 2009.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared based upon available information and management estimates; actual amounts may differ from these estimated amounts. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that might have occurred had the distribution occurred as of the dates stated above. The pro forma adjustments are described in the notes.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes and related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009.
 
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements give effect to the pro forma adjustments necessary to reflect the CareFusion Separation as if it occurred as of July 1, 2006 in the pro forma statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended June 2009, 2008, and 2007 and as of June 30, 2009 in the pro forma balance sheet. In accordance with SEC Regulation S-X, the pro forma statements of earnings disclose earnings from continuing operations and therefore exclude historical earnings from discontinued operations of $8.8 million, $4.6 million and $1,110.4 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of earnings and balance sheet reflect the effect of the following pro forma adjustments:

We render no opinion as to any United States federal income tax issues or other matter except as specifically set forth above. We render no opinion as to the United States federal income tax consequences of (i) the transactions under any other provisions of the Code (including Section 482); (ii) any conditions existing at the time of, or effects resulting from, the transactions that are not specifically covered above; (iii) any transactions contemplated by the Separation Agreement or described in the Private Letter Ruling other than the Distributing Contribution and the External Distribution; (iv) non-arm's length payments (if any) made in connection with the transactions; or (v) any internal restructuring that occurred or will occur in connection with the Distributing Contribution or the External Distribution or any continuing transactions between or among any of Cardinal, Cardinal's subsidiaries, CareFusion and CareFusion's subsidiaries. We render no opinion as to the tax consequences of the transactions under state, local, or foreign tax laws.
 
 
Our opinion is based on current provisions of the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, published pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service and case law, any of which may be changed at any time with retroactive effect. Any change in applicable laws or the facts and circumstances surrounding the transactions, or any inaccuracy in the statements, facts, assumptions or representations upon which we have relied, may affect the continuing validity of our opinion as set forth herein. We assume no responsibility to inform Cardinal of any such change or inaccuracy that may occur or come to our attention.
We are furnishing this opinion solely for the benefit of Cardinal. Furthermore, we are furnishing this opinion solely in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Separation Agreement, and it is not to be relied upon, used, quoted, or otherwise referred to for any other purpose or by any other party without our consent.
