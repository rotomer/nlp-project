 Cardinal Health today reported fiscal second-quarter results, with revenue increasing 3 percent to $24.9 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations
DUBLIN, Ohio, Jan. 28, 2010
1
increasing 12 percent to $0.57.
Highlights from the quarter include a 38 percent increase in profit from the Medical segment and continued improvement within the Pharmaceutical segment, with a decline in segment profit of 1 percent. The company also reported strong operating cash flow of $524 million and improvements in working capital for the quarter.
GAAP earnings from continuing operations were $230 million for the quarter, or $0.64 per share. GAAP results include a positive $0.07 per share net after-tax contribution, primarily from a previously disclosed insurance recovery and the gain on the sale of CareFusion stock, partially offset by restructuring expenses and other costs associated with the spinoff of CareFusion Corp.
"We are encouraged by our performance in the second quarter and in the first half of our fiscal year," said George Barrett, chairman and CEO of Cardinal Health. "These results reflect excellent progress on our key initiatives and customer focus across our businesses, as well as the benefit from external factors that were more pronounced than we had anticipated. Our medical segment has had particularly strong year-over-year growth, and our pharmaceutical segment continued its momentum, performing considerably better than we expected in the second quarter."

Q2 FY10 SUMMARY
 
SECOND-QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS
Pharmaceutical Segment
The Pharmaceutical segment increased revenue by 3 percent to $22.7 billion, primarily driven by increased sales to existing pharmaceutical distribution customers. Sales to non-bulk customers increased 7 percent to $11.7 billion and sales to bulk customers declined 1 percent to $11 billion. Segment profit declined 1 percent to $260 million as a result of fewer significant generic product launches versus the prior year period, the effect of customer contract repricings within the pharmaceutical distribution business and the expected impact from the Medicine Shoppe International franchisee contract transition. The decline in segment profit was partially offset by the positive margin impact from key initiatives including changes to the company's sourcing model, solid performance under its branded manufacturer agreements and disciplined cost controls.
 
Medical Segment
Revenue for the Medical segment increased 9 percent to $2.2 billion, primarily from sales growth with existing customers. Segment profit grew 38 percent to $103 million, primarily driven by the sales growth and decreased cost of raw materials associated with commodity price movements. Segment profit was partially dampened from investments associated with the Medical Transformation project.

OUTLOOK
The company also raised its EPS outlook for the year and now expects full-year fiscal 2010 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.18, up from the company's previous guidance range of $1.90 to $2.00.
"Based on our year-to-date performance and our best assessment of our current environment, our outlook for the full year has improved considerably since we last reported," Barrett said. "Although our journey is in its early stages, we are pleased with our rate of progress."

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures, including per share calculations) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations and effective tax rate from continuing operations. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast restructuring and employee severance, impairments and loss on sale of assets, litigation (credits)/charges, net, other spin-off costs and gains or losses on sale of CareFusion stock, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.

Exhibit 99.2
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), Cardinal Health, Inc.'s (the "Company's") earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's performance and provides them to investors because the measures exclude items and charges that management believes are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of the Company's products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions or, in the case of litigation credits and charges, activities that may have occurred in prior or multiple periods, in each case without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business. As discussed below, following the August 31, 2009 spin-off of CareFusion Corporation ("CareFusion") through a pro rata distribution to its shareholders of approximately 81% of the shares of CareFusion common stock ("Spin-Off"), some of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude net earnings of CareFusion included in discontinued operations and other items associated with the Spin-Off. The purpose for these adjustments is to provide for better comparability between periods by removing the impact of CareFusion on all periods. By doing so, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information regarding the historical trend of these measures as they relate to the remaining operations of the Company.
The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. Many of the charges and other items excluded in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may be recurring items and, with the exception of asset impairments, litigation gains and gain on sale of CareFusion stock, in most cases, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures should be evaluated in combination with the most comparable GAAP measures because the non-GAAP measures do not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the most comparable GAAP measures. Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental metrics to assist readers. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The Company has provided reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measures in the earnings release. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures also are included in the earnings release.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP operating earnings" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, impairments and loss on sale of assets and litigation (credits)/charges, net and Other Spin-Off Costs (defined below).
Non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation).
The Company classifies a restructuring activity as a program whereby the Company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing facilities, moving manufacturing of a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re-alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. A liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which it is incurred except for a liability for a one-time termination benefit which is recognized over its future service period.
The Company classifies certain asset impairments related to restructuring activities in restructuring and employee severance. Asset impairments and losses from the sale of assets not eligible to be classified as restructuring and employee severance or discontinued operations are classified within impairments and loss on sale of assets within the consolidated statements of earnings.
Estimated loss contingencies related to litigation and regulatory matters and income from favorable resolution of legal and regulatory matters are recognized in litigation (credits)/charges, net within the consolidated statements of earnings.
This non-GAAP measure also excludes costs incurred in connection with the Spin-Off that are not included in restructuring and employee severance, impairments and loss on sale of assets and litigation (credits)/charges, net. These costs are referred to hereinafter as "Other Spin-Off Costs."
Effective upon the Spin-Off, the Company retained 41.4 million shares of CareFusion common stock, approximately 19% of the outstanding shares. Gain on sale of CareFusion stock related to the Company's sales of approximately 5.5 million of these shares, which resulted in a gross realized gain of approximately $20 million as of the three months ended December 31, 2009.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, impairments and loss on sale of assets, litigation (credits)/charges, net, and gain on sale of CareFusion stock, each net of tax. See the discussion of these classifications above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding their components. This non-GAAP measure also excludes Other Spin-Off Costs, net of tax. Other Spin-Off Costs excluded from this non-GAAP financial measure include the $39.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt for the six months ended December 31, 2009, the $171.9 million tax expense related to the anticipated repatriation of a portion of cash loaned to the Company's entities within the United States, and $2.4 million of other costs included within other (income)/expense, net on the condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the six months ended December 31, 2009.
Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and presentations derived from it (per share and growth rate calculations).
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on equity." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, impairments and loss on sale of assets and litigation (credits)/charges, net, each net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of these classifications above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding their components. This non-GAAP financial measure also excludes Other Spin-Off Costs and gain on sale of CareFusion stock, each net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation.
Non-GAAP return on equity.
In addition to the adjustments described above, following the Spin-Off, the Company is excluding the net earnings of CareFusion included in discontinued operations from adjusted net earnings in the calculation of non-GAAP return on equity for all periods presented. Also, the Company is excluding the $3.7 billion non-cash dividend from average shareholders' equity in the calculation of non-GAAP return on equity to remove CareFusion equity for all periods presented.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on invested capital." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, impairments and loss on sale of assets and litigation (credits)/charges, net, each net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of these classifications above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding their components. This non-GAAP financial measure also excludes Other Spin-Off Costs and gain on sale of CareFusion stock, each net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation.
Non-GAAP return on invested capital.
In addition to the adjustments described above, following the Spin-Off, the Company is excluding the net earnings of CareFusion included in discontinued operations from adjusted net earnings in the calculation of non-GAAP return on invested capital for all periods presented. Also, the Company is excluding the $3.7 billion non-cash dividend from average total invested capital in the calculation of non-GAAP return on invested capital to remove CareFusion equity for all periods presented. Finally, in calculating total invested capital, unrecorded goodwill for all periods presented excludes the unrecorded goodwill associated with CareFusion.
 
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, impairments and loss on sale of assets and litigation (credits)/charges, net from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of restructuring and employee severance, impairments and loss on sale of assets and litigation (credits)/charges, net from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of these classifications above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding their components. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes Other Spin-Off Costs and gain on sale of CareFusion stock from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of Other Spin-Off Costs, including the $171.9 million tax expense described above, and gain on sale of CareFusion stock from the numerator of the calculation.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "net debt to capital," which is net debt divided by capital (net debt plus total shareholders' equity). "Net debt," also a non-GAAP financial measure, is debt (the most comparable GAAP measure, calculated as long-term obligations plus short-term borrowings) minus cash and equivalents. Management believes that net debt to capital is an important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet. With respect to net debt, cash and equivalents are subtracted from the GAAP measure because they could be used to reduce the Company's debt obligations. A limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and equivalents and therefore may imply that there is less Company debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. Management believes that investors may find it useful to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures, including per share calculations) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations and effective tax rate from continuing operations. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast restructuring and employee severance, impairments and loss on sale of assets, litigation (credits)/charges, net, other spin-off costs and gains or losses on sale of CareFusion stock, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.
