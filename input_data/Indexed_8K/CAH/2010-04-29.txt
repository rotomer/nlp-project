On April 29, 2010, Cardinal Health, Inc. ("Cardinal Health" or the "Company") issued a news release announcing its results for the quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2010. A copy of the news release is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
A discussion of the reasons why management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Cardinal Health's financial condition and results of operations is included as Exhibit 99.2 to this report.
 
During a conference call scheduled to be held at 8:30 a.m. EDT on April 29, 2010, Cardinal Health's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will discuss the Company's results for the quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2010, the Company's outlook for fiscal years ending June 30, 2010 and 2011 and the Company's business operations.

(d) Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Cardinal Health today reported fiscal third-quarter revenue of $24.3 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations
DUBLIN, Ohio, April 29, 2010
1
of $0.61.
The quarter was highlighted by a 7 percent increase in Pharmaceutical segment profit and strong operating cash flow of $879 million for the quarter.
GAAP operating earnings declined 4 percent to $366 million, or 7 percent to $385 million on a non-GAAP basis. SG&A expense was higher sequentially and year over year due to performance-based employee compensation that reflects the company's expected fiscal 2010 results.
Third-quarter GAAP earnings from continuing operations were $225 million or $0.62 per share. GAAP results include a positive $0.01 per share net after-tax contribution, primarily from the gain on the sale of CareFusion stock and partially offset by the after-tax impact from impairments and loss on the sale of assets.
"We are pleased with our third-quarter performance and our continued momentum for the year," said George Barrett, chairman and CEO of Cardinal Health. "We had strong performance from our Pharmaceutical segment, which was better than we anticipated. As expected, our Medical segment declined versus the same period last year, but grew sequentially from the prior quarter. We were particularly encouraged by the year-over-year growth in our gross margin rate, and another strong quarter of operating cash flow and working capital improvements."
Q3 FY10 SUMMARY

THIRD-QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS
Pharmaceutical Segment
Revenue for the Pharmaceutical segment increased to $22.2 billion. Sales to non-bulk customers increased 0.5 percent to $11.3 billion and sales to bulk customers increased 0.5 percent to $10.9 billion. Segment profit increased 7 percent to $307 million primarily driven by solid performance from branded manufacturer agreements, positive margin contribution from the company's generic programs and disciplined expense management. The increase in segment profit was partially offset by previously disclosed contract repricings and the Medicine Shoppe International transition. The company continues to actively manage supply disruptions of medical isotopes for its nuclear pharmacy business. These shortages are now expected to continue through at least the first quarter of next fiscal year.
In addition, the company completed the sale of its SpecialtyScripts business during the third quarter and recently entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Martindale generic injectible manufacturing business, which it expects to close before the end of the fiscal year.
 
Medical Segment
Revenue for the Medical segment increased 7 percent to $2.1 billion, primarily from sales growth with existing domestic customers and strong revenue growth from the Canadian business. As expected, segment profit declined 16 percent year over year to $108 million, primarily due to an unusual year-over-year comparison in the cost of goods sold, the aforementioned impact of performance-based employee compensation and increased investment spend associated with the Medical Business Transformation. The decline in segment profit was partially offset by the positive profit impact from revenue growth within the lab and ambulatory businesses and preferred products. Segment profit increased sequentially from the second quarter as anticipated and is expected to return to year-over-year growth for the fourth quarter.

FISCAL Q4 AND FISCAL 2011 OUTLOOK
"With the first nine months of the fiscal year behind us, we are trending slightly better than our previous expectations, and we now anticipate non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 will be in the range of $2.15 to $2.20," Barrett said.
"Although we don't typically provide annual guidance at the end of the third quarter, this has been a year of transitions for Cardinal Health, and we wanted to provide an early look at fiscal 2011. Based on the progress we've made year-to-date, our preliminary view of fiscal 2011 non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is in the range of $2.35 to $2.45. We expect to provide more specifics for fiscal 2011 when we report fourth-quarter and full-year results."

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures, including per share calculations) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations and effective tax rate from continuing operations. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast restructuring and employee severance, impairments and loss on sale of assets, litigation (credits)/charges, net, other spin-off costs and gains or losses on sale of CareFusion stock, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.

Exhibit 99.2
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), Cardinal Health, Inc.'s (the "Company's") earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's performance and provides them to investors because the measures exclude items and charges that management believes are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of the Company's products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions or, in the case of litigation credits and charges, activities that may have occurred in prior or multiple periods, in each case without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business. As discussed below, following the August 31, 2009 spin-off of CareFusion Corporation ("CareFusion") through a pro rata distribution to its shareholders of approximately 81% of the shares of CareFusion common stock (the "Spin-Off"), some of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude net earnings of CareFusion included in discontinued operations and other items associated with the Spin-Off. The purpose for these adjustments is to provide for better comparability between periods by removing the impact of CareFusion on all periods. By doing so, management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information regarding the historical trend of these measures as they relate to the remaining operations of the Company.
The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. Many of the charges and other items excluded in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may be recurring items and, with the exception of asset impairments, litigation gains and gain on sale of CareFusion stock, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures should be evaluated in combination with the most comparable GAAP measures because the non-GAAP measures do not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the comparable GAAP measures. Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental metrics to assist readers. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The Company has provided reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measures in the earnings release. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures also are included in the earnings release.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP operating earnings" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, impairments and loss on sale of assets and litigation (credits)/charges, net, and Other Spin-Off Costs included within distribution, selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A Expense").
Non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation).
The Company classifies a restructuring activity as a program whereby the Company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing facilities, moving manufacturing of a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re-alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. A liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which it is incurred except for a liability for a one-time termination benefit which is recognized over its future service period.
Asset impairments and losses from the sale of assets not eligible to be classified as discontinued operations are classified within impairments and loss on sale of assets within the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.
Estimated loss contingencies related to litigation and regulatory matters and income from favorable resolution of legal and regulatory matters are recognized in litigation (credits)/charges, net within the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, impairments and loss on sale of assets, and litigation (credits)/charges, net, each net of tax. See the discussion of these classifications above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding their components. This non-GAAP measure also excludes Other Spin-Off Costs and gain on sale of CareFusion stock, each net of tax. Other Spin-Off Costs excluded from this non-GAAP financial measure include the year-to-date loss on extinguishment of debt, the year-to-date tax expense related to the anticipated repatriation of a portion of cash loaned to the Company's entities within the United States, and other year-to-date costs included within SG&A Expense and other (income)/expense, net on the condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the nine months ended March 31, 2010. Gains and losses on sale of CareFusion stock relate to the Company's sales of a portion of the 41.4 million shares of CareFusion common stock that the Company retained in the Spin-Off.
Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and presentations derived from it (per share and growth rate calculations).
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on equity." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, impairments and loss on sale of assets and litigation (credits)/charges, net, each net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of these classifications above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding their components. This non-GAAP financial measure also excludes Other Spin-Off Costs and gain on sale of CareFusion stock, each net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation.
Non-GAAP return on equity.
In addition to the adjustments described above, following the Spin-Off, the Company is excluding the net earnings of CareFusion included in discontinued operations from adjusted net earnings in the calculation of non-GAAP return on equity for all periods presented. Also, the Company is excluding the non-cash dividend from average shareholders' equity in the calculation of non-GAAP return on equity to remove CareFusion equity for all periods presented.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, impairments and loss on sale of assets and litigation (credits)/charges, net from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of restructuring and employee severance, impairments and loss on sale of assets and litigation (credits)/charges, net from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of these classifications above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding their components. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes Other Spin-Off Costs and gain on sale of CareFusion stock from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of Other Spin-Off Costs, including the year-to-date tax expense related to the anticipated repatriation of a portion of cash loaned to the Company's entities within the United States, and gain on sale of CareFusion stock from the numerator of the calculation.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "net debt to capital," which is net debt divided by capital (net debt plus total shareholders' equity). "Net debt," also a non-GAAP financial measure, is debt (the most comparable GAAP measure, calculated as long-term obligations plus short-term borrowings) minus cash and equivalents. Management believes that net debt to capital is an important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet. With respect to net debt, cash and equivalents are subtracted from the GAAP measure because they could be used to reduce the Company's debt obligations. A limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and equivalents and therefore may imply that there is less Company debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. Management believes that investors may find it useful to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet.
Net debt to capital.

The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations and effective tax rate from continuing operations.

Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.
