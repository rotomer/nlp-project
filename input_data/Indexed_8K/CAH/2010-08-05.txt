Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 Cardinal Health today reported fiscal 2010 revenue of $98.5 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations
DUBLIN, Ohio, Aug. 5, 2010
1
of $2.22. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $24.5 billion and diluted EPS from continuing operations for the quarter was $0.54, or $0.50 on a non-GAAP basis. The company also raised its non-GAAP diluted EPS outlook for fiscal 2011 to a range of $2.38 to $2.48 from its preliminary outlook of $2.35 to $2.45.
"I am extremely proud of the progress we made in FY2010 and the actions we took to shift our growth trajectory and position us for the coming years," said George Barrett, chairman and CEO of Cardinal Health. "Our Medical segment grew profits by 11 percent for the year, while continuing to make key strategic investments. The Pharmaceutical segment declined by 3 percent, but performed considerably better than we anticipated for the full year as a result of execution on major initiatives, disciplined cost controls and some unplanned generic launches. These items largely offset the dampening effect of the actions we took to improve our strategic positioning, the negative impact from the year-over-year comparison of generic launches and the severe supply shortages in nuclear pharmacy."
Operating cash flow for fiscal 2010 increased to $2.1 billion, driven by strong working capital management.
Q4 and FY10 SUMMARY
 
 
Cardinal Health

For the quarter, GAAP results included items that had a positive $0.04 per share net after-tax contribution, primarily from a previously disclosed litigation recovery. For the full year, GAAP results included items that had an aggregate net negative effect of $0.60 per share after-tax, primarily driven by tax charges in the first-quarter related to the portion of non-U.S. earnings that will no longer be indefinitely invested offshore following the spinoff of CareFusion Corp., and restructuring and severance. These charges were partially offset by gains on the sale of CareFusion stock and litigation recoveries.
SEGMENT RESULTS
Pharmaceutical Segment
Fourth-quarter revenue for the Pharmaceutical segment was $22.3 billion, with sales to non-bulk customers increasing 3 percent to $11.5 billion and sales to bulk customers decreasing 3 percent to $10.8 billion. Generic pharmaceutical sales grew 10 percent for the quarter. Segment profit declined 17 percent to $227 million, primarily driven by lower branded inflation income, the year-over-year impact from customer pricing changes and supply disruptions in nuclear pharmacy, partially offset by the positive margin contribution from the company's generic programs and other business initiatives.
For the full year, Pharmaceutical segment revenue grew 2 percent to $89.8 billion, with sales to non-bulk customers increasing 4 percent to $45.8 billion and sales to bulk customers increasing 1 percent to $44 billion. Annual segment profit declined 3 percent to $1 billion, due to customer pricing changes, supply shortages in nuclear pharmacy, fewer significant generic launches than the prior year and the Medicine Shoppe International transition. The decline in segment profit was partially offset by contributions from the company's generic programs, disciplined cost controls and solid performance from its branded manufacturer agreements.
"We made great strides in fiscal 2010 with key strategic priorities including our generic sales and sourcing initiatives, working capital optimization and customer-facing information technology improvements  all of which are starting to have a positive impact on the bottom line," Barrett said. "With the recent renewals of key customers, we have stabilized our base for the next several years. In addition, our recent acquisition of Healthcare Solutions Holding will help accelerate our strategy for specialty pharmaceuticals and contribute to long-term growth for the segment."

Medical Segment
Fourth-quarter revenue for the Medical segment increased 3 percent to $2.2 billion, primarily from sales growth with existing customers. Segment profit increased 22 percent to $102 million, primarily driven by growth in the Hospital Supply business and disciplined cost controls, partially offset by higher commodity prices.
For the full year, Medical segment revenue increased 7 percent to $8.8 billion, driven by growth from existing customers, new products and foreign exchange. Annual segment profit increased 11 percent to $428 million, aided by the decreased cost of raw materials associated with commodity price movements. Segment profit growth was partially dampened from investment expense associated with the Medical Business Transformation program.
"While our Medical segment reported solid top- and bottom-line growth for the year, we continued to make investments to further improve our customers' experience and position the business for sustainable growth," Barrett said. "By combining our extensive channel reach with our growing expertise in category management, we will enable the growth of our preferred products and service offerings to create even more value across the entire supply chain."
 
FISCAL 2011 OUTLOOK
"We have gained additional clarity regarding key inputs to our planning process since offering our preliminary 2011 outlook in April," Barrett said. "Based on our current information, we are raising our fiscal 2011 guidance for non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations to a range of $2.38 to $2.48."

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company presents non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures, including per share calculations) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations and effective tax rate from continuing operations. The Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the Company cannot reliably forecast restructuring and employee severance, acquisition related costs, impairments and loss on sale of assets, litigation (credits)/charges, net, other spin-off costs and gains or losses on sale of CareFusion stock, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the Company's future financial results.

Exhibit 99.2
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), Cardinal Health, Inc.'s (the "Company's") earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's performance and provides them to investors because the measures exclude items and charges that management believes are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of the Company's products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions or, in the case of litigation credits and charges, activities that may have occurred in prior or multiple periods, in each case without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business. As discussed below, following the August 31, 2009 spin-off of CareFusion Corporation ("CareFusion") through a pro rata distribution to its shareholders of approximately 81% of the shares of CareFusion common stock (the "Spin-Off"), some of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude net earnings of CareFusion included in discontinued operations and other items associated with the Spin-Off. The purpose for these adjustments is to provide for better comparability between periods by removing the impact of CareFusion on all periods. By doing so, management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information regarding the historical trend of these measures as they relate to the remaining operations of the Company.
The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. Many of the charges and other items excluded in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may be recurring items and, with the exception of asset impairments, litigation gains and gain on sale of CareFusion stock, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures should be evaluated in combination with the most comparable GAAP measures because the non-GAAP measures do not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the comparable GAAP measures. Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental metrics to assist readers. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The Company has provided reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measures in the earnings release. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures also are included in the earnings release.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP operating earnings" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, acquisition related costs, impairments and loss on sale of assets and litigation (credits)/charges, net, and Other Spin-Off Costs included within distribution, selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A Expense").
Non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation).
The Company classifies a restructuring activity as a program whereby the Company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing facilities, moving manufacturing of a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re-alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. A liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which it is incurred except for a liability for a one-time termination benefit which is recognized over its future service period.
Acquisition related costs incurred during the initial evaluation of a potential targeted enterprise or incurred to combine the operations of an acquired enterprise are classified within acquisition related costs within the consolidated statements of earnings.
Asset impairments and losses from the sale of assets not eligible to be classified as discontinued operations are classified within impairments and loss on sale of assets within the consolidated statements of earnings.
Estimated loss contingencies related to litigation and regulatory matters and income from favorable resolution of legal and regulatory matters are recognized in litigation (credits)/charges, net within the consolidated statements of earnings.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, acquisition related costs, impairments and loss on sale of assets, and litigation (credits)/charges, net, each net of tax. See the discussion of these classifications above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding their components. This non-GAAP measure also excludes Other Spin-Off Costs and gain on sale of CareFusion stock, each net of tax. Other Spin-Off Costs excluded from this non-GAAP financial measure include the year-to-date loss on extinguishment of debt, the year-to-date tax expense related to the anticipated repatriation of a portion of cash loaned to the Company's entities within the United States, and other year-to-date costs included within SG&A Expense and other (income)/expense, net on the consolidated statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010. Gains and losses on sale of CareFusion stock relate to the Company's sales of a portion of the 41.4 million shares of CareFusion common stock that the Company retained in the Spin-Off.
Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and presentations derived from it (per share and growth rate calculations).
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on equity." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, acquisition related costs, impairments and loss on sale of assets and litigation (credits)/charges, net, each net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of these classifications above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding their components. This non-GAAP financial measure also excludes Other Spin-Off Costs and gain on sale of CareFusion stock, each net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation.
Non-GAAP return on equity.
In addition to the adjustments described above, following the Spin-Off, the Company is excluding the net earnings of CareFusion included in discontinued operations from adjusted net earnings in the calculation of non-GAAP return on equity for all periods presented. Also, the Company is excluding the non-cash dividend from average shareholders' equity in the calculation of non-GAAP return on equity to remove CareFusion equity for all periods presented.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, acquisition related costs, impairments and loss on sale of assets and litigation (credits)/charges, net from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of restructuring and employee severance, acquisition related costs, impairments and loss on sale of assets and litigation (credits)/charges, net from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of these classifications above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding their components. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes Other Spin-Off Costs and gain on sale of CareFusion stock from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of Other Spin-Off Costs, including the year-to-date tax expense related to the anticipated repatriation of a portion of cash loaned to the Company's entities within the United States, and gain on sale of CareFusion stock from the numerator of the calculation.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "net debt to capital," which is net debt divided by capital (net debt plus total shareholders' equity). "Net debt," also a non-GAAP financial measure, is debt (the most comparable GAAP measure, calculated as long-term obligations plus short-term borrowings) minus cash and equivalents. Management believes that net debt to capital is an
Net debt to capital.
 
important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet. With respect to net debt, cash and equivalents are subtracted from the GAAP measure because they could be used to reduce the Company's debt obligations. A limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and equivalents and therefore may imply that there is less Company debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. Management believes that investors may find it useful to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet.
