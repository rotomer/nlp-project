Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein. Unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
Resignations
3.6 . A vacancy in any office because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification, or otherwise shall be filled in the manner prescribed for regular appointments or elections to such office.
Vacancies
3.7 . Officers of the Company shall have the powers and authority conferred and the duties prescribed by law, in addition to those specified or provided for in these regulations and such other powers, authority, and duties as may be determined by the board of directors from time to time.
Powers, Authority, and Duties of Officers
4.1 . Every owner of one or more shares in the Company shall be entitled to a certificate or certificates, which shall be in such form as may be approved by the board of directors, certifying the number and class of shares in the Company owned by him. The certificates for the respective classes of such shares shall be numbered in the order in which they are issued and shall be signed in the name of the Company by the chairman or the president and the secretary; provided that, if such certificates are countersigned by a transfer agent or registrar, the signatures of such officers upon such certificates may be facsimiles, stamped, or printed. If an officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been used, stamped, or printed on any certificates ceases to be such officer because of death, resignation or other reason before such certificates are delivered by the Company, such certificates shall nevertheless be conclusively deemed to be valid if countersigned by any such transfer agent or registrar. A record shall be kept of the name of the owner or owners of the shares represented by each such certificate and the number of shares represented thereby, the date thereof, and in case of cancellation, the date of cancellation. Every certificate surrendered to the Company for exchange or transfer shall be cancelled and no new certificate or certificates shall be issued in exchange for any existing certificates until such existing certificates shall have been so cancelled, except in cases provided for in 4.4.
Certificates for Shares
4.2 . Any certificate for shares of the Company shall be transferable in person or by attorney upon the surrender of the certificate to the Company or any transfer agent for the Company (for the class of shares represented by the certificate surrendered) properly endorsed for transfer and accompanied by such assurances as the Company or its transfer agent may require as to the genuineness and effectiveness of each necessary endorsement. The person in whose name any shares stand on the books of the Company shall, to the full extent permitted by law, be conclusively deemed to be the unqualified owner and holder of the shares and entitled to exercise all rights of ownership for all purposes relating to the Company. Neither the Company nor any transfer agent of the Company shall be required to
Transfer of Shares
 
recognize any equitable interest in, or any claim to, any such shares on the part of any other person, whether disclosed on the certificate or any other way, nor shall they be required to see to the performance of any trust or other obligation.
4.3 . The board of directors may make such rules and regulations as it may deem expedient or advisable, not inconsistent with these regulations, concerning the issue, transfer, and registration of certificates for shares. It may appoint one or more transfer agents or one or more registrars, or both, and may require all certificates for shares to bear the signature of either or both.
Regulations
4.4 . A new share certificate or certificates may be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the Company which is alleged to have been lost, destroyed, or wrongfully taken upon: (a) the execution and delivery to the Company by the person claiming the certificate to have been lost, destroyed, or wrongfully taken of an affidavit of that fact in form satisfactory to the Company, specifying whether or not the certificate was endorsed at the time of such alleged loss, destruction or taking, and (b) the receipt by the Company of a surety bond, indemnity agreement, or any other assurances satisfactory to the Company and to all transfer agents and registrars of the class of shares represented by the certificate against any and all losses, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or claims to which they or any of them may be subjected by reason of the issue and delivery of such new certificate or certificates or with respect to the original certificate.
Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates
The board of directors may make reasonable rules and regulations prescribing under what conditions the books, records, accounts, and documents of the Company, or any of them, shall be open to the inspection of the shareholders. No shareholder shall be denied any right which is conferred by 1701.37, Ohio Revised Code, or any other applicable law to inspect any book, record, account, or document of the Company. An original or duplicate stock ledger showing the names and addresses of the shareholders and the number and class of shares issued or transferred of record to or by them from time to time shall at all times during the usual hours for business be open to the examination of every shareholder at the principal office or place of business of the Company in the State of Ohio.
6.1 . The Company shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, domestic or foreign, nonprofit or for profit, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other
Costs Incurred
 
enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding provided that: (a) he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company; (b) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, he or she had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; and (c) in any action or suit by or in the right of the Company, no indemnification shall be made with respect to any amounts paid in settlement or with respect to any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his or her duty to the Company unless and only to the extent that the Court of Common Pleas or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the Court of Common Pleas or such other court shall deem proper. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not of itself create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that he or she had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
6.2 . Any indemnification under 6.1 shall be made by the Company only if and as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in 6.1. Such determination shall be made by one of the following methods: (a) by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors of the Company who were not and are not parties to or threatened with any such action, suit, or proceeding; or (b) if such a quorum is not obtainable or if a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, in a written opinion by independent legal counsel retained by the Company, other than an attorney, or a firm having associated with it an attorney, who has been retained by or who has performed services for the Company or any person to be indemnified within the past five years; or (c) by the shareholders; or (d) by the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, Ohio, or the court in which such action, suit, or proceeding was brought.
Indemnification Procedure
6.3 . Expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in defending any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in 6.1 may be paid by the Company in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit, or proceeding as authorized by the directors in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Company as authorized in this Article.
Advance Payment of Costs
6.4 . The indemnification authorized in this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which persons seeking indemnification may be entitled under any agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.
Non-Exclusive
 
 
6.5 . The Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, domestic or foreign, nonprofit or for profit, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under this Article or under Chapter 1701, Ohio Revised Code.
Insurance
6.6 . The indemnification authorized in this Article shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent.
Survival
6.7 . The indemnification authorized in this Article shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of any person entitled to indemnification under this Article.
Successors
The board of directors may adopt and alter a corporate seal and use the same or a facsimile thereof, but failure to affix the corporate seal, if any, shall not affect the validity of any instrument.
 
 
The fiscal year of the Company shall be fixed and may be changed from time to time by the board of directors.
Section 1701.831, Ohio Revised Code, shall not apply to control share acquisitions of shares of the Company.
These regulations may be amended or repealed or new regulations may be adopted: (a) at any meeting of the shareholders held for such purpose by the affirmative vote of the holders of record of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power on such proposal; (b) without a meeting of the shareholders, by the written consent of the holders of record of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting power on such proposal; or (c) by the board of directors (to the extent permitted by the Ohio Revised Code).
