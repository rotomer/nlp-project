Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cardinal Health today reported a 7 percent increase in fiscal 2012 second-quarter revenue to $27.1 billion and a 21 percent increase in non-GAAP operating earnings to $475 million. The company also reported an 11 percent increase in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations to $0.81. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 25 percent to $0.76.
DUBLIN, Ohio, Feb. 2, 2012 
"We're pleased at the strong results of our second quarter and the first half of our fiscal 2012" said George Barrett, chairman and chief executive officer of Cardinal Health. "Both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments delivered strong revenue growth in the second quarter, and key areas of strategic focus performed very well. Robust 30 percent profit growth in the Pharmaceutical segment versus the prior year more than offset the anticipated impact of residual commodity cost pressures on Medical segment profit.
"Based on our performance in the first half of fiscal 2012 and our perspective on trends for the second half of the year, we are revising our fiscal 2012 guidance for non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations to a range of $3.10 to $3.20."
The company's previous range for full-year guidance was $3.04 to $3.19.
Q2 FY12 SUMMARY
 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the prior-year quarter benefited from a lower-than-usual tax rate.
SEGMENT RESULTS
Pharmaceutical segment
Revenue for the Pharmaceutical segment increased 6 percent to $24.7 billion, driven by acquisitions and increased volume from existing and new customers. Segment profit increased 30 percent to $394 million, driven by strong results from generic programs, including the impact of new item launches, as well as performance under manufacturer agreements and significant contributions from acquisitions completed in fiscal 2011.
 
Medical segment
Revenue for the Medical segment increased 9 percent to $2.4 billion, driven by solid volume growth from existing and net new customers and strong preferred products volume. As expected, segment profit declined 18 percent to $85 million, as commodity price pressure and increased investments in information systems were partially offset by the favorable profit impact from growth in the company's preferred products program.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We present non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations (and presentations derived from these financial measures, including per share calculations) on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures are earnings from continuing operations and effective tax rate from continuing operations. We are unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because we cannot reliably forecast restructuring and employee severance, acquisition-related costs (including amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets), impairments and loss on sale of assets, litigation (recoveries)/charges, net, and other spin-off costs, which are difficult to predict and estimate and are primarily dependent on future events. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact our future financial results.

Exhibit 99.2
In addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), Cardinal Health, Inc.'s (the "Company's") earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's performance and provides them to investors because the measures exclude items and charges that management believes are not reflective of the day-to-day offering of the Company's products and services and relate more to strategic, multi-year corporate actions or, in the case of litigation (recoveries)/charges, activities that may have occurred in prior or multiple periods, in each case without predictable trends, that may obscure the trends and financial performance of the Company's core business. As a result of the August 31, 2009 spin-off (the "Spin-Off") of CareFusion Corporation ("CareFusion"), some of these non-GAAP financial measures exclude net earnings of CareFusion included in discontinued operations and other items associated with the Spin-Off. The purpose for these adjustments is to provide for better comparability between periods by removing the impact of CareFusion on all periods. By doing so, management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information regarding the historical trend of these measures as they relate to the remaining operations of the Company.
The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. Many of the charges and other items excluded in the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may be recurring items and, with the exception of asset impairments, litigation gains and gain on sale of CareFusion stock, the excluded items include transactions that reflect cash costs to the Company. Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures should be evaluated in combination with the most comparable GAAP measures because the non-GAAP measures do not reflect items that impact current period operating results and may be higher than the comparable GAAP measures. Management encourages readers to rely upon the GAAP numbers, but includes the non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental metrics to assist readers. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The Company has provided reconciliations of the "non-GAAP" financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the earnings release. Definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures also are included in the earnings release.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP operating earnings" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, acquisition-related costs, impairments and loss on sale of assets, litigation (recoveries)/charges, net, and Other Spin-Off Costs included within distribution, selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A Expense").
Non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation).
The Company considers restructuring activities to be programs whereby the Company fundamentally changes its operations such as closing and consolidating certain manufacturing and distribution facilities, moving manufacturing of a product to another location, outsourcing the production of a product, rationalizing headcount, and realigning operations. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial realignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. A liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which it is incurred except for a liability for a one-time termination benefit, which is recognized over its future service period.
The Company classifies costs incurred in connection with acquisitions as acquisition-related costs in its condensed consolidated statement of earnings. The costs consist primarily of transaction costs, integration costs, changes in the fair value of contingent payments and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Transaction costs are incurred during the initial evaluation of a potential targeted acquisition and primarily relate to costs to analyze, negotiate and consummate the transactions as well as due diligence activities. Integration costs relate to activities needed to combine the operations of an acquired enterprise into the Company's operations. The Company records changes in the fair value of contingent payments relating to acquisitions as income or expense in our acquisition-related costs.
Asset impairments and losses from the sale of assets not eligible to be classified as discontinued operations are classified within impairments and loss on sale of assets within the consolidated statements of earnings.
Estimated loss contingencies related to litigation and regulatory matters and income from favorable resolution of litigation are recognized in litigation (recoveries)/charges, net within the consolidated statements of earnings.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations" and presentations derived from this measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, acquisition-related costs, impairments and loss on sale of assets and litigation (recoveries)/charges, net, each net of tax. See the discussion of these classifications above under the heading "non-GAAP operating earnings and presentations derived from it (growth rate calculation)" for information regarding their components. This non-GAAP measure also excludes Other Spin-Off Costs and gain on sale of CareFusion stock, each net of tax. Other Spin-Off Costs are costs incurred in connection with the Spin-Off that are included within SG&A Expense on the consolidated statement of earnings. Gains on sale of CareFusion stock relate to the Company's sales of the shares of CareFusion common stock that the Company retained in the Spin-Off.
Non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and presentations derived from it (per share and growth rate calculations).
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP return on equity." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, acquisition-related costs, impairments and loss on sale of assets, litigation (recoveries)/charges, net, Other Spin-Off Costs and gain on sale of CareFusion stock each net of tax, from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of these classifications above for information regarding their components.
Non-GAAP return on equity.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations." This non-GAAP financial measure excludes restructuring and employee severance, acquisition-related costs, impairments and loss on sale of assets, litigation (recoveries)/charges, net, Other Spin-Off Costs and gain on sale of CareFusion stock from the denominator of the calculation and the tax effect of restructuring and employee severance, acquisition-related costs, impairments and loss on sale of asset, litigation (recoveries)/charges, net, Other Spin-Off Costs and gain on sale of CareFusion stock from the numerator of the calculation. See the discussion of these classifications above for information regarding their components.
Non-GAAP effective tax rate from continuing operations.
The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure "net debt to capital," which is net debt divided by capital (net debt plus total shareholders' equity). "Net debt," also a non-GAAP financial measure, is debt (the most comparable GAAP measure, calculated as long-term obligations plus short-term borrowings) minus cash and equivalents. Management believes that net debt to capital is an important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet. With respect to net debt, cash and equivalents are subtracted from the GAAP measure because they could be used to reduce the Company's debt obligations. A limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and equivalents and therefore may imply that there is less Company debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. Management believes that investors may find it useful to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet.
