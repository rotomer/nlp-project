Item 5.04.    Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans.
On August 31, 2012, a notification was made regarding a blackout period with respect to the Cardinal Health 401(k) Savings Plan pursuant to Section 101(i)(2)(E) of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. On September 4, 2012, pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 104 of Regulation BTR under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), Cardinal Health, Inc. (the "Company") sent a notice (the "Prior Notice") of the blackout period to its directors and executive officers, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 6, 2012. The Prior Notice indicated that the blackout period was required due to the transition to a new plan administrator and would begin at 4:00 pm Eastern Time on October 5, 2012 and end during the week of October 28, 2012 (such period, the Blackout Period).
On October 26, 2012, pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 104 of Regulation BTR under the Exchange Act, the Company sent an updated notice (the "Updated Notice") to its directors and executive officers informing them that because the change in plan administrator and the related data transfers were completed earlier than anticipated, the blackout period ended on October 25, 2012. A copy of the Updated Notice is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1
Important Update on Blackout Period to Directors and Executive Officers of Cardinal Health, Inc.
October 26, 2012
This is an update to the notice we sent to you on September 4, 2012. As you may recall, we sent that notice because federal securities laws require us to send you a notice whenever restrictions are imposed on your trading in our common shares (including derivatives) due to a blackout of the Cardinal Health 401(k) Savings Plan (the 401(k) plan) that lasts for a period of more than three consecutive business days. The 401(k) plan is changing plan administrators from Fidelity Investments to Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust, and as a result, there has been a blackout period (the "Blackout Period") during which 401(k) plan participants have been temporarily unable to make contribution rate and future investment changes, investment election changes, loan repayments or requests and withdrawals/distributions under the 401(k) plan.
The Blackout Period was expected to end during the week of October 28, 2012.
Because the change in plan administrator and the related data transfers were completed earlier than anticipated, the Blackout Period ended on October 25, 2012.
