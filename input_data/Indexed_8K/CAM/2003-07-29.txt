Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits. The following is being furnished as an exhibit to this report. Exhibit 99.1 Press Release of Cooper Cameron Corporation, dated July 30, 2003 - Cooper Cameron Second Quarter Earnings Per Share $0.37 Item 12. Disclosure of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On July 30, 2003, Cooper Cameron Corporation issued a press release announcing its results of the second quarter ended June 30, 2003. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference into this item. Exhibit 99.1 to this report contains certain "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The non-GAAP financial measures include earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense and plant closing, business realignment and certain other costs ("EBITDA") and earnings per share, excluding plant closing, business realignment and certain other costs. A reconciliation of these items to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP") is included as an attachment to the press release. The Company believes the presentation of EBITDA is useful to the Company's investors because EBITDA is an appropriate measure of evaluating the Company's operating performance and liquidity that reflects the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the business, strengthening the balance sheet, repurchasing the Company's securities and making strategic acquisitions. In addition, EBITDA is a widely used benchmark in the investment community, and the Company also uses EBITDA as a performance measure in its corporate bonus program. The Company excludes plant closing, business realignment and certain other costs from EBITDA and earnings per share since the Company believes these non-GAAP operating performance measures are useful for investors because they enhance investors' ability to analyze trends in the Company's underlying business and to compare the Company's operating performance to that of the Company's peers. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Description - ------ ----------- 99.1 Cooper Cameron Corporation's press release dated July 30, 2003

Exhibit 99.1 Cooper Cameron Second Quarter Earnings Per Share $0.37 - Earnings per share total $0.37 versus $0.40 a year ago - Earnings show sequential increase over first quarter 2003 - Backlog reaches record level at nearly $1 billion HOUSTON, July 30 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Cooper Cameron Corporation (NYSE: CAM) reported net income of $20.8 million, or $0.37 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. This compares with net income of $22.7 million, or $0.40 per share, for the second quarter of 2002. Total revenues were $400.9 million for the quarter, down slightly from 2002's $402.6 million, due primarily to a decline in Cooper Compression's revenues. Income before income taxes was $28.1 million, down from 2002's $31.9 million. Consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $49.5 million, down from 2002's $52.0 million, and EBITDA as a percent of revenues was 12.4 percent for the quarter, compared with 12.9 percent in the second quarter of 2002. Cooper Cameron Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Sheldon R. Erikson said that the decline in earnings from a year ago is a result of lower EBITDA margins in Cooper Cameron Valves' (CCV) business, partially offset by modest increases in EBITDA at both Cameron and Cooper Compression. Mild recovery in compression business drives sequential improvement Erikson noted that sequential increases in Cooper Compression's revenues and profits, resulting from increased orders from Cooper Compression's pipeline customers and reductions in operating costs, were the primary drivers behind the Company's improved results compared to the first quarter. Cameron also posted a sequential profit improvement on increased revenues, while CCV's earnings were down modestly on a slight increase in revenues. Cameron sees second-half deliveries contributing strongly to earnings "Cameron's sequential improvement in revenues and profits reflects the ramping up of subsea shipments and general strengthening in the North American gas markets," Erikson said, "although we have not yet seen a significant impact on Cameron's revenues as a result of the increase in the rig count during the first half of the year." Erikson also noted that he expects Cameron's revenues and EBITDA to increase during the second half of 2003 on the strength of increasing equipment deliveries for several large subsea projects. CCV margins down from prior year CCV's EBITDA margins were lower than year-ago levels due primarily to a decline in higher-margin pipeline-related revenues. Erikson noted, however, that CCV's first-half 2003 orders are up nearly 28 percent from year-ago levels, and that he expects CCV's revenues to be higher in the second half as a result of an increased backlog and continuing improvement in the domestic rig count. Cooper Compression revenues, margins rebound from first quarter lows Cooper Compression's revenues and EBITDA margins were significantly higher in the second quarter than in the first, and EBITDA margins were higher than year-ago levels despite a slight decline in revenues compared with the second quarter of 2002. Erikson said he expects Cooper Compression's results to improve further through year-end. "While certain of our gas compression customers continue to deal with financial difficulties," he said, "we have seen an encouraging uptick in new Ajax units and parts orders during the first half." Earnings expectations reflect increase in subsea deliveries Erikson said that Cooper Cameron's third quarter earnings per share are expected to increase to approximately $0.50 to $0.55, primarily due to revenues and earnings associated with Cameron's deliveries of subsea equipment, and full-year earnings are expected to be approximately $1.80 to $1.90 per share, excluding plant closing, business realignment and other costs of approximately $0.07 per share, which were recorded in the Company's first quarter 2003 results. "We expect Cameron to post steady sequential improvement during the second half of the year; CCV to generate slightly higher earnings in the second half of the year; and Cooper Compression to show a moderate increase in profitability during the fourth quarter," he said. Financial condition remains solid Cooper Cameron's total debt, net of cash and short-term investments, at June 30, 2003 was $114.3 million, down from $168.8 million at December 31, 2002, and the Company's net debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 9.4 percent. Erikson noted that the Company generated approximately $39 million of cash from operating activities during the quarter and $78 million for the first six months, and that capital spending through the first half of the year totaled approximately $29 million. Orders increase from year-ago levels in all three divisions; backlog reaches record Orders received during the second quarter of 2003 totaled $409 million, up 17 percent from year-ago levels, and year-to-date orders were $923 million, up more than 30 percent from the first half of 2002. Erikson noted that there was a sequential decline from the first quarter, reflecting the booking of a significant subsea project order early in the year. "While Cameron's orders were off from the strong level recorded in the first quarter and CCV's and Cooper Compression's were essentially flat with the prior quarter," Erikson said, "first-half 2003 orders are above the first half of 2002 for all three divisions. Further, total orders for the quarter modestly exceeded revenues, allowing us to post another increase in backlog." At June 30, 2003, total backlog was $989 million, up 2.5 percent from the prior quarter's $965 million, and significantly above the June 30, 2002 level of $637 million. Erikson noted that Cameron's ending backlog of $821 million is now the highest in its history.

The Company's actual results may differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on current expectations of the Company's performance and are subject to a variety of factors that can affect the Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. Such factors may include overall demand for, and pricing of, the Company's products; the size and timing of orders; the Company's ability to successfully execute the large subsea projects it has been awarded; changes in the price of (and demand for) oil and gas in both domestic and international markets; political and social issues affecting the countries in which the Company does business; fluctuations in currency markets worldwide; fluctuations in debt and equity markets; and variations in global economic activity. In particular, current and projected oil and gas prices historically have directly affected customers' spending levels and their related purchases of the Company's products and services, though they have not done so recently. Additionally, changes in oil and gas price expectations may impact the Company's financial results due to changes in cost structure, staffing or spending levels. Because the information herein is based solely on data currently available, it is subject to change as a result of changes in conditions over which the Company has no control or influence, and should not therefore be viewed as assurance regarding the Company's future performance. Additionally, the Company is not obligated to make public indication of such changes unless required under applicable disclosure rules and regulations.
