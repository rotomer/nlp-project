Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
Cooper Cameron Corporation (the "Company") has reached agreement with those executive officers with a Change of Control Agreement containing the right, in the event of a change of control, to tender to the Company their options in exchange for an amount equal to the Black-Scholes value of such options (the "B/S Put Right") to cancel this right. As consideration for this cancellation, the Company agreed to the payment of an agreed sum and a modification of the definition of "change of control" in the agreement to include mergers and other significant transactions involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a result of which at least 30% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company or an equivalent value of cash or cash and securities is transferred, and a termination of the officer occurs in connection therewith. As a result, there is no longer any agreement containing a B/S Put Right.
