Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On April 27, 2006, Cooper Cameron Corporation issued a press release announcing its results of the first quarter ended March 31, 2006. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference into this item.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
Exhibit 99.1 to this report contains a "non-GAAP financial measure" as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The non-GAAP financial measure reflects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense ("EBITDA"). A reconciliation of EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States ("GAAP") is included as an attachment to the press release. The Company believes the presentation of EBITDA is useful to the Company's investors because EBITDA is an appropriate measure of evaluating the Company's operating performance and liquidity that reflects the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the business, strengthening the balance sheet, repurchasing the Company's securities and making strategic acquisitions. In addition, EBITDA is a widely used benchmark in the investment community.
The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

COOPER CAMERON FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE $0.47 VS. $0.26 LAST YEAR
HOUSTON (April 27, 2006)  Cooper Cameron Corporation (NYSE: CAM) reported net income of $56.0 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, compared with net income of $28.6 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2005. (Per share data for the prior period has been revised to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split effective December 15, 2005.) The first quarter 2006 results include after-tax charges of approximately $6.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, related to the integration of the Dresser acquisition.
Revenues up more than 50 percent from year ago, income before taxes more than doubles
     Revenues were $829.7 million for the quarter, up 51 percent from 2005's $547.9 million, and income before income taxes was $86.2 million, up nearly 105 percent from $42.1 million a year ago. Cooper Cameron Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Sheldon R. Erikson noted that the year-over-year increase in revenues reflects continuing strength across the Company's markets and the first full quarter's contribution from the Dresser acquisition. The overall market strength was the primary driver of the increase in income before income taxes in the quarter.
Orders outpace revenues, backlog reaches another new record
     All three of the Company's business segments posted year-over-year and sequential increases in orders during the first quarter of 2006. Total orders were $1.34 billion, nearly
 
double the $680 million of a year ago. "Cameron recorded the highest single-quarter orders in its history as a result of record bookings of drilling equipment, driven by deepwater rig construction; Cooper Cameron Valves' (CCV) record bookings reflect the addition of the Dresser businesses and continuing strength across its markets; and Compression's orders reached their highest quarterly level since 1999," Erikson said.
     The record orders generated another increase in the Company's backlog. The $2.69 billion total at March 31, 2006 was 25 percent higher than the year-end 2005 level of $2.16 billion, and was up nearly 140 percent from the $1.13 billion of a year ago.
Quarter's operating cash flow reflects working capital needs
     Erikson said that the Company's cash flow from operations was approximately $3.6 million during the first quarter. "The pace of orders and the increased level of manufacturing activity have resulted in an increase in working capital needs, primarily inventory," he noted. "As a result, the current quarter's operating cash flow is down significantly from recent levels." Erikson said the increased working capital requirements are not unusual given the current activity levels and order inflow, and that he fully expects the Company to internally fund its cash needs for the year, including any acquisitions or stock repurchases that may be undertaken.
Dresser integration remains on schedule, drives CCV revenue gains
     "The integration into CCV of the businesses acquired from Dresser remains on schedule," Erikson said. "The first quarter orders and revenues reflect the first full quarter of their inclusion in CCV's results, and we are pleased with the contribution to earnings from these operations in the midst of the integration process." He noted that while CCV's margins are not as high as the pre-acquisition levels due to certain lower-margin backlog in the acquired businesses, CCV's performance is, nonetheless, better than originally expected. With regard to the ongoing integration, Erikson said "We anticipate the remaining charges associated with the integration process during 2006 will be approximately $34.5 million ($22.4 million after-tax, or $0.18 per share), of which approximately $27.5 million will be cash. There will likely be some modest level of charges recognized in 2007, but the vast majority of the integration will be complete by year-end 2006." He noted that CCV's margins should continue to improve in future quarters as lower-margin backlog is delivered and as anticipated cost savings associated with the acquisition are realized.
Balance sheet healthy, acquisitions and share buybacks remain options
     Cooper Cameron's total debt, net of cash and short-term investments, at March 31, 2006 was $166.1 million, up from $88.9 million at December 31, 2005, and the Company's net debt-to-capitalization ratio increased to approximately 9.1 percent. Erikson noted that the Company
 
repurchased 723,700 shares of its common stock during the quarter at an average price of approximately $41.11 per share, and continues to evaluate both acquisition opportunities and share repurchases as uses of cash.
Full-year earnings guidance raised
     Erikson said that second quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.45 per share, including charges of approximately $0.11 per share related to the ongoing integration of the Dresser acquisition. He also said the Company now expects earnings per share for 2006 to be in the $2.05 to $2.15 range, up from the earlier guidance of $1.70 to $1.80. The updated full-year guidance includes charges of approximately $0.23 per share (including $0.05 in the first quarter) related to the Dresser integration, while the prior guidance included charges of approximately $0.30 per share. Erikson noted that the reduction in the expected integration charges from the earlier guidance primarily reflects lower-than-expected costs associated with downsizing certain CCV facilities.

     In addition to the historical data contained herein, this document includes forward-looking statements regarding future market strength, order levels, revenues and earnings of the Company (including second quarter and full year 2006 earnings per share estimates), as well as expectations regarding margins, profitability, cash flow and costs associated with the restructuring and consolidation of the Dresser acquisition, made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company's actual results may differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on current expectations of the Company's performance and are subject to a variety of factors, some of which are not under the control of the Company, which can affect the Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. Such factors may include overall demand for, and pricing of, the Company's products; the size and timing of orders; the Company's ability to successfully execute the large subsea systems projects it has been awarded; the Company's ability to convert backlog into revenues on a timely and profitable basis; the impact of acquisitions the Company has made or may make; changes in the price of (and demand for) oil and gas in both domestic and international markets; raw material costs and availability; political and social issues affecting the countries in which the Company does business; fluctuations in currency markets worldwide; and variations in global economic activity. In particular, current and projected oil and gas prices historically have generally directly affected
 
customers' spending levels and their related purchases of the Company's products and services. Additionally, changes in oil and gas price expectations may impact the Company's financial results due to changes in cost structure, staffing or spending levels.
     Because the information herein is based solely on data currently available, it is subject to change as a result of changes in conditions over which the Company has no control or influence, and should not therefore be viewed as assurance regarding the Company's future performance.
