Financial Statements and Exhibits
(c) Exhibits:
The following are being furnished as exhibits to this report:
 
Exhibit 99.1 to this report contains non-GAAP financial measures  as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The non-GAAP financial measures reflect earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense (EBITDA). A reconciliation of EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (GAAP) is included as an attachment to the press release. The Company believes the presentation of EBITDA is useful to the Companys investors because EBITDA is an appropriate measure of evaluating the Companys operating performance and liquidity that reflects the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the business, strengthening the balance sheet, repurchasing the Companys securities and making strategic acquisitions. In addition, EBITDA is a widely used benchmark in the investment community.
 
The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

CAMERON THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE $1.31; INCLUDES $0.17 PER SHARE GAIN ON RESOLUTION OF TAX MATTERS
HOUSTON (November 1, 2007) -- Cameron (NYSE: CAM) reported net income of $150.7 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, compared with net income of $89.3 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2006.  The third quarter 2007 results included reductions in income tax expense of $19.8 million, or $0.17 per share, relating primarily to the favorable resolution of certain income tax uncertainties that were reserved for in prior periods.  The third quarter 2006 results included after-tax charges of approximately $2.3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, related to the integration of the Dresser acquisition.  Excluding the items noted above, the Companys earnings were $1.14 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2007 and $0.80 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2006.
Total revenues were $1,186.2 million for the quarter, up 21 percent from 2006s $978.8 million, while income before income taxes was $198.9 million, up nearly 42 percent from the $140.5 million of a year ago.  Cameron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sheldon R. Erikson noted that shipments of drilling equipment for new rig construction projects, and continued strength and improved margins in Valves & Measurement (V&M) and the reciprocating compression business drove the increase in the Companys year-over-year financial performance.
 
Orders increase modestly for quarter, year-to-date; backlog at new high
 
Orders received during the third quarter of 2007 totaled $1,329.0 million, up five percent from the $1,263.4 million of a year ago.  One of Camerons strengthsthe diversity of our product offeringsallowed us to again post an increase in year-over-year orders, Erikson said.  He noted that, as expected, drilling equipment orders declined from year-ago levels, but several of Camerons other businesses recorded meaningful year-over-year increases.  Surface and subsea orders in Drilling & Production Systems (DPS) showed gains, as did both engineered and process valves in V&M, Erikson said, and Compression Systems orders were up nearly 50 percent from a year ago.  Erikson said Camerons total orders exceeded revenues for the twelfth consecutive quarter, and he noted that the Companys total orders for the first nine months of the year, at $3.89 billion, were ahead of 2006s $3.86 billion for the same period.
At September 30, 2007, the Companys backlog totaled $4.13 billion, up nearly four percent from the $3.98 billion level at the end of the second quarter, and up 22 percent from the year-ago level of $3.39 billion.
 
Cash flow generation supports capital spending, share repurchases; balance sheet solid
 
     Erikson said that Camerons cash flow from operations totaled $167.6 million through the first nine months of 2007, compared with $210.2 million for the same period of 2006.  Year-to-date capital expenditures totaled $161.2 million, as compared to $108.9 million for the 2006 period, and our current estimate for full-year spending is about $235 to $240 million, he noted.  We have essentially completed our new subsea facility in Malaysia, and we will spend approximately $5 million this year on the initial phase of construction of our new Romanian plant, which will be completed by late 2008 and will cost approximately $63 million.  Erikson also said that Cameron has repurchased more than 4.7 million shares of its common stock during 2007 at a cost of approximately $282.1 million, including 61,500 shares during the third quarter at an average price of $76.62 per share.
   
At September 30, 2007, Camerons total debt, net of cash and short-term investments, was $184.6 million, down from $287.4 million at June 30, 2007, and the Companys net debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 8.5 percent.
 
Full-year earnings per share expected to be $4.24 to $4.27; estimate of pension charge reduced
 
We currently expect Camerons full-year earnings for 2007 to be approximately $4.24 to $4.27 per share, including $0.23 per share of tax gains reported in the second and third quarters and a non-cash charge of approximately $0.20 per share associated with the previously announced termination of the Companys U.S. pension plans, Erikson said. He noted that the above figures will be adjusted when the Company reports year-end results to reflect the previously announced 2-for-1 stock split, expected to be effected following stockholder approval in December.
Erikson said the Company currently expects to record a total of approximately $67 million in non-cash, pre-tax charges between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2009 related to the pension plan termination, down from the earlier estimate of approximately $85 million.  The lower current estimate reflects the recent performance of the pension plan investments and a reduction in the expected costs of the plan termination, Erikson said. He noted that the Company still expects the process to require that an additional $10 million to $15 million be funded to the plans in the latter part of 2008 or early 2009.
Erikson also said that he expects Camerons earnings and cash flow to increase once again in 2008, and that the Company plans to provide a forecast of results for the first quarter and full-year 2008 shortly after the first of the year.
Cameron (NYSE: CAM) is a leading provider of flow equipment products, systems and services to worldwide oil, gas and process industries.

In addition to the historical data contained herein, this document includes forward-looking statements regarding future market strength, order levels, revenues and earnings of the Company (including fourth quarter and full year 2007 earnings per share estimates and 2008 expectations), as well as expectations regarding margins, profitability, capacity, cash flow, full-year capital spending, capital spending in 2007 and 2008 for construction of a new facility in Romania, the 2-for-1 stock split and the estimated cost and cash funding requirements related to terminating the U. S. pension plans, made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  The Companys actual results may differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements.  Such statements are based on current expectations of the Companys performance and are subject to a variety of factors, some of which are not under the control of the Company, which can affect the Companys results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.  Such factors may include overall demand for, and pricing of, the Companys products; the size and timing of orders; the Companys ability to successfully execute the large subsea systems and drilling projects it has been awarded; the Companys ability to convert backlog into revenues on a timely and profitable basis; the Companys ability to successfully implement its capital expenditures program; the impact of acquisitions the Company has made or may make; changes in the price of (and demand for) oil and gas in both domestic and international markets; raw material costs and availability; political and social issues affecting the countries in which the Company does business; fluctuations in currency markets worldwide; and variations in global economic activity.  In particular, current and projected oil and gas prices historically have generally directly affected customers spending levels and their related purchases of the Companys products and services.  Additionally, changes in oil and gas price expectations may impact the Companys financial results due to changes in cost structure, staffing or spending levels.
Because the information herein is based solely on data currently available, it is subject to change as a result of changes in conditions over which the Company has no control or influence, and should not therefore be viewed as assurance regarding the Companys future performance.  Additionally, the Company is not obligated to make public indication of such changes unless required under applicable disclosure rules and regulations.
