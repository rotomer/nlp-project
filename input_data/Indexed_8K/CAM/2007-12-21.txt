Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Effective December 21, 2007, Michael McShane has resigned as a director of Cameron International Corporation (the "Company") due to the fact that Grant Prideco, Inc., for whom he serves as chairman, president and chief executive officer, has agreed to be acquired by National Oilwell Varco ("NOV"), a competitor of the Company. As a result of this acquisition, Mr. McShane will be a stockholder and employee of NOV, which he believes would create possible conflicts with his duties as a director of the Company.
