Item 8.01 Other Events.
On December 27, 2007, Sheldon R. Erikson, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan ("Plan") with a broker, effective January 1, 2008. The Plan specifies the timing and market prices for the sales, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. Mr. Erikson entered into the Plan as part of his personal long-term investment strategy for asset management and liquidity. Mr. Erikson will have no control over the stock sales under the Plan. The Plan is scheduled to terminate on December 31, 2008. The Plan is intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Company's insider trading policy. Rule 10b5-1 allows corporate insiders to establish prearranged written stock trading plans. A 10b5-1 plan must be entered into in good faith at a time when an insider is not aware of material non-public information. Subsequent receipt by an insider of material non-public information will not prevent prearranged transactions under a 10b5-1 plan from being executed.
