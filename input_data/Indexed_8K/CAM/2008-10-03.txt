On September 29, 2008, Cameron International Corporation (the Company) entered into a Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan (Plan) with Lazard Capital Markets LLC, effective October  1, 2008, under which Lazard will repurchase up to 750,000 shares on behalf of the Company as part of the Companys previously announced stock repurchase program.  The shares will be purchased by Lazard during the period between October 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008.  The Plan specifies the timing and market prices of the sales, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, and is intended to comply with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Depending upon prevailing market conditions and other factors, there can be no assurance that all authorized shares will be purchased pursuant to the plan. To date, Lazard has purchased 125,000 shares under the Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan.  The Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Company to repurchase its shares during periods when it would normally not be active in the market due to its internal trading blackout period. 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
Date:
