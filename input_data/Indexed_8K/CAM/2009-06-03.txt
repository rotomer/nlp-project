Merger Agreement
Merger
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of NATCO common stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, will be exchanged for 1.185 shares of Cameron common stock (the ).  In connection with the Merger, each share of NATCO restricted stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will become fully vested (except for a limited number of permitted grants between signing and closing which will not automatically vest) and will be converted into Cameron common stock at the Exchange Ratio.  Further, upon consummation of the Merger, all outstanding NATCO stock options will fully vest (except for a limited number of permitted grants between signing and closing which will not automatically vest) and will be assumed by Cameron but will represent the right to acquire Cameron common stock, with corresponding adjustments to the number of shares and exercise price based on the Exchange Ratio.  Based upon the current capitalization of Cameron and NATCO, the stockholders of NATCO will own approximately 10% of the combined company upon consummation of the Merger.
Exchange Ratio
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by each of the parties.  Completion of the Merger is conditioned upon, among other things: (1) approval of the Merger Agreement by NATCOs stockholders, (2) applicable regulatory approvals, including, the termination or expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (3) the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 that will be filed by Cameron for the issuance of its common stock in the Merger and the approval of the listing of these shares on the New York Stock Exchange, (4) the absence of legal impediments prohibiting the Merger and any related transaction, (5) the absence of any material adverse effect with respect to Camerons or NATCOs business, as applicable and (6) delivery of tax opinions by each of Camerons and NATCOs counsel.
Investors are cautioned that the representations, warranties and covenants included the Merger Agreement were made by Cameron and NATCO to each other.  These representations, warranties and covenants were made as of specific dates and only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and are subject to important exceptions and limitations, including a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally relevant to investors, and are qualified by information in confidential disclosure letters that the parties exchanged in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement as well as information contained in Camerons and NATCOs public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).  In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties, rather than to establish matters as facts.  The Merger Agreement is described in this Current Report on Form 8-K and attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and, except for its status as a contractual document that establishes and governs the legal relationship among the parties thereto with respect to the Merger, not to provide any other factual information regarding the parties or their respective business or the actual conduct of their respective businesses during the pendency of the Merger Agreement.  Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about Cameron or NATCO.  Furthermore, investors should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Cameron and NATCO, because either party may take certain actions that are expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letters to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public.
 
 
 
The Merger Agreement contains provisions granting both Cameron and NATCO rights to terminate the Merger Agreement for certain reasons, including, among others, (1) if the Merger is not completed by March 31, 2010, (2) if NATCOs stockholders fail to approve the Merger Agreement, or (3) if a final and non-appealable governmental order, decree or ruling has been issued prohibiting the Merger.  In the event of a termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, NATCO may be required to pay Cameron a termination fee of $27.3 million, or Cameron or NATCO may be required to pay the other party its out-of-pocket costs related to the transaction but not to exceed $6 million.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purpose to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement which is filed as Exhibit 2.1, and is incorporated into this Current Report on Form 8-K by reference.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
Information set forth in this document may contain forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  Cameron cautions readers that any forward-looking information is not a guarantee of future performance and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking information. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the business combination transaction involving Cameron and NATCO, including future financial and operating results, the new companys plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts.
The following additional factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the ability to satisfy the closing conditions of the transaction, including obtaining regulatory approvals for the transaction and the approval of the merger agreement by the NATCO stockholders; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully; the risk that the cost savings and any other synergies from the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers; the impact of other acquisitions that Cameron or NATCO have made or may make before the transaction; competition and its effect on pricing; and exploration and development spending by E&P operators. Additional factors that may affect future results are contained in Camerons and NATCOs filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (), which are available at the SECs web site http://www.sec.gov.  Cameron and NATCO disclaim any obligation to update and revise statements contained in these materials based on new information or otherwise.

CAMERON TO ACQUIRE NATCO
HOUSTON (June 1, 2009)  Cameron (NYSE: CAM) and NATCO Group Inc. (NYSE: NTG) have entered into an agreement under which Cameron will acquire NATCO in an all-stock transaction that values NATCO at approximately $780 million, based on Camerons closing stock price on June 1, 2009.  Under the agreement, NATCO shareholders would receive 1.185 shares of Cameron common stock in return for each of NATCOs approximately 20.3 million shares outstanding.  The boards of directors of both Cameron and NATCO have unanimously approved the transaction, which is expected to close during the third quarter of 2009, subject to regulatory approvals, approval by a majority of NATCOs shareholders and other conditions.  Upon closing, NATCOs current shareholders would own approximately ten percent of Camerons outstanding common shares.
is a leading provider of process equipment, systems and services, including proprietary equipment and technologies, to the worldwide oil and gas industry.  NATCO has approximately 2,400 employees and generated revenues of more than $650 million during 2008.
NATCO
Cameron President and Chief Executive Officer Jack B. Moore said, The acquisition of NATCO represents a unique opportunity to acquire an unmatched portfolio of process technologies focused on electrostatic oil treating, COhandling utilizing proprietary membrane technology, and compact separation, along with a strategically positioned manufacturing and distribution/service network.  In combination with our Petreco Process Systems division, this will solidify Camerons position as a leading supplier of separation and processing solutions worldwide.  Moore noted that the acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flow during 2010, after adjusting for any transaction-related costs.  He also noted that the combination of these complementary businesses will immediately enhance both companies presence in the growing market for larger, more sophisticated process systems, especially in Southeast Asia, West Africa, the Middle East and Brazil; broaden the Companys product offerings with a wider range of proprietary technologies, particularly in deepwater production processing and downstream markets; provide cross-selling opportunities for certain of Camerons and NATCOs product lines; and will add manufacturing capability to Cameron in processing and separation products, a capability that Cameron does not have today.  In addition, NATCOs ongoing research and development activities relating to the emerging area of subsea processing will further advance Camerons capabilities in this field, Moore said. Finally, we are pleased to welcome NATCOs employees to the Cameron organization.

NATCO Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John U. Clarke said, We are pleased to have the opportunity to combine NATCOs products, business franchise and people with those of Cameron.  Our culture and business strategies are complementary and squarely aligned.  NATCOs board and management team believe this is the right transaction, with the right partner, at the right time.  The strength of our leading-edge technologies and diverse product offerings, together with Camerons broad reach and established infrastructure, creates opportunities to penetrate upstream and downstream markets faster than we could on our own.  We look forward to working with the Cameron organization to ensure a seamless and orderly combination.

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Scott Amann, Vice President of Investor Relations for Cameron.  Thank you, Mr. Amann, you may begin.
:  Thank you, Everett.
Mr. Scott Amann
Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.  This morning, you will hear from Jack Moore, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cameron, John Clarke, Chairman and CEO of NATCO, and Chuck Sledge, Cameron's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Jack, John, and Chuck will offer some brief comments, and we'll then take time to field your questions.
In accordance with the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Securities laws, we caution you that some of the statements made on this call may be forward-looking in nature and, as such, are subject to various factors not under the control of the companies.

With that, I will now turn things over to Jack.
:  Thank you, Scott.
Mr. Jack Moore
We welcome the chance to talk to you about Cameron's announced plans to acquire NATCO in an all-stock transaction.  I'll begin with a few brief comments, then you'll hear from John Clarke, NATCO's Chairman and CEO.  Chuck Sledge, our CFO, will have a few remarks regarding the deal terms, and then we'll field any questions that you may have.
NATCO is one of the leading process systems companies in the world, with a well-earned reputation for leading edge technology, quality products, and a responsive service organization.  Combined with Cameron, this will create a transformational step chance in our separation and process capabilities.
NATCO has operated in the process industry for over 80 years, serves onshore, offshore, and deepwater markets, operates in three groups:  the S&T, which is standard and traditional, which is their oil, gas, and water separation technology focused on the onshore markets with smaller, standardized processing equipment, including a very strong presence in the shale plays; their A&C, which is automation and controls which is focused on the subsea well automation, platform monitoring and process sampling, handling systems in a very big--and they're very big in Angola and the Gulf of Mexico; and then their IES, which is their Integrated Engineered Solutions group.
This is truly a global player for NATCO, targeting large scale, highly engineered, technology driven processing applications.  This business competes directly with Cameron's Petreco division.  This group is where NATCO has heavily invested in new technology, like the Cynara membrane technology used in CO2 capture, which is gaining wider use around the world and has a solid aftermarket story.
Other offerings include their dual frequency oil treating technology, electrostatic separation technology, compact separators, and cyclonic separation technology which they recently acquired through their ConSepT acquisition out of Norway.  And this is where a lot of their focus is moving, to the subsea markets.
NATCO has well-established relationships with IOCs and NOCs including Petrobras, PETRONAS, BP, Chevron, Aramco, and many others.  They are established in 40 worldwide service locations around the world with over 2,400 employees.  Their revenues in '08 exceeded 650 million.  Their backlog at the end of the first quarter of '09 was at 314 million.  They have over 400,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity.  They have proprietary technology, and they have a wonderful aftermarket story.
Now, Cameron's motivation for expanding our exposure in this industry is clear when you consider events of the past several years.  As the leading provider of flow equipment, systems, and services in the oil and gas industry, access to processing technology is critical.  We are consistently reminded that oil, gas, and water contaminants need to be processed on virtually every producing well in the world, both onshore and offshore.
Such technology is important to our customers' recovery rates, throughput volumes, capacity utilization, uptime, and HS&E compliance and cost.  And we made our first step forward in this area with the 2004 acquisition of Petreco, Cameron's entree in the process systems industry.
 
 
 
Through Petreco, we targeted larger scale engineered process driven applications, and have been able to provide technology for both gas and oil treatment solutions for major installations, both onshore and offshore, particularly in the international markets.  In fact, our subsea processing initiative was launched with Petreco technology and personnel.
NATCO will provide a major expansion of our footprint in the strategic market, and enhances our role as a leader in this segment of the industry.  This is a combination of two top performers in process technology world, and creates one organization that can help our customers with process solutions in the onshore, offshore, and deepwater markets, again, all over the world.
Among the benefits we see, first of all, let me address new markets for Cameron.  Combining proprietary technologies to target deepwater markets, precisely the patented technologies embedded in DES, the ConSepT, and the Cynara membranes in the MEG units that both Petreco and Cameron have evolved, will be critical to this market.  We create a business and technology critical mass that supports both expanding our R&D in both deep water and subsea markets as they evolve.  Added markets for packaging of Cameron's broader product lines, including our valves, our compression, our measurement, and our wellhead divisions, leveraging Cameron's broad international footprint, leveraging NATCO's distribution and service network are going to be critical to our ability to expand our markets and our footprint as we move forward.  And post acquisition, there will be few parts of the world where we won't have a major presence and be a major factor.
The financial synergies.  We estimate that the combination will generate 30 to 40 million in synergy savings.  We expect improved manufacturing utilization from reducing our levels of outsourcing.
If you guys remember, NATCO is a primary manufacturer of separation and process equipment.  Cameron outsources most of this technology today.  So, this is a great opportunity for us to leverage the infrastructure that NATCO brings, and we expect to realize consolidated cost savings with our supply chain.
And finally, let me talk about the people synergies that we create.  Some of the brightest and most dedicated minds in the process business exist within Petreco and NATCO's organizations.  Combining these talent pools will provide benefits to Cameron, its customers, and the industry as a whole as we move forward.
Now, I would like to turn it over to John Clarke, Chairman and CEO of NATCO, for his comments.
:  Thanks, Jack. With me this morning are Patrick McCarthy, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Andy Smith, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Mr. John Clarke
From NATCO's shareholders' perspective, this transaction makes terrific sense for a number of reasons.  As a stock-for-stock deal, our shareholders will participate in the value creation opportunity that the combination provides.
As Jack mentioned, the synergies from cost savings alone are significant.  And for our shareholders and our employees, we join forces with a highly regarded and growing oil services company that has a global footprint, balance sheet, and infrastructure that would take years and years and tens of billions of dollars for us to replicate.
Bringing together our integrated engineered solutions technology portfolio and products with those of Petreco give us a broader offering for our global markets and speeds the time to further penetrate key markets like Southeast Asia, Brazil, the Middle East, and West Africa where Cameron's local presence will help on local content requirements in these developing markets.  And importantly, we gain greater access to the downstream refinery market as well.
These are significant opportunities.  But, I would also point out that our strategic manufacturing, distribution, and service network, in combination with Cameron's gas compression business, presents an opportunity for us to serve the North American gas market as it structurally evolves with greater focus on exploitation of shale plays where centralized processed is likely to require more highly engineered and linked solutions, including process equipment and compression.
The combination also provides us with the opportunity to step up capital spending on R&D, leveraging our new lab for new product development in electrostatics, CO2 membrane separation, high performance compact separation, and water injection technologies.  And perhaps most exciting for the future, it links our subsea processing initiatives with Cameron's capabilities.
We expect to work closely with Jack and Chuck and their teams to accomplish a smooth transition for our employees and customers, and to contribute meaningfully to the company's continued growth.
On a personal note, my time with NATCO has been among the most challenging and satisfying in my career.  The talent and dedication of the management team, especially the leadership of Patrick McCarthy and the employee team, is second to none.  And I thank them and acknowledge that their success has made this transaction possible.
 
 
 
I believe that the combination will put the best athletes on the field from both companies, and presents exciting opportunities for career advancement.  Our board has been steadfast in their support of our business strategies, and is squarely behind this transaction as the best way to maximize value for our shareholders going forward.
Finally, I appreciate the support of our shareholders and look forward to a favorable vote on the transaction later this summer.  Chuck?
:  Thanks, John.  Summarizing what Jack and John have said, this is a transformational combination for our separation and processing business.  The technologies and footprint the combined business brings to solve our customers' challenges, whether they be onshore or offshore, are impressive.  Couple this with the high level of synergies, and you get a compelling transaction for both parties.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
To summarize the key terms of the transaction, NATCO's shareholders will receive 1.185 Cameron shares for each share they hold.  This translates into Cameron issuing approximately 24 million shares in connection with this transaction.  NATCO's shareholders will own approximately 10 percent of Cameron's outstanding shares post-closing.  Based upon yesterday's closing price, this equates to a transaction value of approximately 780 million.
As Jack mentioned, we expect synergies in the $30 to $40 million range, so we expect this transaction to be accretive to 2010 earnings.
As noted in our release, this transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, including HSR clearance and approval of the NATCO shareholders.  We expect this transaction to close during the third quarter.
Scott, with that, let's open it up for questions.
:  Okay.  Everett, we can open it up for Q&A, please.
Mr. Scott Amann

And for participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Our first question today comes from the line of Eric Marzuka [sp] with Dominick and Dominick.  Please proceed with your question.
:  Yes.  Congratulations, guys.
Mr. Eric Marzuka
I wanted to ask a little bit about the process.  Was there actually a full auction process, or was it just a one-on-one negotiated process?
  No, this was negotiated one-on-one, Eric.
Mr. Jack Moore:
:  Okay. And is there any--how long was the process?  Is this a recent--you guys just recently started talks, or has this been ongoing for some time?
Mr. Eric Marzuka
  Eric, we have admired each other's capabilities for about three years.
Mr. Jack Moore:
  All that'll be laid out in the prospectus when it's filed later as well.
Mr. Chuck Sledge:
:  Okay.
Mr. Eric Marzuka
And one follow up.  As far as antitrust, do you guys expect any issues?  I know obviously Petreco is--you know, is a direct competitor.
  You know, while you can never really call what the antitrust regulators will do, we expect this transaction will not have any material issues in review.
Mr. Jack Moore:
:  Got you.
Mr. Eric Marzuka
And when do you guys expect to file the DMA?
:  We're working on it as quickly as we can.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:  Got you. And do you know the break fees?
Mr. Eric Marzuka
It's got customary deal protection, and we'll file the agreement here later today.
Mr. Chuck Sledge:  
:  Thank you very much, guys.  Congratulations again.
Mr. Eric Marzuka
  Thanks.
Mr. Jack Moore:
:  Thanks.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:  Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Robin Shoemaker with Citigroup.  Please proceed with your question.
:  Yes, thanks.  I was curious about a couple of things regarding NATCO.  And one is that, Jack, I think you mentioned several times the aftermarket.  What is the--kind of the component of aftermarket of NATCO's sales versus original equipment?
Mr. Robin Shoemaker
 
 
 
:  Thanks, Robin.  We're going to let Patrick answer that one.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  Good morning, everyone.  Patrick McCarthy.
Mr. Patrick McCarthy
NATCO--and I'm coming off the top of my head with this.  But, about 30 percent of our revenue is an aftermarket revenue, as you look at the US being the prime contributor in North America for the 30 percent.  And then globally, we have export parts that go into the international arena, looking at the Middle East, Southeast Asia, West Africa, and Brazil.
:  Okay.
Mr. Robin Shoemaker
And is this a situation where typically original equipment and aftermarket margins are different?  Or, in your case, are they roughly comparable?
:  The aftermarket margins are what you would expect of any aftermarket service work in parts supply, attractive margins for the shareholder.
Mr. Patrick McCarthy
:  Okay.
Mr. Robin Shoemaker
My next one--.
  --Robin, to put that in perspective, from Cameron's view, our aftermarket revenues as a percent of our total run about 22 percent, a little less than 25 percent in the current environment.
Mr. Jack Moore:
:  Okay.  Good.
Mr. Robin Shoemaker
And the margins behave a lot like--.
Mr. Jack Moore:  
:  --Yeah--.
Mr. Patrick McCarthy
:  --Cameron's.
Mr. Scott Amann
:  And the margin's similar.  Okay.  Thank you.
Mr. Robin Shoemaker
Just the other question I had was you mentioned in the press release that NATCO has been working on subsea processing, subsea separation.  I wonder if you could describe what your R&D effort there is, and how far along it is.
:  Sure.  Again, Patrick McCarthy.
Mr. Patrick McCarthy
We have been addressing the subsea application process for some number of years in our lab in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  And we have a working model that has proven solidly in terms of the results of the output of the separation of a continuous flow of water in an oil stream.
And what we are looking to do in conjunction with a joint industry project we have with Petrobras is we'll take it to the field in Brazil onshore in November of this year, and we will test the application.  But, we're looking forward to a process that takes as much as 60 and 70 percent water cuts through a continuous flow of oil to some level of single digit parts per million of outlet water.
And again, we're--this is a derivative of NATCO's electrostatic technologies, and we refer to this as our compact separation.
:  Okay.  Compact.
Mr. Robin Shoemaker
Okay.  Thank you very much.
:  You're welcome.
Mr. Patrick McCarthy
:  Thank you.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, our next question come from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Jefferies and Company.  Please proceed with your question.
:   Thanks.  Good morning, gentlemen.
Mr. Stephen Gengaro
  Morning, Stephen.
Mr. Jack Moore:
:  Morning, Stephen.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:   Two questions.  I guess I'll start with the CO2 membrane technology, which is obviously a terrific technology and proprietary to NATCO.  How--have you investigated and looked at opportunities outside Southeast Asia, and sort of how do you think that sort of plays out?  And where do you think the best growth areas are over the next couple of years?
Mr. Stephen Gengaro
:  Well, Stephen, this is John.  As you know and we've talked about before, while this CO2 membrane technology is being readily accepted into the Southeast Asia market, particularly in the Malaysian offshore, we have also sold, in the early part of last year, an offshore project, offshore Libya.
Mr. John Clarke
And in terms of opportunity going forward, one of the biggest opportunities we see is what's going on in the subsalt offshore Brazil, where the three fields, Tupi, Iara, and Guara, have all been announced.  And they all have large associated gas with high concentration CO2, which we believe is a brand new market opportunity for deployment of the membrane.
 
 
 
:  Great.  Now, that's helpful.
Mr. Stephen Gengaro
And then secondly, maybe Chuck, can you give--you talked about the cost synergies.  Can you talk about the timing when you would sort of expect them to be realized on a run rate basis?
:  You know, obviously our transition teams are going to start working on that.  But, clearly, we'll have the majority of the synergies within the first year.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:  Great.  That's helpful.  Thank you.
Mr. Stephen Gengaro
:  Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Wunderlich Securities.  Please proceed with your question.
:  Morning, guys.
Mr. Neal Dingmann
:  Morning, Neal.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  Hey, Neal.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:  Say projected, John, do you perceive any difficulties on maintaining any of, you know, NATCO's strategic JVs such as Scomi?
Mr. Neal Dingmann
:  No, I don't.
Mr. John Clarke
:  Yeah.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  I think our JV partners are likely to look at this in the same positive fashion that our shareholders are.  In each instance, it gives us greater stability, more product offerings.  So, I think those--these will all be very well received.
Mr. John Clarke
:  In fact, we have the same JV partner in the Middle East.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  Got you.  Got you.  Interesting.  Okay.
Mr. Neal Dingmann
And then, do you anticipate most--I think it said in the press release, but do you anticipate most NATCO management ops staff remaining on?
:  I'm not sure that we said that in the press release.
Mr. John Clarke
:  I don't think we did.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  But, as we look at this going forward, this is a great combination with not a heck of a lot of overlap in the operational parts of our businesses worldwide.  So, we think that net-net, it's a very big positive for our employee group.
Mr. John Clarke
Obviously, there are some redundancies that occur mostly at the corporate level.  But, you know, that's what we sign up for.  So, I think the employee group will be quite excited about this opportunity going forward.
:  You know, I would characterize this as this is a great combination that builds a bigger and better business for our company going forward.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  Got it.  Got it.
Mr. Neal Dingmann
And then lastly, is there any sort of collar on this stock deal, or will the S-4 lay out anything in that regard?
:  No, it's a straight exchange ratio.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  Straight exchange ratio?  Okay. Thanks, guys.
Mr. Neal Dingmann
:  Yep.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Natixis Bleichroeder.  Please proceed with your question.
Operator
:  Yeah.  Good morning, gentlemen.
Mr. Roger Read
:  Morning, Roger.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  Morning, Roger.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:  I guess real quick, I look at the margin difference between the two companies.  Just trying to understand, within NATCO, is there--is that true across the board the margins are going to be a little less than in the subsea segment?  Or, are we looking at, you know, parts of the business at NATCO are different and parts are very similar, I mean, as I look at product and service breakdown, for example?
Mr. Roger Read
  Yeah, I think when you look at it, you--the publicly disclosed margins of the different business units has a lot of corporate cost embedded in it.  They don't show it as a separate segment.
Mr. Chuck Sledge:
And so, when you look across it, I think those margins look at lot like comparable businesses in Cameron.
:  Okay.  So, once you get it, the 30 to 40 million in cost savings and kind reorg the business, we'd look for similar performance?
Mr. Roger Read
:  Yep.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  Yep.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
 
 
 
:  Okay. And then, as you looked at kind of the drivers of this merger, you've mentioned, you know, it fits up very well with Petreco.  Could you give us a little bit of an idea, you know, I guess from both perspectives, but sort of where does the NATCO business match up well with what Petreco wasn't doing or vice versa?
Mr. Roger Read
:  I would tell you that what Petreco was to water separation, you know, these--NATCO is to oil and gas separation.  And both of us have wonderful gas separation technology, but the combination of the two really--I mean, the membrane technology, electrostatic technology, the compact--this--their ability to make things in a more compact way, especially as we target the offshore markets and as we go subsea, that's a huge step change for us in terms of getting us where we want to go much faster than we would otherwise doing it on our own.
Mr. Jack Moore
The leverage with the R&D, you know, NATCO has spent a tremendous amount of time and energy and money over the years focused on R&D, more so than we had at Cameron, quite honestly.  And I--the volume that we can leverage with that and accelerate it is going to be a great story.
Now, when you take S&T, Cameron wasn't in that business.  But, when you look at the markets they serve, you look at where they're positioned, you look at their distribution network, you look at their service infrastructure, and you start saying how do we put that to work and, you know, involving it with our surface systems business, with our compression business, with our measurement business, with our valve businesses, guys, it creates a very compelling picture for where Cameron can go in terms of providing not only a process solution but production solutions to the onshore markets.
And it's far more than just the US.  It's Latin America.  It's the Middle East.  It's the evolving markets in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, where we, Cameron, have a substantial footprint and where NATCO has a presence as well.
So, I'm telling you we're very excited about the doors it opens up to create new markets in addition to leveraging the businesses we currently kind of cohabitate in, and that's in that engineered solutions business.
:  Okay. So, it sounds like it's fair--.
Mr. Roger Read
:  --Excited about it.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  Well, that's great.  It sounds like it'd be fair for us to assume that this accelerates how quickly Cameron would be able to offer a fully integrated subsea separation system.
Mr. Roger Read
:  Absolutely.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  Okay.
Mr. Roger Read
:  Absolutely.  And as that--you know, that market will evolve over time.  I think we all agree with that.  But, let me tell you there's a bunch of opportunities with this combination that will ring the bell before that one will.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  Okay.  That's good to know.  And then, my final question, you kind of, at the beginning, mentioned NATCO's presence in some of the gas shales.  Could you just walk me through what that is?  And then, that's it for me.
Mr. Roger Read
:  All right.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  Yeah, this is Patrick McCarthy again.
Mr. Patrick McCarthy
In the gas shale plays, when you look at the Barnett, you look at the Haynesville, you look at the Marcellus, we have footprint that presently exists.  And Barnett's a good example of where we've grown our business immensely in the past three years.
The Marcellus and the Haynesville are opportunities today as well as in the near term for the expansion of larger high pressure gas treating facilities.  And as we talk about all of what Jack just mentioned, the integration of this production equipment with compression equipment is a solution that becomes a broader overall solution in the capex lease opportunity marketplace.
So, we see many opportunities in the shale plays in the US.  And as you look and hear about the Statoils and the Chesapeakes looking internationally, obviously that's--we would go with them.
 :  Thank you.
Mr. Roger Read
:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte with JPMorgan.  Please proceed with your question.
Operator
:  Thanks and congratulations, gentlemen.
Mr. Michael LaMotte
:  Thanks, Mike.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  John, if you wouldn't mind refreshing my memory, did you have a technology or an R&D venture with a competitor of Cameron's that was signed a couple years ago for onshore separation?
Mr. Michael LaMotte
 
 
 
:  We had a very narrow focus joint venture effort with FMC that, I think, ran its course in early 2005.
Mr. John Clarke
:  Okay.
Mr. Michael LaMotte
:  '05 and '06.
Mr. John Clarke
:  So, that's ancient history at this point?
Mr. Michael LaMotte
:  Ancient history.
Mr. John Clarke
:  Okay.  And then, you mentioned in your prepared comments a capex step up as one of the benefits to NATCO.  Can you quantify that at all in sort of where directly that--you know, that would be targeted?
Mr. Michael LaMotte
:  Well, maybe I'll give you a little history.  And then, I think that's an answer that Jack and Chuck should weigh in.
Mr. John Clarke
:  Okay.
Mr. Michael LaMotte
:  You know, as a small company, NATCO has been capital constrained on dollars that we could put into pure R&D.  But, one of the things that we have utilized quite effectively is customer money in solving specific processing issues where they would fund studies.  We retain the IP and build that library over the last 40 years of doing so.
Mr. John Clarke
The other thing I would point out that is a little misleading in terms of the absolute spending level on R&D is we have acquired a number of the technologies that we are now--have refined and are deploying into the marketplace through acquisitions that were made in the late 1990s and before the public--before the company went public.
We've added several since then, so you have to kind of look at the customer spend, our own nickel, and then what we have acquired.  And I think going forward, it gives the company a lot more flexibility to do more targeted R&D and product development.  We have traditionally avoided science projects, and we like applying technology to things that we can sell and make money off of.
:  I appreciate that color.  Thank you.
Mr. Michael LaMotte
  Yeah.  And I'll just add as well that this gives us just a larger footprint.  And as we've talked about in the rest of our businesses, first and foremost, our cash flows goes to reinvesting in ourselves.  So, you will see us treat this business no differently than any of the other businesses we have.
Mr. Chuck Sledge:
:  You know, when you look at the combination of Cameron's and NATCO's businesses, we're--we create a business that's approaching $1 billion in size.  It's a pretty sizeable footprint for us.

Mr. Jeff Tillery
:  Morning, Jeff.
Mr. John Clarke
:  Morning, Jeff.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  Chuck, on the cost synergies, could you help us out in just thinking about the relative components of kind of insourcing versus true cost savings?  I guess your separation business was somewhere around $250 million revenue last year.  Could you just help us out with kind of the order of magnitude of insourcing opportunities there are?
Mr. Jeff Tillery
:  Well, there was a quite bit.  As Jack said, that we--Petreco does not do any manufacturing itself, and NATCO has quite a manufacturing footprint.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
So, those are opportunities that the transitions teams will continue to define.  And I'm sure those opportunities will evolve over time.
:  Would you say that the pure cost saves are greater than the insourcing opportunities, or vice versa?
Mr. Jeff Tillery
:  Oh, I think the pure cost savings are greater.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:  All right.
Mr. Jeff Tillery
And just on the combined company tax rate, should we look for it to be more similar to what Cameron is currently reporting than NATCO?
:  I think over time there is a lot of opportunity to leverage some of our tax strategies with NATCO.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
 
 
 
:  And then, my last question just kind of around the all-stock composition.  I would assume that that was driven by the NATCO side, kind of given CAM's cash on hand.  Could you just give us some thoughts around kind of carrying that 1.5 billion cash balance and whether or not there are very many cash acquisition opportunities for you guys?
Mr. Jeff Tillery
:  I think that's going to evolve over time.  Obviously, this is a transaction, as John said, that allows the NATCO shareholders to participate on the upside of what we've created here, which is pretty compelling.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
You typically have to pay the currency that the seller is willing to take.  And just like we've always said, we've got a lot of dry powder.  And at some point, something will come along that will rather the cash currency instead of the stock currency.
:  And Chuck, I would just add from the NATCO perspective, as we mentioned earlier, we were not for sale.  This was not a sale process.  We believe that this is a strategic combination that makes good sense for our shareholders longer term.  And we would have had no interest in pursuing a cash transaction because we were not for sale.
Mr. John Clarke
:  Great.  That's great color, guys.  Thank you very much.
Mr. Jeff Tillery
:  Yep.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Judy Delgado with Alpine Associates.  Please proceed with your question.
Operator
:  Yes.  Good morning.  All of my questions have been answered.  Thank you.
Ms. Judy Delgado
:  Good.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  Yeah.
Mr. John Clarke
:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Marzuka with Dominick and Dominick.  Please proceed with your question.
Operator
:   Oh, hi.  It's Tony Reiner just for Eric for a second.  And so, do you--what are your comments on the fact that you might have some first mover advantage or early mover advantage by this deal?  How do you view consolidation, you know, from some of your competitors or, you know, other colleagues in the business?  Do you think there is more consolidation to follow?  What's your thoughts on that?
Mr. Tony Reiner
:  That's a--who knows?  I think, as we've said, we've admired each other's capabilities for several years and have seen the benefits that NATCO and Cameron can evolve for our customers and our employees and our shareholders.
Mr. Jack Moore
And, you know, quite honestly, we think this is a combination that--I wouldn't say any of it's unique.  But, truly, it creates some unique capabilities for both of our companies.  And I don't know that a whole lot of other folks out there in these businesses can create what we're going to be able to create.
:   Okay.  Appreciate it.  Thanks so much.
Mr. Tony Reiner
:  Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Philip Dodge with Tuohy Brothers.  Please proceed with your question.
Operator
:  Yeah.  Thanks for the comments. Could you elaborate a little bit about synergies in the Middle East including, I believe, a new NATCO plant in Saudi Arabia?
Mr. Philip Dodge
:  Yeah, let me talk to that one, Phillip.  It's interesting.  We both have the same joint venture partner in the Middle East.  I'm sure he'll be excited to see that.  He's--he knows who we are.  We know who he is.  And I've--you know, the leverage of that infrastructure is not only geared to just Saudi.  It is geared to the entire Middle East.
Mr. Jack Moore
And when you look--again, if you--you know, our view of this market is longer term.  And if you look at where, you know, this infrastructure is going to evolve over the coming years, the Middle East is going to be a huge, huge driver for process and separation technologies.
And this clearly is going to be a commitment that NATCO had established on the ground that not only launches, you know, the infrastructure to support the building of it, but all the things you can bolt onto it and drive from that one footprint.
And that's what we've found with our joint ventures in the Middle East is where we may go in and set up an aftermarket center for drilling technology or building wellhead equipment in-country as we do in the Middle East now, it opens up so many more doors for your other technologies that you can pull through.  And that's exactly what NATCO established this footprint to do.  And, you know, I firmly believe we're going to be able to accelerate that yet again with what we're going to create together.
 
 
 
:  And what's the initial utilization rate that you're going to show on that plant?
Mr. Philip Dodge
:  Well, that's--.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  --This is a Greenfield plant.  It's not even finished with the construction process yet.  So, we believe that it'll be ramping up to full capacity probably by the early part, middle part of next year.
Mr. John Clarke
:  And that will serve, you said, the entire Middle East--?
Mr. Philip Dodge
:  --And I should say--.
Mr. John Clarke
:  --Not just Saudi?
Mr. Philip Dodge
:  Yeah, that is correct.  It has the capabilities to serve the region.
Mr. John Clarke
And I should say to correct my answer, that's on a NATCO standalone basis.  I believe if we are able to get some of these synergies, that perhaps we can accelerate that utilization.
:  Okay.  Thanks very much.
Mr. Philip Dodge
:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Collin Gerry with Raymond James.  Please proceed with your question.
Operator
:  Hey, good morning.
Mr. Collin Gerry
:  Hey, Collin.
Mr. John Clarke
:  Morning, Collin.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  Collin.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:  I got--most of mine have been answered.  I've got a real quick one.  On the asset writeup for you guys--for NATCO, what can we assume there?  I apologize if I missed that.  And what does that do on a D&A level?
Mr. Collin Gerry
:  Obviously, there are going to be some step-ups in the assets.  The transition teams will work through that.  Again, we've looked at it on a number of scenarios, and we don't think it's going to affect the ability of this transaction to be accretive.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
We'll give you guys more guidance as we get through the process.
:  Okay.
Mr. Collin Gerry
And then, I kind of want to go back to maybe trying to quantify some of the synergies or the revenue acceleration opportunities.  You know, NATCO, you guys have kind of been, on an operating margin basis, 10, 9 percent range.  Cameron, you know, closer to the mid-teens.
Just with the operational synergies, have y'all--doing very similar businesses and being in very similar regions, where do you think that those margins go to, you know, if you exclude just the easy corporate overhead eliminations and so forth?
:  I think, like I said earlier on the call, that this business really shouldn't behave much differently than any other Cameron business once its been integrated.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:  Okay.  Fair--that's perfect.  Thanks, guys.  Congratulations again.
Mr. Collin Gerry
:  Yeah.  Appreciate it.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:  Thanks.
Mr. John Clarke
:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Simpson with Miller Tabak.  Please proceed with your question.
Operator
:  Thanks and good morning.  Couple quick questions, maybe more follow ups than anything else.
Mr. Kevin Simpson
On the--an integrated seafloor separation system, assuming that the Petrobras test goes as you expect, do you think you'll be able to be bidding on projects by the end of next year or sometime in early 2011?  I'd just like some idea on what the possible timing might be.
:  Kevin, let me answer that.  And I would just say--and Patrick may want to jump in.  But, you know, it's hard to predict the timing of when these are going to happen.  And the success of these tests will obviously accelerate anything that happens to the seabed.
Mr. Jack Moore
But, I would not want to venture to say when Petrobras would give a green light to go to subsea.
Patrick?
:  I agree, Jack.  And not to get too far in front of all of all this, the whole marinization process of the equipment that we're testing on the surface has to go through its design requirements.  And that's still in front of us to accomplish that task.
Mr. Patrick McCarthy
Right now, the task is to evaluate the technology for a very productive separation process.
 
 
 
:  Okay.  Thanks on that.
Mr. Kevin Simpson
And then, I mean for Jack or Chuck, I'm not--I know that, you know, the NATCO management clearly wanted and shareholders, I think, would want stock, which makes sense down here in the cycle.  But, have you considered or is it on the table to do some--use some of that cash for repurchase of shares to kind of mitigate some of the share dilution?  Or, do you think, Jack, that there's still enough, you know, potential acquisitions out there that you'd rather keep your--you know, all that powder dry?
:  Let me answer that in that those options are all available to us.  We still have authorization from the board that's quite--I think gives us quite a bit of, you know, leeway in doing that from the share buyback options, and there's other options that we want to consider.
Mr. Jack Moore
But, primarily, I think you'll want to--you know, as any time in the cycle, we'll want to keep our powder dry to take advantage of opportunities as well that could come up.
Chuck, you want to add anything to that?
:  Oh, I'd just add that, again, this transaction is accretive without buying back any of the shares.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:  Exactly.
Mr. Jack Moore
:  So, we'll just continue how we've always operated our share buyback.  We'll mow the grass.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:  Okay.  So, the inclination probably would not to be--you know, you're comfortable enough with how this--the accretion here on, you know, that--you're--you probably wouldn't do something incremental on the buyback side?  That's--.
Mr. Kevin Simpson
:  --We are--.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:  --What's I'm getting from that.
Mr. Kevin Simpson
:  Yeah.  We are comfortable that we do not need to go and do anything, as far as a share buyback, to make this thing accretive.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:  Okay.  Thanks.  That's it for me.
Mr. Kevin Simpson
:  Yep.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
:  Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte with JPMorgan.  Please proceed with your question.
:  Hi.  I wanted to follow up on that line of questioning we were on before in terms of the capex.  I just want to--on a pro forma basis, if I looked at the capex for the two companies today and we go into 2010, 2011, is it sort of a straight add, or are we talking about stepping up sort of NATCO's side 10 percent, 20 percent?  Any kind of--you know, maybe as a percentage of revenue.  Some kind of reinvestment rate gauge that you could give us.
Mr. Michael LaMotte
:  You know, again, our transition teams will kind of work through that.  And talking about capex in 201l may be a little premature.
Mr. Chuck Sledge
But, over the course of the fullness of time, I don't think the capex we'll spend in this business will be any different than what we spent--what we have spent in any of our other businesses.
:  Okay.  Thanks.
Mr. Michael LaMotte
:  And Chuck, if you'd like, I can add one comment, that if you look at NATCO's standalone 2009 capex, it's actually quite robust because of two large projects, one being the migration to Oracle, which is our enterprise system.  And then secondly, we are finishing construction of a lab in Houston that also has bloated our capital budgets a bit.
Mr. John Clarke
:  Okay.  That's helpful.  Thank you.
Mr. Michael LaMotte
And then, Jack, maybe this question of revenue pull through particularly overseas or leveraging NATCO  products through your footprint.  No real hard numbers on that, obviously, in the slides.  But, you know, if I start to think about it in terms of percentage of NATCO sales, it's not unrealistic to assume 10 or 20 percent, don't you think?
:  Well, I'll tell you.  Let the transition teams sort that out.  I will say they're both very excited about the possibilities that the combination of the technologies can create.  I know that Petreco guys are very excited about the membrane technology just to--you know, just in and of itself.
Mr. Jack Moore
But, I think as we can let the teams work together to evolve those technologies that fit and towards the applications that are out there in the marketplace, we're going to see some incremental opportunities we haven't seen on our own.
 
 
 
:  Fair enough.
Mr. Michael LaMotte
And then, last one for me.  John, can you give us a sense as to what the upstream/downstream split is in sales as well as the onshore/offshore mix?
:  For NATCO, the vast majority of our revenue is into the upstream market.  We have just recently started to penetrate the downstream market.  And we see that as one of the big advantages of folding in with Petreco, who has been a longtime player in the refinery space.
Mr. John Clarke
:  Um-hmm.  And then, the offshore/onshore split?
Mr. Michael LaMotte
:  Offshore/onshore split?
Mr. Jack Moore
:  It's probably about 60 percent, I would say, all in offshore, meaning offshore of the US.  It may be onshore work in other countries, but that's about the split, I would guess.
Mr. John Clarke
:  Okay.
Mr. Michael LaMotte
:  Fifty-five to 60 percent.
Mr. John Clarke
:  Okay, great.  Thanks so much.
Mr. Michael LaMotte
:  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Marino with Johnson Rice and Company.  Please proceed with your question.
Operator
:  Oh, hi.  This is actually Joe Agular at Johnson Rice.
Mr. Joe Agular
You all have covered a lot of ground already.  I just had a couple quick questions, one on the geography.  You know, could you highlight maybe a few markets where you think Cameron might help NATCO or NATCO might help Cameron?
:  Well, we have infrastructure on the ground in Malaysia.  We have infrastructure on the ground in Brazil.  We have infrastructure on the ground in West Africa.  We have infrastructure on the ground in Mexico.
Mr. Jack Moore
It--you know, you look at the markets for--that we see that are evolving for the separation and processing industry.  So, where--our big spends are going to happen over the coming years where local content is valued and rewarded.  I think where we sit gives NATCO a--it just propels them into a more instant solution.  They've had great relationships with customers in these regions already, which is a huge asset for us to leverage.
So, combined where they already have great relationships with these customers, where we have infrastructure and great relationships with these customers, it's just a wonderful combination.
:  Okay. Second part, I guess, is from a--you know, a technical standpoint, it just seems--I know historically NATCO's competitors have seemed to be a lot of--you know, more smaller, local firms where, you know, it seems like the direction of the business is heading to much more, you know, higher technology applications.  And just wonder if you could give some broad comments on maybe that trend and why, you know, this fit makes so much sense from that standpoint.  Thanks.
Mr. Joe Agular
:  Okay.  I'll just speak from Cameron's standpoint that, you know, when we acquired Petreco in '04, that's exactly what we saw the trend in terms of the highly engineered, more highly speced process and separation systems.  And it's just natural.  It's the same evolution that's happened with our deepwater markets, you know, more highly complex requirements.
Mr. Jack Moore
And let me tell you, customers, they want to hang out with people who are well funded, who have the technology, who have a commitment to engineering background, who have a commitment to put the infrastructure on the ground to support what they sell.  This is where you're separating the men from the boys.
And NATCO's seen the same thing in their evolution of their business from being the small--you know, competing with the small guys in East Texas or West Texas.  Their business has matured and expanded to the much more highly engineered, highly technical, more proprietary technology driven markets.
And Patrick, you can add to that.
:  Yeah.  We--over the years, you've heard us talk to it on the earnings calls.  And John has addressed it at all the analyst presentations and investment presentations.
Mr. Patrick McCarthy
But, for NATCO, it's been understanding that the global marketplace has more contaminants within the gas streams, more heavy, salty driven oils, more water drive from the older reservoirs, and all this requires a technology product line to efficiently process.  And for us, that's where this whole relationship adds just lots of value.
:  Okay.  That's it.  Thank you very much.
Mr. Joe Agular
:  Processing isn't what it used to be, today.  That's what we have all discovered here in the last few years.
Mr. Jack Moore
