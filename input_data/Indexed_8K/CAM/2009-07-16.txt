EXHIBIT 14.1
 
Introduction.
This Code of Ethics for Directors has been adopted by the Board of Directors of Cameron International Corporation to promote honest and ethical conduct and compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and standards.  The Board recognizes that no code of conduct and ethics can replace the thoughtful behavior of an ethical Director.  Such a code, however, can focus attention on areas of ethical risk, provide guidance to help recognize and deal with ethical issues, and help to foster a culture of honesty and accountability.
Any waiver of the Code may be made only by the Board of Directors or a Committee of the Board, and must be disclosed promptly to shareholders.
Principles and Practices.
In performing his or her duties, a Director of Cameron International Corporation should abide by the following principles:
Directors should inform the Chairman of the Nominating & Governance Committee and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company prior to accepting a director or officer position or other affiliation with a for-profit entity.
