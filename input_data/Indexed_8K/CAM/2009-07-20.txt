Cameron International Corporation (the Company) is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K (this Report) to reflect certain required accounting adjustments described below with respect to the financial information contained in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 (the 2008 Form 10-K) filed on February 25, 2009.  Neither this Report nor the Exhibits hereto reflect any events occurring on or after February 25, 2009 or modify or update the disclosures in the 2008 Form 10-K that may have been affected by subsequent events.  Accordingly, this Report should be read in conjunction with the 2008 Form 10-K and the Companys filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission subsequent to the filing of the 2008 Form 10-K, including any amendments to those filings.
As previously disclosed in the 2008 Form 10-K, in May 2008 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1), which clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement) upon conversion.  FSP APB 14-1 requires issuers of convertible debt instruments within its scope to separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that reflects the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized.  FSP APB 14-1 requires bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in the issuers consolidated results of operations.  FSP APB 14-1 is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2009 and early adoption was not permitted.  However, once adopted, FSP APB 14-1 requires retrospective application to the terms of instruments within its scope as they existed for all periods presented.  The Company has chosen to apply this new standard to its existing 1.5% convertible debentures issued in 2004 and due in 2024 and its 2.5% convertible debentures issued in 2006 and due in 2026, which were outstanding during the three year period ended December 31, 2008.  The retrospective application of this FSP affects years 2004 through 2008.
The Company has adjusted in Exhibit 99.1 certain portions of the 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders to reflect the Companys retrospective application of FSP APB 14-1.

Orbit
Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were generated from shipments to the following regions of the world (dollars in millions):
In addition to the historical data contained herein, this Annual Report, including the information set forth in the Companys Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report, may include forward-looking statements regarding future market strength, customer spending and order levels, revenues and earnings of the Company, as well as expectations regarding equipment deliveries, margins, profitability, the ability to control and reduce raw material, overhead and operating costs, cash generated from operations, capital expenditures and the use of existing cash balances and future anticipated cash flows made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Companys actual results may differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. Any such statements are based on current expectations of the Companys performance and are subject to a variety of factors, some of which are not under the control of the Company, which can affect the Companys results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. Such factors may include overall demand for, and pricing of, the Companys products; the size and timing of orders; the Companys ability to successfully execute large subsea and drilling projects it has been awarded; the possibility of cancellations of orders in backlog; the Companys ability to convert backlog into revenues on a timely and profitable basis; the impact of acquisitions the Company has made or may make; changes in the price of (and demand for) oil and gas in both domestic and international markets; raw material costs and availability; political and social issues affecting the countries in which the Company does business; fluctuations in currency markets worldwide; and variations in global economic activity. In particular, current and projected oil and gas prices historically have generally directly affected customers spending levels and their related purchases of the Companys products and services. Additionally, changes in oil and gas price expectations may impact the Companys financial results due to changes in cost structure, staffing and spending levels. See additional factors discussed in Factors That May Affect Financial Condition and Future Results contained herein.

Because the information herein is based solely on data currently available, it is subject to change as a result of, among other things, changes in conditions over which the Company has no control or influence, and should not therefore be viewed as assurance regarding the Companys future performance. Additionally, the Company is not obligated to make public indication of such changes unless required under applicable disclosure rules and regulations. 
The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to costs to be incurred on projects where the Company utilizes Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction  Type and Certain Production  Type Contracts (SOP 81-1) for revenue recognition, warranty obligations, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, assets held for sale, exposure to liquidated damages, income taxes, pensions and other postretirement benefits, other employee benefit plans, and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
 
Critical Accounting Policies
 
The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. These policies and the other sections of the Companys Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition have been reviewed with the Companys Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
  The Company generally recognizes revenue once the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery of the equipment has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the price of the equipment or service is fixed and determinable and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. For certain engineering, procurement and construction-type contracts, which typically include the Companys subsea and drilling systems and processing equipment contracts, revenue is recognized in accordance with SOP 81-1.  Under SOP 81-1, the Company recognizes revenue on these contracts using a units-of-completion method. Under the units-of-completion method, revenue is recognized once the manufacturing process is complete for each unit specified in the contract with the customer, including customer inspection and acceptance, if required by the contract. This method requires the Company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project, which impacts the amount of gross margin the Company recognizes in each reporting period.  The Company routinely, and at least quarterly, reviews its estimates relating to total estimated contract profit or loss and recognizes changes in those estimates as they are determined.  Revenue associated with change orders is not included in the calculation of estimated profit on a contract until approved by the customer.  Costs associated with unapproved change orders are deferred if (i) the customer acknowledges a change has occurred and (ii) it is probable that the costs will be recoverable from the customer.  If these two conditions are not met, the costs are included in the calculation of estimated profit on the project.  Anticipated losses on contracts accounted for under SOP 81-1 are recorded in full in the period in which they become evident.
Revenue Recognition
Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include the abilities to properly execute the engineering and design phases consistent with our customers expectations, production efficiencies, and availabilities and costs of labor, materials and subcomponents.  These factors can significantly impact the accuracy of the Companys estimates and materially impact the Companys future period earnings.  Approximately 28%, 21% and 17% of the Company's revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, was recognized under SOP 81-1.
  The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Such allowances are based upon several factors including, but not limited to, historical experience, the length of time an invoice has been outstanding, responses from customers relating to demands for payment and the current and projected financial condition of specific customers. Were the financial condition of a customer to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to the Companys allowance for doubtful accounts. 
  
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
  The Companys aggregate inventories are carried at cost or, if lower, net realizable value. Inventories located in the United States and Canada are carried on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Inventories located outside of the United States and Canada are carried on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company provides a reserve for estimated obsolescence or excess quantities on hand equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value. The future estimated realizable value of inventory is generally based on the historical usage of such inventory. The Company ages its inventory with no recent demand and applies various valuation factors based on the number of years since the last demand from customers for such material. If future conditions cause a reduction in the Companys current estimate of realizable value, due to a decrease in customer demand, a drop in commodity prices or other market-related factors that could influence demand for particular products, additional provisions may be required. Additional information relating to the Companys allowance for obsolete and excess inventory may be found in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

 The Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), which requires that the Company estimate the fair value of each of its reporting units annually and compare such amounts to their respective book values to determine if an impairment of goodwill is required. Generally, this review is conducted during the first quarter of each annual period.  Due to the significant decline in the Companys stock price during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the large drop in oil and gas prices, an updated analysis was conducted as of the end of 2008.  For the 2008, 2007 and 2006 evaluations, the fair value was determined using discounted cash flows or other market-related valuation models. Certain estimates and judgments, including future earnings and cash flow levels and an appropriate current discount rate, are required in the application of the fair value models. Based upon each of the Companys evaluations, no impairment of goodwill was required. However, should the Companys estimate of the fair value of any of its reporting units decline dramatically in future periods due to changes in customer demand, market activity levels, interest rates or other factors which would impact future earnings and cash flow or market valuation levels, an impairment of goodwill could be required. Additional information relating to the Companys goodwill may be found in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Goodwill
 The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time of sale based upon historical experience, or, in some cases, when specific warranty problems are encountered. Should actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from the Companys current estimates, or should the Company reach a settlement for an existing warranty claim in an amount that is different from what has been previously estimated, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details surrounding the Companys warranty accruals. 
Product Warranty
 The Company accrues for costs relating to litigation, including litigation defense costs, claims and other contingent matters, including liquidated damage liabilities, when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable. Such estimates may be based on advice from third parties, amounts specified by contract, amounts designated by legal statute or managements judgment, as appropriate. Revisions to contingent liability reserves are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss. Amounts paid upon the ultimate resolution of contingent liabilities may be materially different from previous estimates and could require adjustments to the estimated reserves to be recognized in the period such new information becomes known. 
Contingencies
  The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company has considered all available evidence in assessing the need for valuation allowances, including future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Accordingly, the Company has recorded valuation allowances against certain of its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008. In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a part of its deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. 
Deferred Tax Assets
The Company also considers all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, except certain amounts primarily earned before 2003 and amounts previously subjected to tax in the U.S., to be permanently reinvested. Should the Company change its determination of earnings that it anticipates are to be remitted, it may be required to change the amount of deferred income taxes that are currently recorded. 
 The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments as assets and liabilities on a gross basis and measures them at fair value. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), hedge accounting is only applied when the derivative is deemed highly effective at offsetting changes in anticipated cash flows of the hedged item or transaction. Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other elements of comprehensive income until the underlying transactions are recognized in earnings, at which time any deferred hedging gains or losses are also recorded in earnings on the same line as the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative used as a cash flow hedge is recorded in earnings as incurred. The amounts recorded in earnings from ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 have not been material. The Company may at times also use forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. These contracts are not designated as hedges under SFAS 133. Therefore, the changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized in earnings as they occur and offset gains or losses on the related asset or liability. 
Derivative Financial Instruments
The determination of the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of many of the Companys derivative contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges is dependent to a large degree on estimates of the amount and timing of future anticipated cash flows associated with large projects or plant-wide inventory purchasing programs.  These estimates may change over time as circumstances change or may vary significantly from final actual cash flows.  Changes in these estimates that result in the derivative contracts no longer effectively offsetting the expected or actual changes in the anticipated cash flows could impact the amount of the change in the fair value of the derivative contracts that must be recognized immediately in earnings each period.   At December 31, 2008, the Company had a net liability of $45.8 million recorded in its Consolidated Balance Sheet reflecting the fair value of its open derivative contracts at that date and expects approximately $10.6 million of accumulated other elements of comprehensive income to be recognized into earnings during 2009.
  The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158) with regard to recognition of the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The measurement date for all of the Companys plans accounted for under SFAS 158 was December 31, 2008. SFAS 158 did not change the basic approach used by companies to measure plan assets, benefit obligations and annual net periodic benefit costs. These issues are expected to be addressed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) at a later date. Accordingly, the Company continues to follow the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS 106) in measuring its plan assets and benefit obligations as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 and in determining the amount of its net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. 
Pension and Postretirement Benefits Accounting
 
27
 
The assumptions used in calculating the pension amounts recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements included discount rates, interest costs, expected return on plan assets, retirement and mortality rates, inflation rates, salary growth and other factors. The Company based the discount rate assumptions of its defined benefit pension plan in the United Kingdom on the average yield at December 31, 2008 of a hypothetical high-quality bond portfolio (rated AA- or better) with maturities that approximately matched the estimated cash flow needs of the plan.  The Companys inflation assumption was based on an evaluation of external market indicators. The expected rate of return on plan assets was based on historical experience and estimated future investment returns taking into consideration anticipated asset allocations, investment strategy and the views of various investment professionals.  During 2008, the plan assets declined in value by approximately $21.1 million.  The difference between this actual return and an estimated growth in the value of those assets of $22.1 million will be deferred in accumulated other elements of comprehensive income and amortized to expense over the remaining service life of the plan participants. Retirement and mortality rates were based primarily on actuarial tables that are thought to approximate our actual plan experience. In accordance with SFAS 158, actual results that differ from these assumptions are recorded in accumulated other elements of comprehensive income and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While the Company believes the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the Companys pension obligations and future expense. 
During 2007, the Company announced its intention to terminate its U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In connection with a curtailment of future benefits from these plans, effective as of December 31, 2007, and an initial settlement during 2007 of certain existing obligations of the plans relating primarily to participants who were no longer active employees at that time, the Company recorded a $35.7 million charge for the year in its 2007 consolidated results of operations. A final charge of approximately $26.2 million was recognized in 2008, in connection with the settlement of the remaining obligations of the plans, primarily to participants who were active employees of the Company during 2008.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions used in (i) the calculation of pension expense for the year ending December 31, 2009 and (ii) the calculation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO) at December 31, 2008 for the Companys most significant remaining pension plan, the United Kingdom pension plan:

Results of Operations
 
Consolidated Results  2008 Compared to 2007
 
The Companys net income for 2008 totaled $580.7 million, or $2.54 per diluted share, compared to $488.2 million, or $2.11 per diluted share in 2007.  The higher level of earnings in each of the Companys business segments, particularly in the DPS segment, was the primary driver in the 20.4% increase in earnings per share for 2008 as compared to 2007.
The results for 2008 included a final pre-tax charge of $26.2 million associated with a decision made in 2007 to terminate the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plans.   The results for 2007 included (i) an initial charge of $35.7 million for termination of the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plans referred to above and (ii) reductions in the income tax provision of $34.1 million for certain discrete items during the year, including (a) a reduction of $16.1 million based on a change in the estimated utilization of certain foreign tax credits in the United States, (b) a reduction of $5.7 million for resolution of an international contingency relating to transfer pricing, (c) a reduction of $5.5 million in an international valuation allowance based on estimated usage of certain foreign net operating loss carry forwards, (d) a reduction of $5.1 million based on a change in the estimated utilization of certain foreign tax deductions locally resulting from changes in estimated earnings internationally, (e) a reduction in deferred taxes of $1.8 million due to changes in statutory tax rates in certain international jurisdictions and (f) adjustments to other tax accruals and valuation allowances, which reduced income tax expense by $6.2 million.  These reductions were partially offset by an increase of $6.3 million in the Companys tax accruals based on changes in the estimated recoverability of certain foreign local tax benefits.
Income before income taxes in 2008 as compared to 2007 for the DPS, V&M and CS segments is discussed in more detail below.
 
Revenues
 
Revenues for 2008 totaled $5.8 billion, an increase of over $1.1 billion, or 25.3%, from $4.7 billion in 2007, reflecting strength in all major product lines during 2008 and the incremental impact of newly acquired businesses during the past year.  Over 70% of the year-over-year increase in revenues was related to the DPS segment, which was largely impacted by higher revenues in that segments drilling and subsea product lines.
During 2008, over 55% of the Companys revenue was reflected in entities with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  In translating these entities functional currency income statements to U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes, a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the applicable functional currency will result in a higher amount of U.S. dollar revenues and costs for the same amount of functional currency revenues and costs.  The net effects of a weaker U.S. dollar against these other foreign currencies did not significantly impact the Companys revenues for 2008 as compared to 2007, except in the V&M segment because during a large portion of 2008 the dollar was weak against most other foreign currencies although it strengthened significantly toward the end of the year.
A further discussion of revenues by segment may be found below. 
 
 
Cost and Expenses
 
Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for 2008 totaled $4.1 billion, an increase of $885.7 million, or 27.3%, from $3.2 billion in 2007.  As a percent of revenues, cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased from 69.5% in 2007 to 70.6% in 2008.  References to margins in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations refers to Revenues minus Cost of Sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) as shown separately on the Companys Consolidated Results of Operations statement for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008.  The increase noted above is due primarily to an approximate 1.0 percentage-point increase in the ratio due to a combination of increased volumes and a change in sales mix to more sales of equipment for major subsea projects, which typically carry lower margins as compared to the Companys other product lines, higher costs of raw materials and higher shrinkage across each of the Companys businesses, offset by reductions in subcontract costs and labor efficiencies gained from increased volumes.
Selling and administrative expenses for 2008 totaled $668.3 million as compared to $577.6 million, an increase of $90.7 million, or 15.7%.  As a percentage of revenues, selling and administrative expenses declined from 12.4% in 2007 to 11.4% in 2008.  Nearly 11% of the increase was attributable to the effects of a weaker U.S. dollar against certain other foreign currencies throughout a portion of 2008 as compared to 2007, for the same reasons mentioned above, as well as the incremental impact on costs from newly acquired businesses in the past year.  Excluding these effects, employee-related costs were up nearly $64.3 million due largely to higher headcount levels, higher employee incentives resulting from improved company-wide financial performance and higher travel costs resulting from increased activity levels.  In addition, increased non-cash stock compensation expense and a charge taken in 2008 relating to a dispute on an historical acquisition added $7.9 million of additional costs.  The remaining increase is largely attributable to higher facility costs and other economic effects.
Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $132.1 million in 2008, an increase of $22.3 million, or 20.3%, from $109.8 million in 2007.  Depreciation expense increased $17.3 million year-over-year as a result of increased capital spending, primarily for new machinery and equipment.  Amortization expense increased $5.0 million primarily due to higher capital spending on the Companys enterprise-wide information technology assets and due to additional amortization of certain other acquired intangible assets.
Interest income declined by $3.4 million, or 11.0%, from $30.7 million in 2007 to $27.3 million in 2008 due primarily to lower short-term interest rates during 2008 as compared to 2007.
Interest expense totaled $70.3 million in 2008 as compared to $43.8 million in 2007, an increase of $26.5 million.  The increase is primarily due to $26.2 million of additional interest associated with the issuance of $450.0 million of 6.375% senior notes and $300.0 million of 7.0% senior notes in June 2008.

During 2007, the Company announced its intention to terminate its U.S. defined benefit pension plans, effective as of December 31, 2007.  In connection with the plans curtailment and the settlement during 2007 of a portion of the existing plan obligations associated with participants who were no longer active employees of the Company at that time, an initial settlement charge of $35.7 million was taken during the year ended December 31, 2007.   A final settlement charge of $26.2 million was taken during the year ended December 31, 2008 associated with the settlement of all remaining plan obligations associated with participants who were active employees of the Company during 2008 and any others who were not covered by the initial settlement of plan obligations made in 2007.  Following settlement of the plan obligations described above, approximately $5.3 million of excess defined benefit pension plan assets remained available for use by the Company in meeting its future matching contribution funding obligations under the Cameron International Corporation Retirement Savings Plan, a separate defined contribution 401(k) plan.
The income tax provision for 2008 was $270.7 million compared to $199.8 million in 2007.  The effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 were 31.8% and 29.0%, respectively.   The tax provision for 2007 was reduced for certain discrete items totaling $34.1 million as described previously.  Absent these items, the effective tax rate for 2007 would have been 34.0%.  The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2008 as compared to 2007, absent the discrete items, was due primarily to an increase in the amount of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions in 2008 as compared to 2007.
 
Segment Results
 2008 Compared to 2007
 
Information relating to results by segment may be found in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
DPS Segment
 
DPS segment revenues for 2008 totaled $3.7 billion, an increase of $849.6 million, or 29.4%, compared to $2.9 billion in 2007.  A 43% increase in subsea equipment sales and a 35% increase in drilling equipment sales accounted for nearly three-fourths of the segments revenue increase for 2008 as compared to 2007.  The increase in subsea equipment sales was due mainly to increased shipments and activity levels for large projects offshore West Africa, Egypt, Eastern Canada, Western Australia and in the Gulf of Mexico.  Nearly two-thirds of the increase in drilling equipment sales was for major deepwater rig construction projects with the remaining increase largely attributable to higher demand for blowout preventers (BOPs) and related equipment for land and jack-up rigs and the impact of newly acquired businesses.  In addition, surface equipment sales were up over 15% primarily as a result of higher demand for new equipment in North America, the Middle East and Indonesia due to higher activity levels for most of 2008 as compared to 2007, as well as higher sales of aftermarket parts and services in all regions and the impact of newly acquired businesses.  This was partially offset by a decline in demand for new surface equipment from customers in Latin America.  Sales of oil, gas and water separation applications were up nearly 31% as various large projects awarded in 2007 were completed or nearing completion as of December 31, 2008.
Income before income taxes for 2008 totaled $639.9 million as compared to $498.8 million in 2007, an increase of $141.1 million, or 28.3%.  Cost of sales as a percent of revenues increased from 71.8% in 2007 to 72.6% in 2008.  The increase was due to a 0.8 percentage-point increase in the ratio, mainly from increased volumes and a change in sales mix to more sales of equipment for major subsea projects, which typically carry lower margins as compared to the segments base business, partially offset by the impact of an increase in sales of lower cost drilling equipment.
Selling and administrative costs for 2008 totaled $312.6 million, an increase of $51.9 million, or 19.9%, from $260.7 million in 2007.  Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues declined from 9.0% in 2007 to 8.4% in 2008.  Over 60% of the increase was attributable to higher employee-related costs due mainly to higher headcount levels, as well as increased incentive and travel costs and the impact of newly acquired businesses, with the remainder due largely to higher support costs relating to expansion of the segments global business operations.
Depreciation and amortization expense for 2008 was $70.5 million, an increase of $14.6 million, or 26.2%, from $55.9 million in 2007.  Depreciation expense increased $12.7 million due mainly to higher levels of capital spending in recent periods for new machinery and equipment.  Amortization expense was up $1.9 million from 2007 primarily associated with the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets.
 
V&M Segment
 
V&M segment revenues totaled $1.5 billion for 2008, an increase of $199.5 million, or 15.7%, from $1.3 billion in 2007.  Approximately 20% of the increase was attributable to the effects of a weaker U.S. dollar throughout a portion of 2008 as compared to 2007 and the incremental impact of new product line acquisitions during the past year.  Excluding these effects, nearly 40% of the segments revenue growth was the result of a 12% increase in sales of engineered valves in 2008 as compared to 2007, resulting mainly from higher levels of international pipeline construction project activity.  Sales of process valves increased 15% year-over-year as a result of higher demand for equipment for use in gas processing, refinery and product storage applications.  Higher rig count and activity levels throughout much of 2008 in the United States and Canada contributed to a 12% increase in demand for distributed valves and an 8% increase in sales of aftermarket parts and services.  Sales of measurement products increased 27% in 2008 as compared to 2007, nearly 40% of which was due to the incremental impact of new product line acquisitions during the year, with the remainder due largely to an increase in market activity in the United States and higher demand for equipment to be  used in nuclear applications.
 
30
 
Income before income taxes totaled $301.4 million in 2008, an increase of $33.4 million, or 12.5%, from $268.0 million in 2007.  Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased from 64.2% in 2007 to 65.7% in 2008.  The increase in this ratio was due primarily to (i) an increase in the cost of raw materials, freight, labor and manufacturing overhead that was not fully offset by higher pricing (approximately a 1.1 percentage-point increase) and (ii) an increase in the ratio of certain indirect production costs in relation to revenues, primarily relating to higher headcount levels and higher overhead costs associated with expansion of the segments business (approximately a 0.6 percentage-point increase).
Selling and administrative expenses for 2008 totaled $171.4 million as compared to $157.3 million in 2007, an increase of $14.1 million, or 9.0%.  Over one-third of the increase was attributable to the effects of a weaker U.S. dollar throughout a portion of 2008 as compared to 2007 and the incremental impact of new product line acquisitions during the past year.  Excluding these effects, over 90% of the remaining increase was attributable to higher employee-related costs, particularly in the selling and marketing function, that were mainly associated with higher headcount levels needed to support expansion of the segments business.
Depreciation and amortization in the V&M segment increased $2.2 million, or 7.2%, from $30.0 million in 2007 to $32.2 million in 2008 primarily as a result of increased capital spending for new machinery and equipment in recent periods. 
 
CS Segment
 
 
   
 CS segment revenues for 2008 totaled $638.9 million, an increase of $133.3 million, or 26.4%, from $505.6 million in 2007.  Two-thirds of the segment increase was attributable to a 37% increase in sales of centrifugal compression equipment, while sales of reciprocating equipment also increased more than 15%.  Within the centrifugal compression equipment product line, shipments of engineered units designed primarily to meet air separation, gas and engineered air requirements increased 42% with sales of new plant air equipment and aftermarket parts and services both up more than 30% from the prior year as a result of higher demand across all product lines by the segments industrial customer base.  Over one-half of the increase in the reciprocating product line was due to a 39% increase in sales of Ajax units primarily to customers in China, Russia, Mexico and to packagers in the United States.  In addition, shipments of Superior Compressors increased 12% primarily due to demand from packagers in the United States and sales of aftermarket parts and services were up 9% largely due to increased parts availability allowing for a reduction in beginning of the year backlog levels.
    Income before income taxes for the CS segment totaled $102.0 million in 2008, an increase of $25.5 million, or 33.4%, from $76.5 million in 2007.  Cost of sales as a percent of revenues declined from 69.3% in 2007 to 68.9% in 2008.  The improvement was primarily due to a decrease of 0.3 percentage points in the ratio resulting from lower costs associated with transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the segments legal entities.  The segment also benefitted from a mix shift to a higher amount of sales of higher-margin centrifugal compression equipment during the year and improved pricing within the centrifugal compression equipment product line.
    Selling and administrative expenses for 2008 totaled $81.2 million, an increase of $16.3 million, or 25.0%, from $64.9 million in 2007.  Over 80% of the increase was due to higher employee-related costs largely attributable to higher headcount and increased employee incentive costs.
    Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $15.3 million in 2008 compared to $13.7 million in 2007, an increase of $1.6 million, or 11.6%.  Higher levels of capital spending in recent periods accounted for the majority of the increase.
Corporate Segment
The Corporate segments loss before income taxes for 2008 totaled $191.9 million, an increase of $36.6 million from $155.3 million in 2007.  The primary factors causing the increase were (i) higher interest expense of $26.5 million and (ii) higher selling and administrative expenses of $8.4 million.  An increase of $3.9 million in foreign currency losses, increased depreciation and amortization of $3.9 million and a decline in interest income of $3.4 million were mostly offset by a decline of $9.5 million in the 2008 charge for the final settlement of the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plans as compared to the initial settlement charge recorded in 2007.
Included in the Corporate segment were increased foreign currency losses, as compared to the prior year, of $3.9 million, primarily related to intercompany loans the Company had with various foreign subsidiaries that were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
 
31
 
Selling and administrative expenses in 2008 totaled $103.1 million, an increase of $8.4 million, from $94.7 million in 2007.  The increase is due primarily to (i) higher employee incentive costs of $4.1 million mostly related to increased 2008 company-wide financial performance, (ii) higher noncash stock compensation expense of $4.2 million and (iii) a $3.6 million charge taken in 2008 related to a dispute on an historical acquisition.  These increases were partially offset by a decline of approximately $3.0 million in legal costs associated with compliance-related activities.   Additionally, during 2008, the Company recorded a $5.8 million reduction in expense relating to one of its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.  A similar reduction in expense was recorded in 2007 relating to another of the Companys non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
Depreciation and amortization increased by $3.9 million from $10.2 million in 2007 to $14.1 million in 2008 primarily due to higher amortization expense associated with the Companys capitalized enterprise-wide software systems as well as additional amortization of certain intangible assets relating to intellectual property.
The decreases in interest income and the charge for terminating the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plan as well as the increase in interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007 are discussed in Consolidated Results  2008 Compared to 2007 above. 
 
Consolidated Results  2007 Compared to 2006
 
The Companys net income for 2007 totaled $488.2 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, compared to $309.0 million, or $1.32 per diluted share in 2006. The results for 2007 included (i) a pre-tax charge of $35.7 million associated with a decision to terminate the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plans made in 2007 and (ii) reductions in the income tax provision of $34.1 million for certain discrete items during the year, including (a) a reduction of $16.1 million based on a change in the estimated utilization of certain foreign tax credits in the United States, (b) a reduction of $5.7 million for resolution of an international contingency relating to transfer pricing, (c) a reduction of $5.5 million in an international valuation allowance based on estimated usage of certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards, (d) a reduction of $5.1 million based on a change in the estimated utilization of certain foreign tax deductions locally resulting from changes in estimated earnings internationally, (e) a reduction in deferred taxes of $1.8 million due to changes in statutory tax rates in certain international jurisdictions and (f) adjustments to other tax accruals and valuation allowances, which reduced income tax expense by $6.2 million. These reductions were partially offset by an increase of $6.3 million in the Companys tax accruals based on changes in the estimated recoverability of certain foreign local tax benefits. The results for 2006 included pre-tax charges of $29.6 million for acquisition integration activities associated with the operations of the Flow Control segment of Dresser, Inc. that were acquired in late 2005 and early 2006 (the Dresser Acquired Businesses).
Additionally, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $17.5 million in 2006 for the anticipated cost of the settlement of a class action lawsuit related to contaminated underground water near a former manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. These charges were partially offset by a pre-tax foreign currency gain in the second quarter of 2006 of $10.0 million, primarily relating to short-term intercompany loans made to the Companys European subsidiaries in connection with the acquisition of the Dresser Acquired Businesses.
 
Revenues
 
Revenues for 2007 totaled $4.7 billion, an increase of $923.5 million, or 24.7%, from $3.7 billion during 2006. Excluding the effects of a weaker U.S. dollar against most other major world currencies and the impact of recent acquisitions, revenues were up approximately 21.3% with the DPS segment accounting for nearly 87% of the remaining increase. The V&M and CS segments also showed year-over-year improvements in revenues, although at more modest levels than in DPS, which benefited from current-year shipments relating to the high level of drilling orders received in 2006 for new rig construction projects as well as higher demand, mainly from international customers, for the segments surface and subsea product offerings. A further discussion of revenue by segment may be found below.
 
Cost and Expenses
 
Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for 2007 totaled $3.2 billion, an increase of $641.2 million, or 24.7%, from $2.6 billion for 2006. As a percent of revenues, cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was flat at 69.5% for both years. Although the ratio of cost of sales to revenues was flat year-over-year, there was a decrease in the ratio of cost of sales-to-revenues for the Companys products during 2007 resulting from (i) improved pricing and cost controls at V&M and CS, the effect of which was mostly offset by the impact of shipments of major drilling and subsea projects at DPS, which carry a higher cost of sales-to-revenue ratio than the segments base drilling and subsea businesses (approximately a 0.2 percentage-point decrease) and (ii) the application of relatively fixed manufacturing overhead to a larger revenue base (approximately a 0.3 percentage-point decrease). Offsetting these improvements was (i) the absence in 2007 of LIFO income totaling $2.1 million recognized in 2006 in relation to a decrease in inventory levels that year in the CS segment (approximately a 0.1 percentage-point increase) and (ii) the absence of foreign currency gains recognized in 2006, net of foreign currency losses recognized in 2007, totaling $14.8 million, which  primarily related to intercompany loans the Company has with various foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (approximately a 0.4 percentage-point increase). 
Selling and administrative expenses for 2007 were $577.6 million as compared to $528.6 million in 2006, an increase of $49.0 million, or 9.3%. The increase is due primarily to (i) higher salary, benefit, travel and other employee-related costs of approximately $51.6 million resulting mainly from headcount increases and higher activity levels, (ii) higher non-cash stock compensation costs totaling $5.8 million, (iii) $9.7 million of higher legal and professional services primarily relating to litigation and compliance-related activities, (iv) $2.8 million relating to newly acquired businesses and (v) $1.1 million for plant consolidation and restructuring costs in the CS segment. Offsetting these increases was (i) a $5.8 million one-time reduction in pension expense relating to one of the Companys non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and (ii) the absence in 2007 of a 2006 provision of $17.5 million for the estimated cost of settlement of a class action lawsuit related to environmental contamination near a former manufacturing facility. 
 
 
 
 
32
 
Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $109.8 million for 2007, an increase of $8.4 million from $101.4 million in 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to the higher level of capital spending in recent periods for machinery and equipment and the Companys enterprise-wide technology assets. 
Interest income for 2007 was $30.7 million as compared to $26.9 million in 2006, an increase of $3.8 million. The increase is primarily attributable to higher invested cash balances for 2007 as compared to 2006. 
Interest expense incurred during 2007 totaled $43.8 million, an increase of $8.8 million from $35.0 million for 2006. The increase is primarily due to the full-year impact in 2007 of interest on $500.0 million of 2.5% debentures issued in May 2006, which amounted to an approximate $11.4 million increase in interest expense in 2007. This increase was partially offset by the repayment of $200.0 million of 2.65% senior notes in April 2007, which lowered interest expense by approximately $3.1 million during 2007 as compared to 2006. 
During 2007, the Company announced its intention to terminate its U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In connection with a curtailment of future benefits from these plans, effective as of December 31, 2007, and a settlement during 2007 of certain existing obligations of the plans, the Company recorded a $35.7 million charge for the year. Further information relating to termination of the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plans may be found in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
During 2006, acquisition integration costs totaling $29.6 million were incurred in connection with the integration of the Dresser Acquired Businesses primarily into the operations of the V&M segment. Approximately $10.5 million of the costs related to non-cash asset impairment charges and $4.2 million related to employee severance at a legacy facility that was closed as a result of the acquisition. The remaining costs were for employee stay bonuses, employee relocation, plant rearrangement, plant and facility consolidation and other integration costs.
The income tax provision for 2007 was $199.8 million compared to $165.3 million in 2006. The effective tax rates for 2007 and 2006 were 29.0% and 34.8%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 2007 was primarily attributable to adjustments during the year totaling $34.1 million, as described above, and an increased amount of full-year income in lower tax rate jurisdictions.
 
Segment Results  2007 Compared to 2006
 
Information relating to results by segment may be found in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
DPS Segment
 
 
 
DPS segment revenues for 2007 totaled $2.9 billion, an increase of $774.0 million, or 36.6%, compared to $2.1 billion in 2006. Sales of drilling equipment increased approximately 97%, surface sales were up over 28% and subsea equipment sales increased approximately 23% while sales of oil, gas and water separation applications were down by nearly 7%. Nearly two-thirds of the increase in drilling sales was attributable to the higher level of new major rig construction projects with the remainder due to increased shipments of blowout preventers (BOPs) for land and jack-up rigs and higher sales of aftermarket parts and services. Nearly 14% of the growth in sales of surface equipment was the result of the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar in relation to other major world currencies during 2007 in comparison to 2006, with nearly 60% of the remaining increase due largely to strong demand from customers in the European, African and Caspian Sea regions. Other major regions of the world, except Canada, also showed higher activity levels and demand for surface equipment during 2007. Nearly one-fifth of the increase in subsea equipment sales in 2007 was due to the effects of a weaker U.S. dollar with the remaining increase due mainly to shipments for large projects offshore West Africa. Excluding the effects of a weaker U.S. dollar, sales of oil, gas and water separation applications declined nearly 11% due primarily to the absence in 2007 of revenues recognized in 2006 associated with an oil separation application to be used on a floating offshore storage platform offshore Brazil. This impact was partially offset by higher activity levels in 2007 for water treatment projects. 
Income before income taxes for 2007 totaled $498.8 million as compared to $364.7 million in 2006, an increase of $134.1 million, or 36.8%, which was in line with the increase in revenues as discussed above. Cost of sales as a percent of revenues increased from 70.0% in 2006 to 71.8% in 2007. The increase was due primarily to (i) an increase in the ratio of cost of sales to revenues for the segments products, due largely to higher shipments of major drilling and subsea projects, which carry a higher cost of sales-to-revenue ratio than the segments base drilling and subsea businesses (approximately a 1.7 percentage-point increase), (ii) higher subcontract costs, mainly at international locations (a 0.2 percentage-point increase) and (iii) an increase in warranty costs in 2007 compared to 2006 (a 0.3 percentage-point increase). These increases were partially offset by a change order agreed to with one of the Companys major subsea customers in late 2007 (a 0.4 percentage-point decrease).
Selling and administrative costs for 2007 totaled $260.7 million, an increase of $44.7 million, or 20.7%, from $216.0 million in 2006. Increased headcount levels, including the associated salary, benefit, travel and other personnel-related costs accounted for over three-fourths of the increase with the remainder due primarily to higher facility costs and activity levels needed to support the expansion of the Companys business.

Note 1: Summary of Major Accounting Policies
Retrospective revision of consolidated financial statements  
:
Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted FASB Staff Position APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP APB 14-1), which clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (including partial cash settlement) upon conversion.  FSP APB 14-1 requires issuers of convertible debt instruments within its scope to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instruments in a manner that reflects the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized.  FSP APB 14-1 requires bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in the issuers consolidated results of operations.  FSP APB 14-1 is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2009 and early adoption was not permitted.  However, once adopted, FSP 14-1 requires retrospective application to the terms of instruments within its scope as they existed for all periods presented.  The Company has chosen to apply this new standard to its existing 1.5% convertible debentures issued in 2004 and due in 2024 (1.5% Convertible Debentures) and its 2.5% convertible debentures issued in 2006 and due in 2026 (2.5% Convertible Debentures).  These debentures, totaling in aggregate $631,000,000 of face value at December 31, 2008, were outstanding during the three year period ended December 31, 2008, as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  The bifurcation of the assumed liability portion of the debt and the assumed portion of the debt representing the conversion option was based on estimated market borrowing rates of 4.85% and 5.9%, respectively, for debt instruments similar to the 1.5% and 2.5% Convertible Debentures, excluding the conversion options in those debentures.  The discount assigned to the convertible debentures in order to result in interest expense equal to the nonconvertible debt borrowing rates mentioned above is being accreted to interest expense over an estimated five-year life of the convertible debentures.  The estimated life is consistent with an option in the debentures allowing holders to require the Company to repurchase the debentures in whole or in part for principal plus accrued and unpaid interest five years following the date of issuance.  Accordingly, as a result of the adoption of FSP APB 14-1, the Company has retrospectively revised certain amounts included in these financial statements as of December 31, 2008 and 2007
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 as follows
and for
 
 
In
addition, capital in excess of par value as of January 1, 2007 was increased by $66,516,000 and retained earnings as of January 1, 2007 was decreased by $15,129,000 as a result of the adoption of FSP APB 14-1.  Various supporting amounts included in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows and these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements have also been retrospectively revised in connection with the changes noted above.  No other changes from the amounts or disclosures originally reflected in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2009, have been included in these consolidated financial statements.
 Cameron International Corporation (Cameron or the Company) is a leading provider of flow equipment products, systems and services to worldwide oil, gas and process industries. Products include oil and gas pressure control and separation equipment, including valves, wellheads, controls, chokes, blowout preventers and assembled systems for oil and gas drilling, production and transmission processes used in onshore, offshore and subsea applications. Cameron also manufactures and services air and gas compressors and turbochargers. 
   Company Operations
The Companys operations are organized into three business segments  Drilling and Production Systems (DPS), Valves & Measurement (V&M) and Compression Systems (CS). Additional information regarding each segment may be found in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments from 20% to 50% in affiliated companies are accounted for using the equity method.
Princi
ples of Consolidation
 The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, estimates of total contract profit or loss on certain long-term production contracts, estimated losses on accounts receivable, estimated realizable value on excess and obsolete inventory, contingencies, including tax contingencies, estimated liabilities for litigation exposures and liquidated damages, estimated warranty costs, estimates related to pension accounting, estimates related to the fair value of reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment, estimated proceeds from assets held for sale and estimates related to deferred tax assets and liabilities, including valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 
Estimates in Financial St
atements
 The Company generally recognizes revenue once the following four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery of the equipment has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the price of the equipment or service is fixed and determinable and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. For certain engineering, procurement and construction-type contracts, which typically include the Companys subsea and drilling systems and processing equipment contracts, revenue is recognized in accordance with Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts (SOP 81-1). Under SOP 81-1, the Company recognizes revenue on these contracts using a units-of-completion method. Under the units-of-completion method, revenue is recognized once the manufacturing process is complete for each unit specified in the contract with the customer, including customer inspection and acceptance, if required by the contract.  This method requires the Company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project, which impacts the amount of gross margin the Company recognizes in each reporting period.  The Company routinely, and at least quarterly, reviews its estimates relating to total estimated contract profit or loss and recognizes changes in those estimates as they are determined.  Revenue associated with change orders is not included in the calculation of estimated profit on a contract until approved by the customer.  Costs associated with unapproved change orders are deferred if (i) the customer acknowledges a change has occurred and (ii) it is probable that the costs will be recoverable from the customer.  If these two conditions are not met, the costs are included in the calculation of estimated profit on the project.  Anticipated losses on contracts accounted for under SOP 81-1 are recorded in full in the period in which they become evident.
Revenue Recognition
Factors that
may affect future project costs and margins include the ability to properly execute the engineering and design phases consistent with our customers expectations, production efficiencies, and availability and costs of labor, materials and subcomponents.  These factors can significantly impact the accuracy of the Companys estimates and materially impact the Companys future period earnings.  Approximately 28%, 21% and 17% of the Company's revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, was recognized under SOP 81-1.
 Shipping and handling costs are reflected in the caption entitled Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below) in the accompanying Consolidated Results of Operations statements. 
Shipping and Handling Costs
  The Company considers all investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
Cash Equivalents
 Investments in available-for-sale marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value, based on quoted market prices. Differences between cost and fair value are reflected as a component of accumulated other elements of comprehensive income until such time as those differences are realized. The basis for computing realized gains or losses is the specific identification method. If the Company determines that a loss is other than temporary, such loss will be charged to earnings. No material realized gains or losses on short-term investments were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. 
Short-term Investments
  The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Such allowances are based upon several factors including, but not limited to, historical experience, the length of time an invoice has been outstanding, responses from customers relating to demands for payment and the current and projected financial condition of specific customers. 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
 Aggregate inventories are carried at cost or, if lower, net realizable value. On the basis of current costs, 55% of inventories at December 31, 2008 and 50% at December 31, 2007 are carried on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. For these locations, the use of LIFO results in a better matching of costs and revenues. The remaining inventories, which are located outside the United States and Canada, are carried on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company provides a reserve for estimated inventory obsolescence or excess quantities on hand equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value. During 2006, the Company reduced its LIFO inventory levels in the CS segment resulting in a liquidation of certain low-cost inventory layers. Accordingly, the Company recorded non-cash LIFO income of $2,091,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006. 
Inventories

 Property, plant and equipment, both owned and under capital lease, is carried at cost. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. The cost of renewals, replacements and betterments is capitalized. The Company capitalizes software developed or obtained for internal use. Accordingly, the cost of third-party software, as well as the cost of third-party and internal personnel that are directly involved in application development activities, are capitalized during the application development phase of new software systems projects. Costs during the preliminary project stage and post-implementation stage of new software systems projects, including data conversion and training costs, are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, or in the case of assets under capital leases, over the related lease term, if less, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of the major classes of property, plant and equipment are as follows:
Plant and Equipment
  In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS142), the Company reviews goodwill at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level, or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present. Generally, this review is conducted during the first quarter of each annual period.  Due to the significant decline in the Companys stock price during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the large drop in oil and gas prices, an updated analysis was conducted as of the end of 2008.  In conducting this review, the Company compared the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its respective book value. The estimated fair value for the 2008, 2007 and 2006 evaluations was determined using discounted cash flows or other market-related valuation models. Certain estimates and judgments are required in the application of the fair value models. Each of the evaluations indicated that no impairment of goodwill was required. The Companys reporting units for SFAS 142 purposes are the Drilling, Surface, Subsea and Petreco Process Systems product lines of the DPS segment, the Engineered Valves, Distributed Valves, Process Valves, Measurement Systems product lines and the Aftermarket Services business of the V&M segment and the Reciprocating and Centrifugal Compression product lines of the CS segment. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys business segments. 
Goodwill
 The Companys intangible assets, excluding goodwill, represent purchased patents, trademarks, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets. The majority of other identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the years expected to be benefited, generally ranging from 5 to 20 years. Such intangibles are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. As many areas of the Companys business rely on patents and proprietary technology, it has followed a policy of seeking patent protection both inside and outside the United States for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. The costs of developing any intangibles internally, as well as costs of defending such intangibles, are expensed as incurred. No material impairment of intangible assets was required as of December 31, 2008, 2007 or 2006.
Intangible Assets
  In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144), long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, to be held and used by the Company are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company bases its evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets, the future economic benefit of the assets, any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present. If such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the Company determines whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flow analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. If an impairment has occurred, the Company recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. Assets are classified as held for sale when the Company has a plan for disposal of such assets and those assets meet the held for sale criteria contained in SFAS 144 and are stated at estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.  No material impairment of long-lived assets was required as of December 31, 2008, 2007 or 2006.
Long-Lived Assets
 Estimated warranty costs are accrued either at the time of sale based upon historical experience or, in some cases, when specific warranty problems are encountered. Adjustments to the recorded liability are made periodically to reflect actual experience. 
Product Warranty
  The Company accrues for costs relating to litigation, including litigation defense costs, claims and other contingent matters, including liquidated damage liabilities, when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable. Such estimates may be based on advice from third parties or on managements judgment, as appropriate. Revisions to contingent liability reserves are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect the Companys previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss. Amounts paid upon the ultimate resolution of contingent liabilities may be materially different from previous estimates and could require adjustments to the estimated reserves to be recognized in the period such new information becomes known. 
Contingencies
 
53
 
 The asset and liability approach is used to account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Income tax expense includes U.S. and foreign income taxes, including U.S. federal taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are planned to be remitted. Taxes are not provided on the translation component of comprehensive income since the effect of translation is not considered to modify the amount of the earnings that are planned to be remitted. 
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for uncertainties in its income tax positions under the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.  Interest related to an underpayment of income taxes is reflected as a component of interest expense in the Consolidated Results of Operations statement. Penalties on a tax position taken by the Company are reflected as a component of income tax expense in the Consolidated Results of Operations statement. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys income taxes.
  Environmental remediation and postremediation monitoring costs are accrued when such obligations become probable and reasonably estimable. Such future expenditures are not discounted to their present value. 
Environmental Remediation
 and Compliance
 The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158) with regard to recognition of the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The measurement date for all of the Companys plans accounted for under SFAS 158 was December 31, 2008. SFAS 158 did not change the basic approach used by companies to measure plan assets, benefit obligations and annual net periodic benefit costs. These issues are expected to be addressed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) at a later date. Accordingly, the Company continues to follow the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS 106) in measuring its plan assets and benefit obligations as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 and in determining the amount of its net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. 
Pension and Postretirement Be
nefits Accounting
 At December 31, 2008, the Company had four stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described in further detail in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2006, compensation expense for the Companys stock-based compensation plans is measured using the fair value method required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)). Under SFAS 123(R), the fair value of stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards is amortized to expense using the straight-line method over the shorter of the vesting period or the remaining employee service period. 
Stock-Based Compensation
 The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments as assets and liabilities on a gross basis and measures them at fair value. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), hedge accounting is only applied when the derivative is deemed highly effective at offsetting changes in anticipated cash flows of the hedged item or transaction. Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other elements of comprehensive income until the underlying transactions are recognized in earnings, at which time any deferred hedging gains or losses are also recorded in earnings on the same line as the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative used as a cash flow hedge is recorded in earnings as incurred. The amounts recorded in earnings from ineffectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 have not been material. The Company may at times also use forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. These contracts are not designated as hedges under SFAS 133. Therefore, the changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized in earnings as they occur and offset gains or losses on the related asset or liability. 
Derivative Financial Instruments
  For most subsidiaries and branches outside the U.S., the local currency is the functional currency. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, the financial statements of these subsidiaries and branches are translated into U.S. dollars as follows: (i) assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates; (ii) income, expenses and cash flows at average exchange rates; and (iii) stockholders equity at historical exchange rates. For those subsidiaries for which the local currency is the functional currency, the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated other elements of comprehensive income in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Foreign Currency
For certain other subsidiaries and branches, operations are conducted primarily in currencies other than the local currencies, which are therefore the functional currency. Non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Revenue, expense and gain and loss accounts of these foreign subsidiaries and branches are remeasured at average exchange rates. Non-functional currency non-monetary assets and liabilities, and the related revenue, expense, gain and loss accounts are remeasured at historical rates. 
Foreign currency gains and losses arising from monetary transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in income. The effects of foreign currency transactions were a loss of $321,000 and $360,000 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and a gain of $14,414,000 for the year ended December 31, 2006.
  
Rece
ntly Issued Accounting Pronouncements
 
In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 132(R)-1 (FSP FAS 132(R)-1) that provides additional disclosure requirements for postretirement benefit plan assets. Once the Company adopts this FSP prospectively on December 31, 2009, the Company will be required to disclose how investment allocation decisions are made, the major categories of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value of the plans assets, the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period, and significant concentrations of risk within the plan assets. The Company will provide the required level of disclosures regarding postretirement benefit plan assets for its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans following adoption on December 31, 2009.
 
54
 
In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires entities to provide greater transparency about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company will provide the level of required disclosures regarding its use of derivative instruments upon adoption of this new standard, effective January 1, 2009.
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141R, Business Combinations (SFAS 141R) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Accounting and Reporting of Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). These two standards must be adopted in conjunction with each other on a prospective basis. The most significant changes to business combination accounting pursuant to SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 are the following: (a) recognize, with certain exceptions, 100 percent of the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in acquisitions of less than a 100 percent controlling interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity, (b) acquirers shares issued in consideration for a business combination will be measured at fair value on the closing date, not the announcement date, (c) recognize contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair values, with subsequent changes in fair value generally reflected in earnings, (d) the expensing of all transaction costs as incurred and most restructuring costs, (e) recognition of pre-acquisition loss and gain contingencies at their acquisition date fair values, with certain exceptions, (f) capitalization of acquired in-process research and development rather than expense recognition and (g) recognize changes that result from a business combination transaction in an acquirers existing income tax valuation allowances and tax uncertainty accruals as adjustments to income tax expense. The Company anticipates these new standards will significantly affect the Companys accounting for future business combinations following adoption on January 1, 2009.
In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 provides entities with an option to measure many financial assets and liabilities and certain other items at fair value as determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. SFAS 159 became effective for the Company as of January 1, 2008; however, the Company did not elect to measure any additional financial instruments at fair value as a result of adopting SFAS 159. Therefore, there was no impact on the Companys financial statements at the time of adoption.
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the level of disclosures regarding fair value. SFAS 157 also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement rather than an entity-specific measurement. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 relating to financial assets and liabilities and other assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis effective on January 1, 2008, as required.  As allowed by FASB Staff Position FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, the Company elected to defer the adoption of SFAS 157 with respect to all remaining nonfinancial assets and liabilities until January 1, 2009.  There was no material impact on the Companys financial statements at the time of adoption; however, the Company does expect that this new standard will impact certain aspects of its accounting for business combinations on a prospective basis, including the determination of fair values assigned to certain purchased assets and liabilities.

Note 2: Acquisitions
During 2008, the Company acquired the assets or capital stock of seven businesses for a total cash purchase price of $191,681,000.  In addition, the Company may be required to pay up to approximately $3,000,000 in each of the next two years as additional contingent purchase price for one of the businesses acquired depending on the level of annual financial performance achieved by that business during the next two year period.  These businesses were acquired to enhance the Companys product offerings and to strengthen the Companys ability to deliver a broader range of solutions to its customers in the DPS segments drilling, surface and flow control businesses and in the V&M segments measurement business.  Preliminary goodwill recorded as a result of these acquisitions totaled approximately $119,330,000 at December 31, 2008, approximately 79% of which will be deductible for income tax purposes.  Additionally, preliminary identified intangible assets totaling approximately $44,529,000 were also recorded as of December 31, 2008.  The Company is still awaiting significant information relating to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of certain of the acquired businesses in order to finalize the purchase price allocations.
During 2007, the Company acquired the assets or capital stock of four businesses for a total cash purchase price of $76,386,000.  These businesses were bought to enhance the Companys product offerings in its subsea and oil, gas and water separation applications product lines in the DPS segment and in the measurement and aftermarket businesses of the V&M segment.  Total goodwill recorded from these acquisitions was approximately $35,590,000.  Adjustments to goodwill totaling nearly $24,140,000 were recorded during 2008 upon the finalization of the purchase price allocations from the prior year acquisitions based on receipt of information in 2008 relating to the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and for the recording of certain tax contingencies in connection with the acquired businesses.

Note 7: Employee Benefit Plans
As of December 31, 2008, the Company sponsored separate defined benefit pension plans for employees of its United Kingdom (U.K.) and German subsidiaries as well as several unfunded defined benefit arrangements for various other employee groups. The U.K. defined benefit pension plan was frozen to new entrants effective June 14, 1996. 
 
57
 
In June 2007, the Company notified employees and beneficiaries that it had elected to terminate the Cameron International Corporation Retirement Plan (Retirement Plan) as well as certain related unfunded supplemental plans, which covered the majority of salaried U.S. employees and certain domestic hourly employees at the time the Retirement Plan was frozen to new entrants, effective May 1, 2003.  In addition, the Company curtailed future benefits from being earned under the Retirement Plan, effective December 31, 2007.  The Company distributed the assets of the Retirement Plan in two phases.  The first phase occurred during the fourth quarter of 2007 and included former employees who were participants in the Retirement Plan.  In connection with this initial distribution of plan assets and the curtailment of future benefits from the Retirement Plan, the Company recorded a pre-tax settlement loss of $37,704,000 and a pre-tax curtailment gain of $1,979,000, for a net charge in 2007 of $35,725,000.  During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded an additional settlement loss of $26,196,000 in connection with the final distribution of plan assets to current employees who were participants in the Retirement Plan and any others not covered by the initial distribution of plan assets during 2007.  At December 31, 2008, approximately $5,328,000 of excess plan assets remained following settlement of all remaining plan obligations.  These assets are available for use by the Company in meeting its cash funding obligations for matching contributions under the Cameron International Corporation Retirement Savings Plan, a defined contribution 401(k) plan for its eligible United States-based employees.
Certain of the Companys employees also participate in various domestic employee welfare benefit plans, including medical, dental and prescriptions. Additionally, certain employees receive retiree medical, prescription and life insurance benefits. All of the welfare benefit plans, including those providing postretirement benefits, are unfunded.
    Total net benefit plan expense (income) associated with the Companys defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans consisted of the following:
Included in accumulated other elements of comprehensive income at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic benefit plan cost, as well as the amounts that are expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit plan cost during the year ending December 31, 2009:
 
58
 
    The change in the projected benefit obligation associated with the Companys defined benefit pension plans and the change in the accumulated benefit obligation associated with the Companys postretirement benefit plans is as follows:
 
 
The total accumulated benefit obligation for the Companys defined benefit pension plans was $194,813,000 and $350,849,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
The change in the plan assets associated with the Companys defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is as follows:
 
 
The funded status of the Companys defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is as follows:
 
59
 
Actual asset investment allocations for the Companys main defined benefit pension plans in the United States and the United Kingdom, which account for approximately 89% of total plan assets, are as follows:
 
In each jurisdiction, the investment of plan assets is overseen by a plan asset committee whose members act as trustees of the plan and set investment policy. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the investment strategy has been designed to approximate the performance of market indexes. The asset allocations for the U.S. plan at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were heavily weighted towards fixed income debt securities, cash and other short-term investments due to the plan termination announced during 2007 as discussed above. The Company has modified its targeted allocation for the U.K. Plan for 2009 and beyond to be approximately 54% in equities, 40% in fixed income debt securities and 6% in real estate and other.
    During 2008, the Company made contributions totaling $12,225,000 to the assets of its various defined benefit pension plans. Contributions to plan assets for 2009 are currently expected to approximate $40,000,000, assuming no change in the current discount rate or expected investment earnings.
The weighted-average assumptions associated with the Companys defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans were as follows:
The Companys discount rate assumptions for its U.S. postretirement benefits plan and its U.K. defined benefit pension plan are based on the average yield of a hypothetical high quality bond portfolio with maturities that approximately match the estimated cash flow needs of the plans. 
The assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on assets are based on historical experience and estimated future investment returns, taking into consideration anticipated asset allocations, investment strategies and the views of various investment professionals. 
The rate of compensation increase assumption for foreign plans reflect local economic conditions and the Companys compensation strategy in those locations.
 
60
 
The health care cost trend rate is assumed to decrease gradually from 7.5% to 5.0% by 2019 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:
 
Year-end amounts applicable to the Companys pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were as follows:
Future expected benefit payments are as follows:
 
The Companys United States-based employees who are not covered by a bargaining unit and certain others are also eligible to participate in the Cameron International Corporation Retirement Savings Plan. Under this plan, employees savings deferrals are partially matched in cash and invested at the employees discretion. In connection with the termination of the Retirement Plan, as described above, the Company modified the Retirement Savings Plan, effective January 1, 2008, to provide enhanced benefits to eligible employees.  Beginning January 1, 2008, the Company provides nondiscretionary retirement contributions to the Retirement Savings Plan on behalf of each eligible employee equal to 3% of their defined pay (prior to January 1, 2008, the Company made cash contributions for hourly employees who were not covered under collective bargaining agreements and contributed 2% of pay for new employees hired after May 1, 2003, dependent on the Company meeting certain specified financial objectives).  Eligible employees vest in the 3% retirement contributions plus any earnings after completing three years of service.  In addition, the Company provides an immediately vested matching contribution of up to 100% of the first 6% of pay contributed by each eligible employee.  Prior to January 1, 2008, the Company matched up to 100% of the first 3% of pay contributed by each eligible employee and up to 50% of the next 3% of eligible employee contributions.  Employees may contribute amounts in excess of 6% of their pay to the Retirement Savings Plan, subject to certain United States Internal Revenue Service limitations. The Companys expense under this plan for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 amounted to $19,584,000, $13,228,000 and $10,524,000, respectively. In addition, the Company provides savings or other benefit plans for employees under collective bargaining agreements and, in the case of certain international employees, as required by government mandate, which provide for, among other things, Company matching contributions in cash based on specified formulas. Expense with respect to these various defined contribution and government-mandated plans for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 amounted to $33,846,000, $17,437,000 and $19,045,000, respectively.
 
Note 8: Stock-Based Compensation Plans
The Company has grants outstanding under four equity compensation plans, only one of which, the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (2005 EQIP), is currently available for future grants of equity compensation awards to employees and non-employee directors. The other three plans, which continue to have options outstanding at December 31, 2008, are the Companys Long-Term Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated as of November 2002, the Broadbased 2000 Incentive Plan and the Second Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors.  Options granted under the Companys four equity compensation plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and all terms were fixed.
 
61
 
Stock-based compensation expense recognized under the provisions of SFAS 123(R) was as follows:
  
The total income statement tax benefit recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006  totaled approximately $13,182,000, $12,004,000 and $9,780,000, respectively.
Stock option awards
Options with terms of seven years are granted to officers and other key employees of the Company under the 2005 EQIP plan at a fixed exercise price equal to the fair value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The options vest in one-third increments each year on the anniversary date following the date of grant, based on continued employment. Grants made in previous years to officers and other key employees under the Long-Term and Broadbased Incentive Plans provide similar terms, except that the options terminate after ten years rather than seven. 
A summary of option activity under the Companys stock compensation plans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 is presented below: 
 
 
The fair values per share of option grants for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula with the following weighted-average assumptions: 
 
62
 
    The Company determined the assumptions involving the expected life of its options and volatility rates based primarily on historical data and consideration of expectations for the future.
The above assumptions and market prices of the Companys common stock at the date of option exercises resulted in the following values:
Restricted and deferred stock unit awards
During 2005, the Company began issuing restricted stock units with no exercise price to key employees in place of stock options. During 2008 and 2007, grants of restricted stock units were made to officers and key employees. Approximately 72,634 and 235,433 of the restricted stock unit grants during 2008 and 2007, respectively, contained performance-based conditions which were fully satisfied based on the Companys full-year 2008 and 2007 financial performance against certain targets. The restricted stock units granted to officers and other key employees during 2008 and 2007 generally provided for three-year 100% cliff vesting on the third anniversary of the date of grant, based on continued employment. The restricted stock units granted to officers during 2006 generally provided for 12.5% vesting on each of the first and second anniversaries of the date of grant and a final vesting of 75% on the third anniversary of the date of grant, based on continued employment. Restricted stock units granted to other key employees during 2006 generally provided for 25% vesting on the second anniversary of the date of grant and a final vesting of 75% on the third anniversary of the date of grant, based on continued employment, whereas restricted stock units granted prior to January 1, 2006 generally provided for 25% vesting on each of the first and second anniversaries of the grant date and a final vesting of 50% on the third anniversary of the grant date, based on continued employment. 
Under an update to the Compensation Program for Non-Employee Directors approved by the Board of Directors in May 2008, non-employee directors are entitled to receive an annual number of deferred stock units that is equal to a value of $250,000 determined on the day following the Companys annual meeting of stockholders or, if a directors election to the Board occurs between annual meetings of stockholders, the initial grant of deferred stock units is based on a pro-rata portion of the annual grant amount equal to the remaining number of months in the board year until the next annual meeting of stockholders.  These units, which have no exercise price and no expiration date, vest in one-fourth increments quarterly over the following year but cannot be converted into common stock until the earlier of termination of Board service or three years, although Board members have the ability to voluntarily defer conversion for a longer period of time. 
A summary of restricted stock unit award activity under the Companys stock compensation plans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 is presented below: 
 
The intrinsic value of restricted stock units vesting during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $19,278,000, $5,277,000 and $3,451,000, respectively.
During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, a total of 639,799, 708,042 and 787,054 restricted stock units (post-split) at a weighted-average grant date fair value of $36.40, $29.04 and $20.82 per share (post-split) were granted. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing trading price of the Companys common stock on the grant date.  
At December 31, 2008, 1,102,091 shares were reserved for future grants of options, deferred stock units, restricted stock units and other awards. The Company may issue either treasury shares or newly issued shares of its common stock in satisfaction of these awards.

Note 9: Debt
    The Companys debt obligations were as follows: 
 
On June 26, 2008, the Company issued $450,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due July 15, 2018 (the 2018 Notes) and $300,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 7.0% Senior Notes due July 15, 2038 (the 2038 Notes and, together with the 2018 Notes, the Notes). The Company will pay interest on the Notes on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2009.  The Company may redeem some of the Notes from time to time or all of the Notes at any time at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole premium as defined in the respective supplemental indentures (the Supplemental Indentures).  In the event of the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event, as defined in the Supplemental Indentures, the holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with all of the Companys other existing unsecured and unsubordinated debt.
On April 14, 2008, the Company entered into a new multicurrency revolving credit facility providing for borrowings up to $585,000,000. The new facility, which replaced the existing $350,000,000 multicurrency revolving credit facility, expires on April 14, 2013. The facility allows the Company to borrow funds at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 40 basis points (including a facility fee), which varies based on the Company's current debt rating, and, if aggregate outstanding credit exposure exceeds one-half of the total facility amount, an additional 10-basis-point fee is incurred. The Company, at its option, may also borrow at other specified rates as defined in the credit facility. Additionally, the Company is required to maintain a total debt-to-capitalization ratio of no more than 60% during the term of the agreement. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had Pound Sterling borrowings outstanding totaling 10,000,000, under its $585,000,000 multicurrency revolving credit facility at an interest rate of 4.20% with a maturity date of January 20, 2009.
On April 16, 2007, the Company redeemed all $200,000,000 of its outstanding 2.65% Senior Notes (the Senior Notes) using available cash on hand. 
On May 23, 2006, the Company issued $500,000,000 face value of twenty-year senior convertible debentures, due June 15, 2026, that pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 2.5% on each June 15 and December 15, beginning December 15, 2006.  The Company has the right to redeem the 2.5% Convertible Debentures at any time on or after June 20, 2011, at principal plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2.5% Convertible Debentures on June 15 of 2011, 2016 and 2021, or at any time the Company undergoes a fundamental change as defined in the debenture agreement, for principal plus accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to June 15, 2011, holders may also convert their debenture holdings into shares of common stock at a conversion rate of 28.2656 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount, or $35.38 per share (post-split basis), only under the following circumstances: 
Holders may also convert the 2.5% Convertible Debentures into shares of common stock at any time on or after June 15, 2011 without meeting the above provisions. In either case involving conversion by the holders, any amount due up to and including the principal amount of the debt and accrued but unpaid interest will be satisfied in cash by the Company. The portion of the conversion value of the debt in excess of principal may, at the option of the Company, be satisfied in either cash or shares of the Companys common stock. The initial conversion rate is subject to adjustment based on certain specified events or in the event the Company undergoes a fundamental change as defined. As part of the offering of the 2.5% Convertible Debentures, the Company agreed to file a shelf registration statement related to the resale of the debentures and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures within a specified period of time and to have the registration statement become effective and maintain effectiveness during periods specified in the debenture agreement. This registration statement was filed timely by the Company on August 14, 2006. If the registration statement subsequently ceases to be effective, the Company could be subject to liquidated damage payments of up to 0.50% per year on the principal amount of the 2.5% Convertible Debentures, payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year during the period that the registration statement is not effective, as defined in the debenture agreement. Immediately following the offering, the Company used approximately $190,220,000 of the proceeds to purchase 8,333,830 shares of the Companys common stock at an average cost of $22.83 per share (post-split basis). Remaining proceeds from the offering are available for acquisitions, further share repurchases and general corporate uses. 
 
 
In connection with the adoption of FSP APB 14-1, the Companys financial statements were retrospectively revised to reflect the recording in 2006 of an initial equity conversion value associated with the 2.5% Convertible Debentures of $72,692,000, with an offsetting discount recorded against the debentures in order to result in an effective interest rate of 5.9%, which is intended to reflect a borrowing rate on similar debt without a conversion option (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).  The remaining unamortized discount on this debt at December 31, 2008 was $37,758,000 ($51,902,000 at December 31, 2007).
  
 
64
 
During 2004, the Company issued an aggregate amount of $238,000,000 face value of twenty-year convertible debentures due 2024 with an interest rate of 1.5%, payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15. The Company has the right to redeem the 1.5% Convertible Debentures anytime after May 15, 2009 at the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, and the debenture holders have the right to require the Company to repurchase the debentures on the fifth, tenth and fifteenth anniversaries of the issue. The 1.5% Convertible Debentures are convertible into the Companys common stock at a rate of 57.9428 shares per debenture, or $17.26 per share (post-split basis). The holders can convert the debentures into the Companys common stock only under the following circumstances: 
The Company has elected to use the cash pay provision with respect to its 1.5% Convertible Debentures for any debentures tendered for conversion or designated for redemption. Under this provision, the Company will satisfy in cash its conversion obligation for 100% of the principal amount of any debentures submitted for conversion, with any remaining amount to be satisfied in shares of the Companys common stock. 
In connection with the adoption of FSP APB 14-1, the Companys financial statements were retrospectively revised to reflect the recording in 2004 of an initial equity conversion value associated with the 1.5% Convertible Debentures of $35,026,000, with an offsetting discount recorded against the debentures in order to result in an effective interest rate of 4.85%, which is intended to reflect a borrowing rate on similar debt without a conversion option (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).  The remaining unamortized discount on this debt at December 31, 2008 was $785,000 ($10,784,000 at December 31, 2007).
  During 2008, the Company notified the holders of its 1.5% and 2.5% Convertible Debentures of their rights under the terms of the debentures to request conversion of those debentures.  As a result of conversions by the holders, $106,891,000 principal value of the 1.5% Convertible Debentures were repaid by the Company in cash during 2008 along with the issuance of 3,975,147 new shares of the Companys common stock to satisfy the excess of the conversion value of the debentures over the principal balance.  In connection with the adoption of FSP APB 14-1, the Company has retrospectively revised its 2008 financial statements to reflect a pre-tax gain of $569,000 as a reduction to interest expense in connection with the early conversion of the debentures.  The Company has included the remainder of its 1.5% Convertible Debentures, totaling a face value of $131,109,000, in the current portion of long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008 as holders of those debentures have the right to require the Company to repurchase them on May 15, 2009.
In addition to the above, the Company also has other unsecured and uncommitted credit facilities available to its foreign subsidiaries to fund ongoing operating activities. Certain of these facilities also include annual facility fees. 
Other debt, some of which is held by entities located in countries with high rates of inflation, has a weighted-average interest rate of 15.8% at December 31, 2008 (12.8% at December 31, 2007). Future maturities of the Companys debt (including the remaining amount of unamortized discount but excluding capital leases) are approximately $155,732,000 in 2009, $15,000 in 2010, $462,242,000 in 2011, and $747,972,000 thereafter. Maturities in 2009 and 2011 are mainly related to the 1.5% Convertible Debentures and the 2.5% Convertible Debentures, which the holders have the right to require the Company to repurchase on May 15, 2009 and June 15, 2011, respectively.  Maturities thereafter are related to the 6.375% and 7.0% Senior Notes issued during 2008.
Interest paid during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 approximated $47,448,000, $17,279,000 and $19,515,000, respectively.
 
65
 
Note 10: Leases
The Company leases certain facilities, office space, vehicles and office, data processing and other equipment under capital and operating leases. Rental expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $49,582,000, $42,709,000 and $32,148,000, respectively. Future minimum lease payments with respect to capital leases and operating leases with noncancelable terms in excess of one year were as follows:
 
Note 11: Income Taxes
The components of income before income taxes were as follows: 
The provisions for income taxes were as follows: 
 
 
66
 
The reasons for the differences between the provision for income taxes and income taxes using the U.S. federal income tax rate were as follows:
Components of deferred tax assets (liabilities) were as follows:
The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized an increase of $13,888,000 in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with (i) a corresponding decrease of $4,996,000 in the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings, (ii) a decrease of $2,000,000 in capital in excess of par relating to amounts previously recognized in connection with the tax benefit of employee stock benefit plan transactions and (iii) an increase in deferred tax assets of $6,892,000. This adjustment resulted in a total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007 of $42,789,000. 
 
67
 
Changes in the Companys unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:
 
The Company is not currently aware of any adjustments that may occur that would materially increase or decrease the amount of its unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve-month period or any material amounts included as unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008 that, if recognized, would not impact the Companys effective income tax rate.
There were no material payments for interest or penalties for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 or 2006. Also, there were no material accruals for unpaid interest or penalties at December 31, 2008 or 2007.
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the United States, various domestic states and localities and in many foreign jurisdictions. The earliest years tax returns filed by the Company that are still subject to examination by authorities in the major tax jurisdictions are as follows:
 
Primarily due to changes in estimates concerning the realizability of certain deferred tax assets, valuation allowances increased in 2008 by $7,103,000, decreased in 2007 by $6,897,000 and increased in 2006 by $2,902,000, with a corresponding offset in the Companys income tax expense. In addition, valuation allowances were established in 2007 in the amount of $7,400,000, to offset the tax benefit of net operating losses and other deferred tax assets recorded as part of international acquisitions. Similar valuation allowances established in prior years were reduced in 2008 and 2007 by $7,650,000 and $591,000, respectively, with a corresponding offset to goodwill. Certain valuation allowances are recorded in the non-U.S. dollar functional currency of the respective operation and the U.S. dollar equivalent reflects the effects of translation. The valuation allowance decreased in 2008 by $4,612,000 and increased in 2007 and 2006 by $3,830,000 and $1,728,000, respectively, due to translation. 
At December 31, 2008, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward in Brazil of approximately $31,000,000 which has no expiration period, and U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards with various expiration periods. The Company had a valuation allowance of $28,748,000 as of December 31, 2008 against these net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets.  The Company has considered all available evidence in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, including future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. 
The tax benefit that the Company receives with respect to certain stock benefit plan transactions is credited to capital in excess of par value and does not reduce income tax expense. This benefit amounted to $22,548,000, $32,239,000 and $23,284,000 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
The Company considers all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, except certain amounts primarily earned before 2003 and amounts previously subjected to tax in the U.S., to be permanently reinvested. An estimate of the amounts considered permanently reinvested is $1,437,000,000. It is not practical for the Company to compute the amount of additional U.S. tax that would be due on this amount. The Company has provided deferred income taxes on the earnings that the Company anticipates will be remitted.
The Company operates in jurisdictions in which it has been granted tax holidays. Currently the benefit of these holidays is not material.
 
Note 12: Stockholders

Common Stock
On December 7, 2007, stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 150,000,000 to 400,000,000. Additionally, effective December 28, 2007, the Company implemented a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend at that date.
In February 2006, the Companys Board of Directors changed the number of shares of the Companys common stock authorized for repurchase from the 5,000,000 shares authorized in August 2004 to 10,000,000 shares in order to reflect the 2-for-1 stock split effective December 15, 2005. This authorization was subsequently increased to 20,000,000 in connection with the 2-for-1 stock split effective December 28, 2007 and eventually to 30,000,000 by a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors on February 21, 2008. Additionally, on May 22, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved repurchasing shares of the Companys common stock with the proceeds remaining from the Companys 2.5% Convertible Debenture offering, after taking into account a planned repayment of $200,000,000 principal amount of the Companys outstanding 2.65% Senior Notes due 2007. This authorization is in addition to the 30,000,000 shares described above. 
 
68
 
Purchases pursuant to the 30,000,000-share Board authorization may be made by way of open market purchases, directly or indirectly, for the Companys own account or through commercial banks or financial institutions and by the use of derivatives such as a sale or put on the Companys common stock or by forward or economically equivalent transactions. 
Changes in the number of shares of the Companys outstanding stock for the last three years were as follows:
 
    At December 31, 2008, 11,763,790 shares of unissued common stock were reserved for future issuance under various employee benefit plans.
 
Preferred Stock
The Company is authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share.  Shares of preferred stock may be issued in one or more series of classes, each of which series or class shall have such distinctive designation or title as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors of the Company prior to issuance of any shares.  Each such series or class shall have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in such resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of such series or class of preferred stock as may be adopted by the Board of Directors prior to the issuance of any shares thereof.  On October 1, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to create a Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a par value of $0.01 per share. Under the amendment, the Company is authorized to issue up to 3,000,000 of the 10,000,000 authorized shares as Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, none of which were issued or outstanding at December 31, 2008. Additionally, on December 17, 2007, the Company filed an amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate all references in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to the previously authorized Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. As a result, all authorized shares of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock have now been cancelled.
 
Stockholder Rights Plan
The Companys Board of Directors adopted a Rights Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2007 (the Rights Agreement), between the Company and its Rights Agent to replace the existing Rights Agreement which was set to expire on October 31, 2007. Subject to entering into the Rights Agreement, the Board of Directors declared, on October 1, 2007, a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right (a Right) for each outstanding share of Common Stock, payable on October 31, 2007 to stockholders of record on that date. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $400 per one one-hundredth of a share of Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment. 
The Rights are not exercisable until the occurrence of certain events specified in the Rights Agreement involving the actual or planned acquisition or beneficial ownership by a person or group of affiliated persons of 20% or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company at that time. Upon exercise, each holder, other than those involved in acquiring or owning 20% or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company, will have the right to receive common stock or other assets having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right. The Company may redeem the Rights at a price of $0.01 per Right at any time until the tenth business day following a potential acquisition of the Company as described above or expiration of the Rights. The Rights, if not exercised or redeemed earlier by the Company, will expire on October 31, 2017.

Retained Earnings
Delaware law, under which the Company is incorporated, provides that dividends may be declared by the Companys Board of Directors from a current years earnings as well as from the total of capital in excess of par value plus the retained earnings, which amounted to approximately $3,064,506,000 at December 31, 2008.
 
Note 13: Accumulated Other Elements of Comprehensive Income
Accumulated other elements of comprehensive income comprised the following:
 
 
Note 14: Business Segments
    The Companys operations are organized into three separate business segments - DPS, V&M and CS.
    Based upon the amount of equipment installed worldwide and available industry data, DPS is one of the worlds leading providers of systems and equipment used to control pressures, direct flows of oil and gas wells and separate oil and gas from impurities. DPSs products include surface and subsea production systems, blowout preventers, drilling and production control systems, oil and gas separation equipment, gate valves, actuators, chokes, wellheads, drilling riser and aftermarket parts and services.
Based upon the amount of equipment installed worldwide and available industry data, V&M is a leading provider of valves and also supplies measurement systems primarily used to control, direct and measure the flow of oil and gas as they are moved from individual wellheads through flow lines, gathering lines and transmission systems to refineries, petrochemical plants and industrial centers for processing. V&Ms products include gate valves, ball valves, butterfly valves, Orbit valves, double block and bleed valves, plug valves, globe valves, check valves, actuators, chokes and aftermarket parts and services. Measurement products include totalizers, turbine meters, flow computers, chart recorders, ultrasonic flow meters and sampling systems.
CS provides reciprocating and integrally geared centrifugal compression equipment and related aftermarket parts and services for the energy industry and for manufacturing companies and chemical process industries worldwide.
The Companys primary customers are oil and gas majors, national oil companies, independent producers, engineering and construction companies, drilling contractors, rental companies, geothermal energy and independent power producers, pipeline operators, major chemical, petrochemical and refining companies, natural gas processing and transmission companies, compression leasing companies, durable goods manufacturers, utilities and air separation companies.
The Company markets its equipment through a worldwide network of sales and marketing employees supported by agents and distributors in selected international locations. Due to the extremely technical nature of many of the products, the marketing effort is further supported by a staff of engineering employees.
The Company expenses all research and product development and enhancement costs as incurred, or if incurred in connection with a product ordered by a customer, when the revenue associated with the product is recognized. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company incurred research and product development costs, including costs incurred on projects designed to enhance or add to its existing product offerings, totaling approximately $68,665,000, $59,585,000 and $44,576,000, respectively. DPS accounted for 69%, 68% and 81% of each respective years total costs.
 
70
 
Summary financial data by segment follows: 
For internal management reporting, and therefore in the above segment information, Corporate and Other includes expenses associated with the Companys Corporate office, as well as all of the Companys interest income, interest expense, certain litigation expense managed by the Companys General Counsel, foreign currency gains and losses from certain intercompany lending activities managed by the Companys centralized Treasury function, the charge for the termination of the U.S. defined benefit pension plans and all of the Companys stock compensation expense. Consolidated interest income and expense are treated as a Corporate item because cash equivalents and debt, including location, type, currency, etc., are managed on a worldwide basis by the Corporate Treasury Department. In addition, income taxes are managed on a worldwide basis by the Corporate Tax Department and are therefore treated as a corporate item. 
Revenue by shipping location and long-lived assets by country were as follows: 
 
71
 
 
Note 15: Earnings Per Share
    The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for each period presented was as follows: 
 
Diluted shares and net income used in computing diluted earnings per common share have been calculated using the if-converted method for the Companys 1.75% Convertible Debentures for the period they were outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2006. The Companys 1.5% and 2.5% Convertible Debentures have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, since the average market price of the Companys common stock exceeded the conversion price of the debentures during all or a portion of both periods. The Companys 1.5% Convertible Debentures have also been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 for the same reasons mentioned above. The Companys 2.5% Convertible Debentures have not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006, as the conversion price of the debentures was in excess of the average market price of the Companys common stock during the year. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding conversion of these debentures.
 
Note 16: Summary of Noncash Operating, Investing and Financing Activities
    The effect on net assets of noncash operating, investing and financing activities was as follows:

Note 17: Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Guarantees, Concentrations of Credit Risk and Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Guarantees
At December 31, 2008, the Company was contingently liable with respect to $730,100,000 of bank guarantees and standby letters of credit issued on its behalf by major domestic and international financial institutions in connection with the delivery, installation and performance of the Companys products under contract with customers throughout the world. The Company was also liable to these financial institutions for financial letters of credit and other guarantees issued on its behalf totaling $13,515,000 which provide security to third parties relating to the Companys ability to meet specified financial obligations, including payment of leases, customs duties, insurance and other matters. Additionally, the Company was liable for $6,719,000 of insurance bonds at December 31, 2008 relating to the requirements in certain foreign jurisdictions where the Company does business that the Company hold insurance bonds rather than bank guarantees.
The Companys other off-balance sheet risks were not material at December 31, 2008.
 
Concentrations of Credit Risk
    Apart from its normal exposure to its customers, who are predominantly in the energy industry, the Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2008. The Company typically does not require collateral for its customer trade receivables.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, derivative instruments and debt instruments. The book values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, derivative instruments and floating-rate debt instruments are considered to be representative of their respective fair values. Certain cash equivalents have also been valued based on quoted market prices which are considered to be Level 1 market imputs as defined in SFAS 157.  At December 31, 2008, the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate debt (based on Level 1 quoted market rates) was approximately $1,303,470,000 as compared to $1,381,109,000 face value of the debt.
In order to mitigate the effect of exchange rate changes, the Company will often attempt to structure sales contracts to provide for collections from customers in the currency in which the Company incurs its manufacturing costs. In certain instances, the Company will enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge specific large anticipated receipts or disbursements in currencies for which the Company does not traditionally have fully offsetting local currency expenditures or receipts. The Company was party to a number of long-term foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2008. The purpose of the majority of these contracts was to hedge large anticipated non-functional currency cash flows on major subsea, drilling or valve contracts involving the Companys United States operations and its wholly-owned subsidiaries in Brazil, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Singapore and the United Kingdom. The Company determines the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency forward contracts based on quoted exchange rates for the respective currencies applicable to similar instruments.  These quoted exchange rates are considered to be Level 2 observable market inputs as defined in SFAS 157.  Information relating to the contracts and the estimated fair values recorded in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2008 and 2007 follows:

Note 18: Contingencies
    The Company is subject to a number of contingencies, including environmental matters, litigation and tax contingencies.
 
Environmental Matters
The Companys worldwide operations are subject to regulations with regard to air, soil and water quality as well as other environmental matters. The Company, through its environmental management system and active third-party audit program, believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations.

The Company is currently identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) with respect to two sites designated for cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) or similar state laws. One of these sites is Osborne, Pennsylvania (a landfill into which a predecessor of the CS operation in Grove City, Pennsylvania deposited waste), where remediation is complete and remaining costs relate to ongoing ground water treatment and monitoring. The other is believed to be a de minimis exposure. The Company is also engaged in site cleanup under the Voluntary Cleanup Plan of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality at former manufacturing locations in Houston and Missouri City, Texas. Additionally, the Company has discontinued operations at a number of other sites which had been active for many years. The Company does not believe, based upon information currently available, that there are any material environmental liabilities existing at these locations. At December 31, 2008, the Companys consolidated balance sheet included a noncurrent liability of approximately $6,847,000 for environmental matters.
 
Legal Matters
In 2001, the Company discovered that contaminated underground water from the former manufacturing site in Houston referenced above had migrated under an adjacent residential area. Pursuant to applicable state regulations, the Company notified the affected homeowners. Concerns over the impact on property values of the underground water contamination and its public disclosure led to a number of claims by homeowners.
The Company has entered into a number of individual settlements and has settled a class action lawsuit. Twenty-one of the individual settlements were made in the form of agreements with homeowners that obligated the Company to reimburse them for any estimated decline in the value of their homes at time of sale due to potential buyers concerns over contamination or, in the case of some agreements, to purchase the property after an agreed marketing period. Three of these agreements have had no claims made under them yet. The Company has also settled ten other property claims by homeowners who have sold their properties. In addition, the Company has settled Valice v. Cameron Iron Works, Inc. (80th Jud. Dist. Ct., Harris County, filed June 21, 2002), which was filed and settled as a class action. Pursuant to the settlement, the homeowners who remained part of the class are entitled to receive a cash payment of approximately 3% of the 2006 appraised value of their property or reimbursement of any diminution in value of their property due to contamination concerns at the time of any sale. To date, 71 homeowners have elected the cash payment.
Of the 258 properties included in the Valice class, there were 21 homeowners who opted out of the class settlement. There are three suits currently pending regarding this matter filed by non-settling homeowners. Moldovan v. Cameron Iron Works, Inc. (165th Jud. Dist. Ct., Harris County, filed October 23, 2006), was filed by six such homeowners. The other suits were filed by individual homeowners, Tuma v. Cameron Iron Works, Inc. (334th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, filed on November 27, 2006), and Rudelson v. Cooper Industries, Inc. (189th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas, filed on November 29, 2006). The remaining homeowners who opted out of the class action settlement have retained counsel but have not filed suit.  The complaints filed in these actions, and the claims asserted by the remaining homeowners, make the claim that the contaminated underground water has reduced property values and seek recovery of alleged actual and exemplary damages for the loss of property value.
While one suit related to this matter involving health risks has been filed, the Company is of the opinion that there is no health risk to area residents and that the suit is without merit.
The Company believes, based on its review of the facts and law, that any potential exposure from existing agreements, the class action settlement or other actions that have been or may be filed, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. The Companys consolidated balance sheet included a liability of $13,136,000 for these matters as of December 31, 2008.
The Company has been named as a defendant in a number of multi-defendant, multi-plaintiff tort lawsuits since 1995. At December 31, 2008, the Companys consolidated balance sheet included a liability of approximately $3,230,000 for such cases, including estimated legal costs. The Company believes, based on its review of the facts and law, that the potential exposure from these suits will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
 
Regulatory Contingencies
In January 2007, the Company underwent a Pre-Assessment Survey as part of a Focused Assessment Audit initiated by the Regulatory Audit Division of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security.  The Pre-Assessment Survey resulted in a finding that the Company had deficiencies in its U.S. Customs compliance process and had underpaid customs duties.  The Company has taken corrective action and will close out all matters regarding duties owed on prior shipments through March 2009, which will require the payment of an additional $1,700,000 for previously underpaid duties.  The Company expects that assessment compliance testing will be completed and the Focused Assessment Audit will be concluded by the third quarter of 2009.
In July 2007, the Company was one of a number of companies to receive a letter from the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information on their use of a freight forwarder and customs clearance broker. The DOJ is inquiring into whether certain of the services provided to the Company by the freight forwarder may have involved violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The Company is conducting an internal investigation in response, as discussed below, and is providing the requested information to the DOJ.
The Company engaged special counsel reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to conduct an investigation into its dealings with the freight forwarder to determine if any payment made to or by the freight forwarder and customs clearing broker on the Companys behalf constituted a violation of the FCPA. The investigation is also looking into activities of Company employees and agents with respect to immigration matters and importation permitting. To date, the special counsel has found that the Company utilized certain services in Nigeria offered by the customs broker that appear to be similar to services that have been under review by the DOJ. Special counsel is reviewing these and other services and activities to determine whether they were conducted in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Special counsel is also reviewing the extent, if any, of the Companys knowledge, and its involvement in the performance, of these services and activities and whether the Company fulfilled its obligations under the FCPA.

In addition, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is conducting an informal inquiry into the same matters currently under review by the DOJ. As part of this inquiry the SEC has requested that the Company provide to them the information and documents that have been requested by and are being provided to the DOJ. The Company is cooperating fully with the SEC, as it is doing with the DOJ, and is providing the requested materials. At this stage of the internal investigation, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of either the internal investigation or the government inquiries. The Company has also undertaken an enhanced compliance training effort for its personnel, including foreign operations personnel dealing with customs clearance regulations and hired a Chief Compliance Officer in September 2008 to assume all legal compliance matters for the Company.
 
Tax Contingencies
The Company has legal entities in over 35 countries. As a result, the Company is subject to various tax filing requirements in these countries. The Company prepares its tax filings in a manner which it believes is consistent with such filing requirements. However, some of the tax laws and regulations which the Company is subject to are subject to interpretation and/or judgment. Although the Company believes that the tax liabilities for periods ending on or before the balance sheet date have been adequately provided for in the financial statements, to the extent that a taxing authority believes that the Company has not prepared its tax filings in accordance with the authoritys interpretation of the tax laws/regulations, the Company could be exposed to additional taxes.
