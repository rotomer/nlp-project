The Purpose of Our Code
 
 
Reading and adhering to our Code helps each of us follow the Cameron Way. Our Code applies to everyone conducting business on Camerons behalf, including employees and officers of Cameron (our Company). In addition, this Code applies to all of our suppliers, consultants, representatives, agents, contractors and subcontractors.
 
 
Our Code has been approved and adopted by Camerons Board of Directors.  Any change or waiver of our Code requires the approval of our Board of Directors.
 
 
Our Code cannot anticipate every situation we might encounter. However, it will help us make sound, ethical decisions. Our Code serves as a guide, referencing the Company policies and applicable laws and regulations we must know in order to act according to our Companys expectations. In addition, it directs us to the resources we should contact when we have questions and concerns.
 
 
We are expected to familiarize ourselves with and abide by our Code. Each of us will be asked to certify our compliance with our Code and our knowledge of others compliance on at least an annual basis. All full-time employees, temporary employees and contractors are responsible for completing additional compliance training that elaborates on many of the areas found within our Code.
 
 
If you have any questions about our Code, ask before acting. Reach out to your supervisor or call the Ethics HelpLine.

Reporting Concerns and Seeking Guidance
 
 
We may encounter situations where we are unsure of the right course of action. If you find yourself in such a situation, ask yourself, If you feel this would be embarrassing, its most likely unethical. Dont follow through with the action youre contemplating. Instead, seek guidance.
What if my actions were broadcast on the local news for all of my coworkers, family and friends to see?
 
When you have a question about our Code, Company policy or a specific situation, reach out to one of the resources listed below. In addition, if you become aware of a situation that you know or suspect violates our Code or the law, you have a duty to Cameron and your fellow employees to report it. When seeking guidance or making a report, you may:
 
 
 
 
2
Doing Whats Right. Together.
 
 
The Ethics HelpLine is operated by an independent third party and is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You may make a report or ask a question in over 150 languages. Please note, calls to the HelpLine are never recorded or traced. Any information you provide will be treated as confidentially as possible. Where local law allows, you may choose to report anonymously. However, please remember that providing your name and contact information will help Cameron conduct the most thorough investigation possible.
 
 
Regardless of how you choose to report, all reports of actual or suspected misconduct will be taken seriously and addressed promptly. Our Company will carefully investigate the reports and take appropriate action whenever necessary.
 
 
Violations of Our Code
 
 
We must all adhere to this Code and Cameron policies. Violations of our Code, our Companys policies or the law have serious consequences, including disciplinary action up to and including termination, as well as possible civil or criminal penalties.
 
 
No Retaliation
 
 
Cameron recognizes that, to maintain a culture of integrity, it must protect us when we report perceived or actual misconduct. Therefore, our Company strictly prohibits acts of retaliation against us for reporting a possible violation in good faith. Reporting in good faith means you are providing all of the information you have, and you believe it to be true.
 
 
In addition, you will not be retaliated against for participating in an investigation involving possible misconduct. Individuals who take action against a person for making a report or participating in an investigation will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. If you believe that you have been retaliated against, call the Ethics HelpLine or the Chief Compliance Officer.
 
 
Duty to Cooperate
 
 
Our Company carefully investigates all reports of misconduct. To help this process, we must cooperate fully and honestly in an investigation of potential illegal or unethical activity. You will not face retaliation for doing so.
 
 
Higher Expectations for Managers
 
 
While our Code applies to all of us, managers are held to higher expectations because of their role as leaders within our Company This means not only living the principles set forth in our Code every day but also taking action to create a positive work environment, leading by example and making  sure that employees are comfortable raising concerns and asking questions.
.
 
 
 
3
Doing Whats Right. Together.
 
 
As a manager, it is your responsibility to deal with and report any ethical or legal misconduct, whether you witness the misconduct yourself or receive a report about it. If you cannot resolve a report on your own, you must find someone who can. Follow through with that person to make sure the problem is resolved.

Treating One Another Fairly
 
 
At Cameron, our success depends upon each of us fully respecting the rights of our fellow employees and encouraging open communication. We strive to solicit the input of our coworkers and listen to their views. We each have a right to our own opinions, and we are expected to respect the viewpoints of others.
 
 
Respecting Each Other
 
 
Commitment to a Diverse Workforce
 
 
With over 300 locations in more than 35 countries worldwide and growing, our global workforce is incredibly diverse. With such diversity comes unique ideas, viewpoints, talents and values that directly contribute to our Companys success.
 
 
Discrimination and Harassment-Free Workplace
 
 
To maintain our culture of diversity, we are committed to a discrimination-free workplace. This means we must make all employment decisions based on merit and without regard for race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, marital status, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, veterans status or any other protected characteristic. For additional information, please see our
Equal Employment Opportunity Policy.
 
 
We all have the right to work in an environment free from harassment. Harassment is a form of discrimination that consists of unwelcome behavior that has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. Harassment can come in many forms, including physical actions, verbal or written remarks, or visual depictions. Our Company strictly prohibits any acts of harassment, whether done by an employee or a non-employee. If you have any questions, please see our
Harassment-Free Workplace Policy
.
 
 
Discriminatory or harassing behavior violates our Code and Company policies. If you feel you or someone around you has experienced harassment or discrimination, report the situation. Rest assured, you will not face retaliation for making this good faith report.

Q: Claudia worked with a contract engineer, Andrei, on a project for several months. Andrei waited until the project was complete to ask Claudia out on a date, but she turned him down. Now, Andrei repeatedly emails and calls to ask her out again, no matter how many times she asks him to stop. Since Andrei is no longer working for Cameron, Claudia isnt sure if his conduct constitutes harassment. What should she do?

Doing Whats Right. Together.
 
 
A: Andreis actions definitely constitute harassment, which is prohibited whether or not his work for Cameron has ended. Claudia should report Andreis behavior as soon as possible to any of the contacts listed in Reporting Concerns and Seeking Guidance.

Providing a Healthy and Safe Work Environment
 
 
Workplace Health and Safety
 
 
Our success, and the success of Cameron as a whole, depends upon maintaining a safe and healthy work environment. Because our people are our most importance resource, safety is our number one priority in all of our locations and at all levels of our organization. This means that we must each constantly strive to achieve injuries and work-related illnesses. To prevent workplace injury and illness, we must:

Workplace Violence
 
 
As part of our commitment to health and safety, we must never tolerate any acts or threats of violence in our workplace. To keep our work environment free from violence or intimidation, we may not bring any weapons or firearms onto Company premises, including parking facilities. We also may not carry weapons while conducting business on Camerons behalf. You should report any threatening or violent behavior you witness to your supervisor promptly.
 
 
Substance-Free Environment
 
 
While conducting business on behalf of Cameron, we must be free from the influence of drugs, alcohol or other substances that impair our ability to work safely and effectively. To ensure our safety and the safety of those around us, we may not use, possess, distribute or sell alcohol or controlled substances on Company premises or when working on Camerons behalf. This rule does not apply to Cameron-sponsored or other authorized events where alcohol is served. In these situations, moderate consumption is allowed.

Doing Whats Right. Together.
 
 
We must also abide by any drug and alcohol policies in our local facilities and comply with any required drug or alcohol testing. For additional information, please see our or ask your supervisor about any policies unique to your facility.
Drug-Free Workplace Policy
 
 
We are aware of the effect our operations have on the global climate. Therefore, we continuously seek to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions.

We seek to make efficient use of natural resources through innovative product design, operational excellence and effective facility management. Whenever practical, we work to conserve our natural resources and to reduce or eliminate hazardous wastes and emissions from our manufacturing processes. We handle any generated wastes safely and responsibly.

Q: Adriana works in Research & Development in flow control technology. During her time on the job, Adriana formulates an idea to reduce waste and reduce the impact Cameron has on the environment. However, her idea involves expensive changes to our Companys operational processes. Should she pursue her idea?
 
 
A: Yes. Adriana should tell her supervisor about her concept and its environmental impact right away. Although our Company must consider its budget, we all have a responsibility to take all reasonable efforts to conserve natural resources and protect the environment. In most situations, long-term environmental solutions will outweigh short-term costs.

Maintaining Integrity with Our Communities

Conducting International Business
 
 
Cameron has developed a reputation as a good global citizen, and each of us must maintain this reputation. We strive to positively impact the many communities where we live and work. This means, in part, that we must uphold human rights in all of our facilities. We treat all people in all of our locations with respect, and seek to do business with suppliers that do the same.
 
 
We must also follow the laws of the communities where we operate, unless prohibited by U.S. law. When these laws, local customs or business practices differ from U.S. law or the rules set forth in our Code or Company policies, we must obtain prior permission from the Legal Department before conforming to them.
 
 
Following Anti-Corruption Laws
 
 
Cameron succeeds based on the quality of our people, services and products. We do not pay bribes or offer anything of value to with the purpose of obtaining an unfair advantage. Remembersimply a bribe violates our Code, Company policy and the law.
anyone
offering
 
 
Bribery and Kickbacks
 
 
Anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), apply to all of our operations around the globe. Our Companys interpretation of these laws is clear: we may not engage in bribery with, or offer, authorize or accept any form of kickback to or from, a government employee in order to keep or win business. Bribery is the offering, giving, receiving or soliciting of any item of value in order to influence someones actions. A kickback is a payment returned or promised to be returned as a result of a legal contract or as a reward for making or fostering business arrangements. To be clear, government employees include federal, state or local government employees, political candidates and even employees of government-owned enterprises such as nationally-owned oil companies
,
.
 
 
Facilitating payments are small fees imposed by government agencies to speed up routine government actions of a non-discretionary nature, such as processing papers and issuing permits. These payments are allowed under the anti-corruption laws of some countries. However, because these laws vary from one country to the next, we must receive written approval from the Legal Department making such a payment.
before
 
 
Remember that we cannot hire third parties to do something we are not allowed to do ourselves. We could be liable for violating anti-corruption laws even if we did not know, but should have known, that a bribe or kickback was going to a government employee
.
 
 
Consequences for violating anti-corruption laws are severe for both our Company and the individuals involved. If you regularly interact with government employees or other officials, be sure to familiarize yourself with and follow our and policies

Commercial Bribery
 
 
In developing goodwill and strong working relationships with suppliers, clients and partners, gifts and entertainment can be standard courtesies. However, we must be particularly careful that we do not engage in commercial bribery. This form of bribery occurs when we give or accept a business courtesy with intent of obtaining or retaining business. Keep in mind that commercial bribery can carry steep consequences.

Q: While working closely with a nationally-owned oil company, Marcos befriends Lucinda, a manager at the oil company. Lucinda mentions that her nephews company is applying for a small contract with Cameron in Marcos business unit. Can Marcos approve the contract in hopes of securing additional business with Lucindas company?
 
 
A: No, Marcos cannot approve this contract until Marias nephew has gone through Camerons standard bidding process. We cant offer anything of value, such as favors, to government employees in an attempt to retain or obtain business. This constitutes bribery, which is strictly prohibited at Cameron.
 
 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 
Complying with Import and Export Controls
 
 
The global nature of our business means that we must understand and comply with the laws and regulations that govern the export, re-export or import of goods or technology. Export activity takes place when a product or technical information is transferred from one country to another or is provided to a foreign citizen or representative of another country, no matter where that person is located. Whether or not an item is eligible for export depends upon the nature of the item, the country of destination and the end use or end user. Before engaging in exporting activity, we must verify the eligibility of both the location of delivery and the exports recipient. In addition, we must obtain all required and necessary licenses and permits and pay all proper duties.
 
 
Import activity, or bringing the products we purchase from others into a country, is also generally subject to various laws and regulations. In particular, this activity may trigger the payment of duties and taxes. It also may involve the filing of required documentation. We must always comply with all import requirements. Contact the Global Trade Compliance Group within the Legal Department if you have questions or concerns.
 
 
Remember, import and export controls do not simply apply to material or physical goods. They also relate to data, information, research and other intellectual property exchanged with overseas suppliers. Failure to obtain the appropriate government approvals before exporting goods or technology can result in serious consequences, such as the loss of export privileges, as well as civil and criminal penalties. If you are involved in importing or exporting goods, products or services, be sure to familiarize yourself with our and policiesConsult the Global Trade Compliance Group within the Legal Department if you have questions.

Q: Mariana, a procurement specialist, is leaving tomorrow on a last-minute trip to the Middle East. She needs to take her laptop, but realizes that it contains engineering drawings of a Cameron product, which means an export license or permit may be needed. Can she leave the country without obtaining the license, as long as a license application is submitted before she leaves?
 
 
A: No, this is not okay. Cameron must obtain any necessary permits or licenses Mariana can travel internationally with her laptop. If the drawings are not needed for her trip, she can avoid the license requirement by simply deleting the drawings from her laptops hard drive. If she is unsure whether she needs to obtain an export license, she should consult the Global Trade Compliance Group within the Legal Department.

Following Trade Bans
 
 
A trade ban, also known as a boycott, occurs when one group, business or country refuses to do business with a particular person or country. U.S. anti-boycott laws prohibit us from cooperating with boycotts that are not sanctioned by the United States, such as the Arab League boycott of Israel.It is important to note that, even when we are not conducting business in the United States, we must comply with U.S.-approved trade embargoes.
 
 
 
We are required by law to report all requests to participate in an unsanctioned boycott. Such requests are often hidden in seemingly harmless documents, like letters of credit or bills of lading. If you receive what you believe is such a request, contact the Legal Department immediately. Please see our for additional information.
Anti-Boycott Policy
 
 
Impacting Our Local Communities
 
 
As a good corporate citizen, Cameron seeks to promote the vitality of the communities where we live and work. We owe it to our neighbors to work towards the development and betterment of our communities, which sustain our Company and support us as individuals.
 
 
Political and Charitable Involvement
 
 
Our Company encourages each of us to actively participate in the political process. However, we should only do so voluntarily and during our personal time. We must make certain that participating in political activity in no way impairs our work effort or damages our Companys standing or image. We may never make political donations or contributions using our Companys name, time, funds or other resources.
 
 
To support the communities where we live and work, we are encouraged to participate in charitable activities both as a Company and as individuals. However, we must be sure that these activities are appropriate and lawful.
 
 
 
 
10
Doing Whats Right. Together.
 
 
We should never expect reimbursement for our participation in charitable activities. You will not be penalized in any way for choosing not to participate. If you have any questions about whether involvement in a charitable activity is proper business conduct, please consult your Group President or our CEO.

Ensuring Financial Integrity
 
 
Accurate Recordkeeping and Reporting
 
 
We all must do our part to ensure Camerons financial information is accurate and complete Our shareholders, among others, rely on us to do so. The records we create as part of our daily responsibilities have a significant impact on the financial information Cameron discloses. We must therefore be sure that all of the records we create and submit, including time cards, expense reports and inventory reports, are true, fair and accurate. At all times, we must act according to our internal controls procedures. We may never establish unrecorded slush funds or take other steps to falsify Camerons books and records.
.
 
 
If you become aware of any accounting or auditing irregularities, promptly report them to the Legal Department or the Ethics HelpLine. Consequences for falsifying financial records are severe, including potential criminal prosecution for the individuals involved and senior officers of our Company.
 
 
If you are management personnel or a financial officer involved in the preparation of public disclosures or the preparation of data for public disclosures, you must understand and comply with the
Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers
.
 
 
Proper Records Management
 
 
The proper retention of our documents and records is vital to our business. As such, we must maintain all documents, files and other covered communications according to our . This policy explains the proper timetable for retaining and destroying our records. If you are notified that your documents are relevant to an anticipated or pending litigation, investigation or audit, follow the guidelines set forth in the notification. Do not alter or conceal any document covered by the notification.
Records Management Policy
 
 
Email has become a standard tool in business communications. As such, the way we manage our email records is increasingly important. Company email messages will be automatically deleted from network servers soon after delivery, so exercise care in retaining those documents and files specific to our business.
 
 
If you have any questions regarding proper records management, see ouror contact the Corporate Secretary.
Records Management Policy
 
 
Audits and Investigations
 
 
We may be asked by an auditor or a government official to take part in an investigation of our Company or certain of our fellow employees. We must cooperate with these requests. However, if we receive a request to take part in a government investigation or a request for information or documentation from a government official, we should immediately contact the Legal Department. At no time may we attempt to improperly or unduly influence, or make untrue or misleading statements to an auditor or government official in connection with an investigation.

Q: Gavin works in a shipping dock and has worked quite a bit of overtime in the past week. His manager, Linda, tells him to not record this time, and instead to take a day off the next week. This way, hell be paid for all of his hard work and Linda wont be over her payroll budget for the department. Is this acceptable?
 
 
A: No. Gavin may think that this option is okay because it wont cost Cameron any extra money. But, time records are business records and it is extremely important that Gavin report his time accurately and honestly, and never create a false record. As such, Gavin shouldnt follow Lindas direction. Instead, he should report the situation to any of the contacts listed in Reporting Concerns and Seeking Guidance.

Safeguarding Our Company Assets
 
 
Physical Assets
 
 
Our Companys physical assets, such as its equipment, materials and facilities, are instrumental to performing our day-to-day responsibilities. These assets have been accumulated through the hard work of people spanning the globe. By working for Cameron, we have each assumed responsibility for these assets and must safeguard them from theft, loss, misuse and waste. In addition, we must make sure that they are used for appropriate business purposes.
 
 
Proprietary Information
 
 
Information is a large part of what gives us our competitive advantage. Many of us have access to Camerons confidential, proprietary information in order to perform our jobs. It is our responsibility to keep this information confidential and protected. It is also our responsibility to protect the information entrusted to us by our suppliers, customers and other business partners as carefully as we protect our own information.
 
 
A few examples of confidential or proprietary information include:
 
 
 
 
13
Doing Whats Right. Together.
 
 
We may only share this information with others who have a business need to know, whether inside or outside of Cameron. To protect this information and prevent its accidental disclosure, we must take proper precautions. Make sure that you follow all security measures and internal control procedures for your computer systems, portable electronic devices, laptops and other storage devices, such as flash drives and USB devices. You must carefully protect these devices in places where they could be lost or stolen. Do not divulge your password or access codes to anyone else, and do not allow others to use your accounts. Obtain the required Non-Disclosure Agreement prior to sharing any proprietary information outside the company.
 
 
Be cautious when discussing sensitive information on your cell phone or with a coworker in public places, such as elevators, airports and restaurants, or in open areas within Cameron, such as break rooms or restrooms. Do not leave documents containing sensitive information in a place where an unauthorized person might have the opportunity to read them, including your unlocked desk or on a copy machine.
 
 
Private Personal Information
 
 
Each of us provides Cameron private personal information, such as health records, social security information and contact information. We have an obligation to carefully safeguard our fellow employees private personal information. If you have access to such information, be certain to follow security protocols at all times and be diligent in protecting the information. You may only share that information with those who have a business need to know, and who are authorized to view the information.
 
 
Appropriate Use of Resources
 
 
Cameron understands that we may need to use Company equipment, such as computers or the telephone, for occasional personal communications. Such personal use is permitted, so long as it is moderate and does not result in any significant cost to our Company. We may never use our communications systems to engage in prohibited conduct, such as communicating or viewing discriminatory, harassing, sexually explicit or otherwise offensive or inappropriate material.
 
 
We should not expect privacy when using Cameron-owned and -issued computers or other equipment we use to communicate data and information. Where local law allows, Cameron reserves the right to monitor the usage of its computers and communications systems. Keep in mind that, if Cameron has provided you with a computer, PDA, cell phone or other portable technology, you must use that technology appropriately and in accordance with Company policies. Camerons policies on technology apply to Company-owned and -issued equipment, and do not change after hours or when you are traveling.

Avoiding Conflicts of Interest
 
 
When conducting business on behalf of Cameron, we must carefully avoid situations that could create a conflict of interest, or even the of one. A conflict of interest occurs when our interests or the interests of our family members compete with our ability to perform our job responsibilities. Such competing interests may limit our ability to perform our jobs objectively and without bias. If you feel you may face a conflict of interest situation, you should disclose it to your supervisor promptly. Reference our for additional information.

Gifts and Entertainment
 
 
Cameron prides itself on conducting its business honestly and transparently. While exchanging gifts and entertainment can foster good working relationships with our clients, suppliers and business partners, we must exercise caution when engaging in such activity. Remember, by giving gifts or entertainment, we may make it difficult for the recipient to make sound, objective business decisions. If we accept such courtesies, we may appear to be unduly influenced We must keep these principles in mind when we are offering or accepting gifts or entertainment.

At times, you may find yourself in a situation where you must return a gift, but doing so may be impractical (such as perishable items or personalized gifts) or discourteous. In these situations, you should accept the gift on behalf of our Company and turn it over to the Corporate Ethics and Compliance Department.

Q: Sandra is a field service technician in the Compression Systems group and has just finished an important job for a client. The client tells Sandra that they would like to send her something to show their appreciation, but she warns them that she cant accept anything expensive. The client sends Sandra a U.S. $50 gift certificate to a department store. May she keep it?
 
 
A: Although the gift certificate is only worth U.S. $50, which is an acceptable value, Sandra may not keep it. We may never accept gifts that are cash or a cash equivalent, no matter their value. Sandra should report the gift to her supervisor and return the gift. If she doesnt feel comfortable doing so, she should turn it over to the Corporate Ethics and Compliance Department.

Business with Family and Friends
 
 
When a personal or family relationship exists between employees, it may appear as though one of us is receiving preferential treatment over another. Therefore, no family member should be placed in a position where he or she has direct decision-making authority over another family member. If you find yourself in such a situation, disclose it to your supervisor immediately.
 
 
A perceived conflict of interest is also created if you, your immediate family member or a close friend holds a substantial financial interest in, or has a relationship with, the owner or principal of an actual or potential supplier, client or competitor of Cameron. If you find yourself in such a situation, you must notify your supervisor immediately and remove yourself entirely from the supplier selection or negotiation process.

Q: Pedros department is currently accepting bids for a steel supplier. Pedros brother, Philippe, owns a steel company and has decided to bid for the supplier contract with Cameron. Pedro knows neither of them are doing anything wrong, but isnt sure if he should disclose the situation. Should he?
 
 
A: Yes. Pedro should disclose his relationship with the bidding company to his supervisor immediately to avoid the appearance a conflict of interest. He will also need to remove himself from the supplier selection process.

Outside Employment
 
 
Engaging in employment outside of Cameron may prevent us from upholding our job duties objectively and without bias. For this reason, we may not take outside employment that interferes with our ability to fulfill our job duties. In addition, we cannot use Camerons property, information or resources for work with another company. Discuss any outside employment opportunities with your supervisor before accepting a position.

Q: Carla, an analyst for Cameron, is starting up her own consulting business. Although some of the consulting work she plans to do is similar to the work she does for Cameron, Carla plans to ensure that her business doesnt compete with Cameron. Is this okay?
 
 
A: Most likely, no. Because the work Carla will be doing is similar to the work she does for Cameron, she may be competing with Cameron without even knowing she is doing so. This poses a conflict of interest that may not be allowable. Before starting her business, Carla must disclose her plans to and obtain prior permission from her supervisor.

Financial Interest in an Outside Company
 
 
Investing can become a conflict of interest if the company you are investing in does business with or competes with Cameron. You are required to disclose any investments you hold in Camerons customers, suppliers or competitors.
 
 
Outside Boards of Directors
 
 
If you are offered a directorship or board membership position with an outside Company, you may accept only if you obtain advance approval from the Legal Department. Please note, if this position would impose a perceived or actual conflict of interest, approval will not be granted.
 
 
Corporate Opportunities
 
 
We all have a responsibility to act in Camerons best interests and advance these interests whenever the opportunity to do so arises. Taking personal advantage of a business opportunity learned through work done on Camerons behalf, or otherwise personally benefitting from Camerons information creates an inappropriate conflict of interest. While conducting work on behalf of Cameron, we may come across opportunities in which Cameron may also have an interest. If so, we must notify our supervisor of the opportunity and provide ample time for Cameron to determine whether it will pursue the opportunity. If, after this period of time, Cameron passes on the opportunity, we may act on it for our own personal gain. At this time, we may also share this information with outside parties for their personal gain.

Avoiding Insider Trading
 
 
By working on behalf of Cameron, we have all made a commitment to comply with insider trading laws. Insider trading occurs when we trade the stocks of a given company on the basis of material, nonpublic information we have acquired about that company through work we have done on Camerons behalf. Information is considered material if a reasonable investor would consider the information important in deciding whether to buy, sell or hold a stock or other security. Nonpublic information refers to that which has not yet been disclosed to or absorbed by the public. Material, nonpublic information generally includes information such as:
 
 
No matter where we are located, we must comply with Camerons insider trading policy, which also prohibits tipping. Tipping generally occurs when we provide material, nonpublic information to another person, and that person trades on the basis of the information. It is important to note that tipping can expose us to the same consequences brought about by insider trading. This may include severe penalties, including fines, termination of employment and potential imprisonment.

Q: Enrico has learned that Cameron is about to enter into a large supplier agreement with a U.S.-based public company. Enrico knows that, because of this contract, the suppliers U.S. stock price will most likely skyrocket soon after the deal is announced publicly. While he knows he cant personally buy stock in the supplier or tell anyone about the contract, he figures he can help his mom by encouraging her to buy the companys stock. Is this okay?
 
 
A: No. By tipping this information to his mother, Enrico is violating our Code and U.S. securities laws. Consequences for tipping can be just as severe as those for engaging in insider trading, so Enrico should refrain from providing any confidential information that he learns through his work at Cameron to anyone without a business need to know.

Complying with Anti-Competition Laws
 
 
To ensure markets operate fairly and efficiently, many nations have implemented laws to combat anti-competitive practices. We pride ourselves in strictly complying with these anti-competition laws, which are designed to protect free enterprise. While anti-competition laws are complex, they generally forbid discussing or entering into formal or informal agreements regarding activities that may restrain trade. Examples of such activities include:
 
 
Illegal agreements do not have to be signed contracts, and may be as simple as informal understandings between two parties. If any of these topics of discussion arise when talking with a competitor, such as at an industry association meeting or a trade show, you should stop the conversation immediately and report it to the Legal Department.
 
 
Violations of anti-competition laws carry severe consequences. Keep in mind that these laws can be difficult to understand and every country maintains its own laws regulating competition. Exercise caution and avoid any interaction with competitors that may place you or Cameron at risk. If you have any concerns about a conversation you have had or an activity you are involved in, please consult the Legal Department.

Q: While attending the Offshore Technology Conference, Edson speaks in front of a group of representatives of Camerons competitors. After Edson speaks, one of the representatives comes up to talk to him. While at first they talk about their families, the conversation soon turns to business. The representative tells Edson, I bet my companys bid for that contract probably isnt nearly as attractive as Camerons. Edson isnt sure how to respond to this comment. What should he do?
 
 
A: Edson should realize that this representative may be engaging in anti-competitive behavior. He should end the conversation immediately and report the incident to the Legal Department.

Gathering Competitor Information
 
 
Remaining a strong competitor in our industry sometimes requires that we gather information about our competitors. However, we must be sure to acquire such information in ways that are public, ethical and legal. You may always ask coworkers, clients and suppliers for information about competitors that they are free to share. However, you should not encourage them to provide information that would violate any binding legal agreements, such as contracts or non-disclosure agreements. For example, you should not seek a competitors confidential information from a new employee who formerly worked for the competitor.
