Item 1.01              Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On June 2, 2011, Cameron International Corporation (the "Company") completed the public offering of $250,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Company's 4.50% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes"), $250,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Company's 5.95% Senior Notes due 2041 (the "2041 Notes") and $250,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Company's Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014 (the "Floating Rate Notes" and, together with the 2021 Notes and the 2041 Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and RBS Securities Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The Company filed a copy of the Underwriting Agreement as Exhibit 1.1 to its Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 25, 2011. The issuance and sale of the Notes were registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"). The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to purchase or redeem the Company's 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 and for general corporate purposes.
 
The Company issued the Notes pursuant to the Indenture, dated June 26, 2008 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented with respect to the 2021 Notes by the Third Supplemental Indenture, dated June 2, 2011 (the "Third Supplemental Indenture"), as further supplemented with respect to the 2041 Notes by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated June 2, 2011 (the "Fourth Supplemental Indenture"), and as further supplemented with respect to the Floating Rate Notes by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated June 2, 2011 (the "Fifth Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the Third Supplemental Indenture and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture"), in each case between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee.
 
The Company will pay interest on the 2021 Notes and the 2041 Notes on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2011.  The 2021 Notes will mature on June 1, 2021 and the 2041 Notes will mature on June 1, 2041.  The Company may redeem some of the 2021 Notes and the 2041 Notes from time to time or all of the 2021 Notes and the 2041 Notes at any time at the redemption prices set forth in the Third Supplemental Indenture and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, respectively.
 
The Company will pay interest on the Floating Rate Notes on March 2, June 2, September 2 and December 2 of each year, beginning on September 2, 2011 at an initial rate of 3-month LIBOR, determined as of two London business days prior to June 2, 2011, which rate will be reset quarterly on March 2, June 2, September 2 and December 2 of each year, plus 0.93% per annum, as specified in the Fifth Supplemental Indenture.  The Floating Rate Notes will mature on June 2, 2014.  The Floating Rate Notes are not redeemable by the Company prior to their maturity.
 
The holders of the Notes may require the Company to redeem the Notes if the Notes are rated below investment grade following certain events that constitute a change of control of the Company.  The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank equally with all of the Company's other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt.  The Notes are not guaranteed by the Company's subsidiaries and will effectively rank junior to any secured debt of the Company and all existing and future debt and other liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.
 
The Notes offering was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-151838), which became effective upon its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on June 23, 2008. A Prospectus Supplement dated May 25, 2011 relating to the Notes and supplementing the Prospectus dated June 23, 2008 was filed with the SEC on May 27, 2011 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2) under the Securities Act.
 
Copies of the Base Indenture, the Third Supplemental Indenture, the Fourth Supplemental Indenture and the Fifth Supplemental Indenture are attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, Exhibit 4.2, Exhibit 4.3 and Exhibit 4.4, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

"Treasury Rate"
means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual or equivalent yield to maturity or interpolated (on a day count basis) of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate will be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
6.             .  Except as set forth in Section 5.01 of the Supplemental Indenture, the Issuer shall not be required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes or to repurchase them at the option of the Holders.

If any interest reset date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, the interest reset date will be postponed to the immediately succeeding day that is a Business Day, except that if that Business Day is in the immediately succeeding calendar month, the interest reset date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day.
 
The interest rate in effect on each day will be (1) if that day is an interest reset date, the interest rate determined as of the interest determination date (as defined below) immediately preceding such interest reset date or (2) if that day is not an interest reset date, the interest rate determined as of the interest determination date immediately preceding the most recent interest reset date or the original issue date, as the case may be.
 
Interest will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a 360-day year. The interest rate applicable to each interest reset period commencing on the related interest reset date, or the original issue date in the case of the initial interest period, will be the rate determined as of the applicable interest determination date. The "interest determination date" will be the

second London business day immediately preceding the original issue date, in the case of the initial interest reset period, and thereafter the applicable interest reset date.
 
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or its successor appointed by the Company, will act as calculation agent. Three-month LIBOR will be determined by the calculation agent as of the applicable interest determination date in accordance with the following provisions:
 
(1) LIBOR is the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars for the 3-month period commencing on the second London business day immediately following such interest determination date, which appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page (as defined below) at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the applicable interest determination date. "Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page" means the display designated on page "LIBOR01" on Reuters Screen (or such other page as may replace the LIBOR01 page on that service, any successor service or such other service or services as may be nominated by the British Bankers' Association for the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits). If no rate appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page, LIBOR for such interest determination date will be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) below.
 
(2) With respect to an interest determination date on which no rate appears on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such interest determination date, the calculation agent shall request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market selected by the calculation agent (after consultation with the Company) to provide the calculation agent with a quotation of the rate at which deposits of U.S. dollars having a three-month maturity, commencing on the second London business day immediately following such interest determination date, are offered by it to prime banks in the London interbank market as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such interest determination date in a principal amount equal to an amount of not less than U.S. $1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in such market at such time. If at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR for such interest determination date will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations as calculated by the calculation agent. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR for such interest determination date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted as of approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such interest determination date by three major banks selected by the calculation agent (after consultation with the Company) for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks having a three-month maturity commencing on the second London business day immediately following such interest determination date and in a principal amount equal to an amount of not less than U.S. $1,000,000 that is representative for a single transaction in such market at such time; provided, however, that if the banks selected as aforesaid by the calculation agent are not quoting such rates as mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR for such
interest determination date will be LIBOR determined with respect to the immediately preceding interest determination date.
 
All percentages resulting from any calculation of any interest rate will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all dollar amounts will be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward.
 
Promptly upon such determination, the calculation agent will notify the Company and the Trustee (if the calculation agent is not the Trustee) of the interest rate for the new interest reset period. Upon request of a Holder of Notes, the calculation agent will provide to such Holder the interest rate in effect on the date of such request and, if determined, the interest rate for the next interest reset period.
 
All calculations made by the calculation agent for the purposes of calculating interest shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders and the Company, absent manifest error.
 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the interest rate on this Note shall in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of general application.
 
If the maturity date of this Note is not a Business Day, the Company will pay interest, if any, and principal and premium, if any, on the next day that is a Business Day at such place of payment as if payment were made on the date such payment was due, and no interest will accrue on the amounts so payable for the period from and after such date to the immediately succeeding Business Day.
 
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

Cameron International Corporation
1333 West Loop South, Suite 1700
Houston, Texas 77027
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel for Cameron International Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), with respect to certain legal matters in connection with the registration by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), of the proposed offer and sale by the Company of $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2014 (the "2014 Notes"), $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes") and $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.95% Senior Notes due 2041 (the "2041 Notes" and, together with the 2014 Notes and the 2021 Notes, the "Notes"), to be issued and sold pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated May 25, 2011 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), by and among the Company, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co., Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and RBS Securities Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters").
 
The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to a prospectus supplement, dated May 25, 2011, (the "Prospectus Supplement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to Rule 424(b) on May , 2011, to a prospectus dated June 23, 2008 (such prospectus, as amended and supplemented by the Prospectus Supplement, the "Prospectus"), included in a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-151838) (the "Registration Statement"), which Registration Statement became effective upon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act.
[26]
 
The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an Indenture (the "Base Indenture"), dated June 26, 2008, by and among the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented and amended by the Third Supplemental Indenture (herein so called), the Fourth Supplemental Indenture (herein so called) and the Fifth Supplemental Indenture (herein so called and, together with the Third Supplemental Indenture and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, the "Supplemental Indentures"), each dated June 2, 2011, establishing the forms and terms of the Notes. The Base Indenture, as so supplemented and amended by the Supplemental Indentures, is referred to as the "Indenture."
 
 
We have examined and relied upon originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of (i) the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as amended through the date hereof, (ii) certain resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company relating to the registration of the Notes and related matters, (iii) certain resolutions adopted by the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, (iv) the Registration Statement, (v) the Prospectus, (vi) the Base Indenture and each of the Supplemental Indentures, (vii) the Underwriting Agreement and (viii) such other certificates, instruments and documents as we consider appropriate for purposes of the opinions hereafter expressed. In addition, we reviewed such questions of law as we considered appropriate.
 
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth herein, we are of the opinion that, assuming the Notes have been duly authenticated by the Trustee and paid for by the Underwriters as contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
 
The opinion expressed herein is qualified in the following respects:
 
A.            As to any facts material to the opinion contained herein, we have made no independent investigation of such facts and have relied, to the extent that we deem such reliance proper, upon certificates of public officials and officers or other representatives of the Company.
 
B.           We have assumed that (i) all information contained in all documents submitted to us for review is accurate and complete, (ii) all signatures on all documents examined by us are genuine, (iii) all documents submitted to us as originals are originals and all documents submitted to us as copies conform to the originals of those documents, (iv) each certificate from governmental officials reviewed by us is accurate, complete and authentic and all public records are accurate and complete, (v) each natural person signing any document has the legal capacity to do so, (vi) each person signing in a representative capacity any document reviewed by us had the legal capacity to do so and (vii) all Notes will be issued and sold in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and in the manner stated in the Prospectus and the Underwriting Agreement.
 
C.            The opinion expressed herein is limited in all respects to the federal laws of the United States of America, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Constitution of the State of Delaware (including all applicable statutory provisions and reported judicial decisions interpreting those laws) and the laws of the State of New York, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction, domestic or foreign.
D.            The opinion is qualified to the extent that the enforceability of any document, instrument or security may be limited by or subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, and general equitable or public policy principles.
 
E.             We express no opinions concerning (i) the validity or enforceability of any provisions contained in the Indenture or the Notes that purport to waive or not give effect to rights to notices, defenses, subrogation or other rights or benefits that cannot be effectively waived under applicable law or (ii) the enforceability of indemnification provisions to the extent they purport to relate to liabilities resulting from or based upon negligence or any violation of federal or state securities or blue sky laws.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion of counsel as Exhibit 5.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K of the Company dated on or about the date hereof, to the incorporation by reference of this opinion of counsel into the Registration Statement and to the reference to our Firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement and the Prospectus. In giving such consent, we do not admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission issued thereunder.
