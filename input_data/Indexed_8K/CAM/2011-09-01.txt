Closing of the purchase of LeTourneau is expected to occur during the 4 quarter of 2011. The entire Agreement, by and among the Company, LeTourneau Technologies, Inc. (LTI) and Joy Global Inc. is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
th
Each of the parties to the Agreement has made certain customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Agreement.

The Agreement contains certain representations, warranties and covenants of the Company and Joy Global that were made for the principal purpose of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those generally applicable to investors.  Accordingly, investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.  Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Agreement, and may not be fully reflected in the Companys subsequent public disclosures to the extent such information is not required to be disclosed.

The forward-looking statements in this press release are based on our current expectations and are made only as of the date of this press release. In addition, certain market outlook information is based on third-party sources that we cannot independently verify, but that we believe reliable. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect new information. We cannot assure you the projected results or events will be achieved. Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, they are subject to change at any time. Such risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, include, but are not limited to overall demand for, and pricing of, the Companys products; the size and timing of orders; the Companys ability to successfully execute the large subsea and drilling systems projects it has been awarded; the possibility of cancellations of orders; the Companys ability to convert backlog into revenues on a timely and profitable basis; the impact of acquisitions the Company has made or may make; changes in the price of (and demand for) oil and gas in both domestic and international markets; raw material costs and availability; political and social issues affecting the countries in which the Company does business; fluctuations in currency markets worldwide; and variations in global economic activity.  In particular, current and projected oil and gas prices historically have generally directly affected customers spending levels and their related purchases of the Companys products and services.  Additionally, changes in oil and gas price expectations may impact the Companys financial results due to changes it may make in its cost structure, staffing or spending levels.
