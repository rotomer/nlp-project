On February 2, 2012, Cameron International Corporation (Cameron) issued a press release announcing its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011.  The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated by reference into this item.
 
 
(d)  Exhibits.
 
    The following is being furnished as an exhibit to this report:
Exhibit 99.1 to this report contains non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The non-GAAP financial measures reflect earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense (EBITDA) and adjusted EPS.  A reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (GAAP) is included as an attachment to the press release.  The Company believes the presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EPS are useful to the Companys investors because (i) EBITDA is an appropriate measure of evaluating the Companys operating performance and liquidity that reflects the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the business, strengthening the balance sheet, repurchasing the Companys securities and making strategic acquisitions and (ii) adjusted EPS is useful in analyzing the Companys on-going earnings potential and understanding certain significant items impacting the comparability of our results.  In addition, EBITDA and adjusted EPS are widely used benchmarks in the investment community.
 
The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Companys financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

CAMERON FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS $0.77 PER SHARE, EXCLUDING CHARGES
HOUSTON (February 2, 2012)  Cameron (NYSE: CAM) reported net income of $99.9 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2011, compared with net income in the prior years fourth quarter of $164.6 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. The fourth quarter 2011 results include after-tax charges of $90.5 million, or $0.37 per share, primarily related to the Deepwater Horizon matter.  The fourth quarter 2010 results included after-tax charges of $6.2 million, or $0.03 per share, primarily related to costs associated with Deepwater Horizon and the continued integration of the NATCO Group Inc. Excluding the above items, the Companys earnings per diluted share were $0.77 for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $0.69 for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Revenues up 12 percent for quarter, 13 percent for year; both represent new highs
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2011 were a record $2.03 billion, up more than 12 percent from the prior year, and revenues for the year were $6.96 billion, up more than 13 percent from 2010s $6.13 billion, also a new record. Excluding charges, earnings per diluted share for 2011 were $2.67, compared to $2.42 for 2010. Including charges, earnings per diluted share were $2.09 for 2011 and $2.27 for 2010.
Cameron Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Jack B. Moore commented that each segment saw record revenues in 2011 reflecting the investments Cameron has made in each of its businesses over the last three years.
Record orders; backlog nearly $6.0 billion at year-end
Orders booked in the fourth quarter of 2011 totaled $1.91 billion, up from $1.71 billion a year ago. Year-over-year orders were higher in all three of the Companys operating segments.  Full-year orders totaled $7.83 billion, up 35 percent from 2010, and represented the highest order year in the Companys history.
 
 
 
Moore noted that record annual orders in Drilling and Surface Systems drove the year-over-year improvement in Drilling & Production Systems (DPS), while each of Valves & Measurements (V&M) businesses saw record annual orders. Moore said, The Process & Compression (PCS) segment saw record orders in the fourth quarter, as well as on an annual level, and added, We continue to be pleased with the balance in our business lines and the opportunities that our diverse product offerings provide.
Cash flow to improve, capital spending to increase in 2012
Camerons cash flow from operations totaled $329 million in the fourth quarter.  Moore said, Cameron invested over $600 million in working capital in 2011 to help support the record sales and orders we experienced in 2011, but we expect this build to moderate significantly in 2012.
We spent $388 million in capital expenditures during the year, Moore said, with an emphasis on enhancing our aftermarket reach and capability and meeting demands in unconventional drilling.  Moore added that he expects Camerons capital spending to increase to approximately $500 million during 2012, saying, We see a mix of needs and opportunities for our businesses during the year that could push our capital expenditures to a new record. The majority will be targeted at expanding our infrastructure in Brazil, growing our aftermarket support bases for Drilling in the North Sea and Far East and adding to Camerons global fleet of equipment and services in the unconventional shale markets.
2012 earnings expected to reach $3.20 to $3.30 per share
Moore said Cameron currently expects its 2012 earnings to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.30 per diluted share, excluding charges, and first quarter 2012 earnings, excluding charges, are expected to be approximately $0.50 to $0.55 per diluted share.

In addition to the historical data contained herein, this document includes forward-looking statements regarding future order levels, working capital needs, revenues and earnings of the Company (including first quarter and full year 2012 earnings per share estimates), as well as expectations regarding facility expansion, the Companys ability to control raw material, overhead and operating costs, capital spending and cash flow, made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  The Companys actual results may differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements.  Such statements are based on current expectations of the Companys performance and are subject to a variety of factors, some of which are not under the control of the Company, which can affect the Companys results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.  Such factors may include overall demand for, and pricing of, the Companys products; the size and timing of orders; the Companys ability to successfully execute deliveries, particularly with respect to the large subsea and drilling systems projects it has been awarded; the possibility of cancellation of orders in backlog; the Companys ability to convert backlog into revenues on a timely and profitable basis; the impact of acquisitions the Company has made or may make; changes in the price of (and demand for) oil and gas in both domestic and international markets; raw material costs and availability; political and social issues affecting the countries in which the Company does business, including the ability of companies to obtain drilling permits following the lifting of a temporary moratorium imposed by the United States government on drilling activities in deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico; fluctuations in currency markets worldwide; and variations in global economic activity.  In particular, current and projected oil and gas prices historically have generally directly affected customers spending levels and their related purchases of the Companys products and services.  Additionally, changes in oil and gas price expectations may impact the Companys financial results due to changes in cost structure, staffing or spending levels.

Because the information herein is based solely on data currently available, it is subject to change as a result of changes in conditions over which the Company has no control or influence, and should not therefore be viewed as assurance regarding the Companys future performance.
