The term "Related Person" shall mean any individual, corporation, partnership or other person or entity other than the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries which, as of the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote on any Business Combination, or immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction, together with its "Affiliates" and "Associates" (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as in effect on the date of the approval and adoption of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation by the stockholders of the Corporation (collectively and as so in effect, the "Exchange Act")), are "Beneficial Owners" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) in the aggregate of twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Corporation, and such term shall also include any Affiliate or Associate of any such individual, corporation, partnership or other person or entity.

has the right to acquire pursuant to any agreement, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants or options, or otherwise, shall be deemed beneficially owned by the Related Person.

2
/

2
/
3
) of the Continuing Directors and such amendment, change or repeal so recommended shall require only the vote, if any, required under the applicable provisions of the GCL and of this Certificate of Incorporation. For the purposes of this Article FIFTH only, if at the time when any such amendment, change, or repeal is under consideration there is no proposed Business Combination (in which event, the definition of Continuing Director in paragraph B(v) of this Article FIFTH would be inapplicable), the "Continuing Directors" shall be deemed to be those persons who are members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation at the time when this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was approved and adopted by the stockholders plus those persons who are Continuing Directors under paragraph B(v) of this Article FIFTH.

Any director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for a term expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office.
 
B. Any amendment, change or repeal of this Article SIXTH, or any other amendment of this Certificate of Incorporation which would have the effect of modifying or permitting circumvention of this Article SIXTH, shall require the favorable vote, at a meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, of the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation entitled to vote.

Except as otherwise required by law, or as provided in the terms of any series of Preferred Stock, any or all of the directors of the Corporation may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, considered for purposes of this Article SEVENTH as one class.
 
B. Any amendment, change or repeal of this Article SEVENTH, or any other amendment of this Certificate of Incorporation which would have the effect of modifying or permitting circumvention of this Article SEVENTH, shall require the favorable vote, at a meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, of the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation entitled to vote.

TWELFTH: A. Subject to paragraph C of this Article TWELFTH, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the
 
Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
 
B. Subject to paragraph C of this Article TWELFTH, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
 
C. Any indemnification under this Article TWELFTH (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraph A or B of this Article TWELFTH, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (a) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (b) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (c) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a present or former director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraph A or B of this Article TWELFTH, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
 
D. Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under paragraph C of this Article TWELFTH, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any present or former director or officer of the Corporation may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under paragraphs A and B of this Article TWELFTH. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of such person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in paragraph A or B of this Article TWELFTH, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under paragraph C of this Article TWELFTH nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that such person seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this paragraph D of this Article TWELFTH shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, such person seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.
 
E. Expenses incurred by a person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation in defending or investigating a threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person
 
to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article TWELFTH.
 
F. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article TWELFTH shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in paragraphs A and B of this Article TWELFTH shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article TWELFTH shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in paragraph A or B of this Article TWELFTH but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the GCL, or otherwise.
 
G. For purposes of this Article TWELFTH, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article TWELFTH with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Article TWELFTH, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such person with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article TWELFTH. For purposes of any determination under paragraph C of this Article TWELFTH, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to him by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this paragraph G of this Article TWELFTH shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this paragraph G of this Article TWELFTH shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs A or B of this Article TWELFTH, as the case may be.
 
H. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article TWELFTH shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
 
I. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article TWELFTH to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by paragraph D of this Article TWELFTH), the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
 
J. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those conferred in this Article TWELFTH to directors and officers of the Corporation.
 
K. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute:
 
(i)
           
the Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article TWELFTH or Section 145 of the GCL; and
 
(ii)
          
the Corporation may create a trust fund, grant a security interest and/or use other means (including, without limitation, letters of credit, surety bonds and/or other similar arrangements), as well as enter into contracts providing indemnification to the full extent authorized or permitted by law and including as part thereof provisions with respect to any or all of the foregoing to ensure the payment of such amounts as may become necessary to affect indemnification as provided therein, or elsewhere.
 
L. No amendment or repeal of this Article TWELFTH shall apply to or have any effect on any right to indemnification provided hereunder with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
 
THIRTEENTH: No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty by such a director as a director to the full extent authorized or permitted by law (as now or hereafter in effect). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, a director shall be liable to the extent provided by applicable law (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the GCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which such director derived an improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal of this Article THIRTEENTH shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
 
FOURTEENTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, a majority of the entire Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, repeal, alter or amend the Bylaws of the Corporation. In addition, the Bylaws of the Corporation may be adopted, repealed, altered or amended by the favorable vote of two-thirds (
2
/
3
) of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, unless a higher vote is expressly required by the Bylaws for the adoption, repeal, alteration or amendment of any provision thereof.
 
FIFTEENTH: The Corporation reserves the right to repeal, alter, amend or rescind any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred on stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
