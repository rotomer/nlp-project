FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Due to lower industry demand for heavy-duty truck engines, Caterpillar's engine division will implement a series of manufacturing shut downs and employee layoffs in the fourth quarter. The reductions will impact Caterpillar's Mossville, Ill. Engine Center, the Mapleton, Ill. foundry and the company's Fuel Systems facilities in Pontiac, Ill., Jefferson, Ga. and Thomasville, Ga.
temporary
Up to 3,270 management, salaried and manufacturing employees will be affected at this time.Included in this figure are 470 full-time hourly employees whose layoffs were previously announced on September 6, 2002. These actions are consistent with other cost reduction efforts the company is pursuing.
Eligible Caterpillar employees, in addition to unemployment insurance, will receive company benefits designed to ease the burden of layoff. Caterpillar is making every effort to minimize any hardship our employees and their families may experience during this difficult time.
