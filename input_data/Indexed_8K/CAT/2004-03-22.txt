This filing on Form 8-K is submitted to clarify the Board of Directors' intent with respect to the Caterpillar Inc. 1996 Stock Option and Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan") described and included in the company's proxy statement filed on February 24, 2004. The Board intends that the annual pool of restricted stock available to be granted under the Plan be limited to a maximum of 250,000 per year for the three years remaining before the Plan expires in 2006. The aggregate total of shares available for restricted stock grants under the Plan shall not exceed 750,000. The Company will modify the Plan to reflect this intent as soon as practicable.
