PEORIA, Ill. -- Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) Chairman and CEO Jim Owens confirmed the company's expectation of continued growth while speaking to about 60 financial analysts attending MINExpo, the world's leading mining exposition sponsored by the National Mining Association and held at the Las Vegas Convention Center.
"
Our goal is to continue growing the business with emphasis on improved profitability. Sales growth by itself isn't good enough. We want profitable growth that enables us to continually develop leading edge products, maintain world-class operations, pay highly competitive salaries and benefits to attract and retain the best people, and increase dividends for stockholderseverything to make this a great company," Owens said.
 
Owens said the company is committed to satisfying continued unprecedented customer demand, despite incurring additional costs to respond to this steep upturn in key markets. Retail sales figures issued September 17, 2004 show continued strength in worldwide machine and engine sales, driven by significant increases in North and South America.
Despite the fact that cost pressures have materialized this year, Owens outlined steps the company is taking to become more efficient in what he expects to be a continued strong business environment. He assured analysts that costs continue to receive scrutiny and plans are in place to manage them through the rapid upturn, including working closely with the company's suppliers to reduce expediting costs, surcharges and costly supply shortages.
Owens updated the company's 2004 outlook issued July 22, 2004. The company now
expects 2004 sales and revenues to be up 25 to 30 percent and profit per share to still increase 80 to 85 percent compared to 2003.
Caterpillar
reported 2003 sales and revenues of $22.76 billion and 2003 profit of $1.1 billion or $3.13 per share
.
Based on a preliminary outlook, Owens said the company expects its 2005
sales and revenues to be up about 10 percent from 2004
 
with record profit per share.
"I'm confident our leadership team will excel during this period of strong demand by focusing on the fundamentals of customer satisfaction and sound cost management," Owens summarized.
Caterpillar will release its third-quarter results October 21, 2004.
