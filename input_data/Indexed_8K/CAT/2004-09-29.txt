ITEM: Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On September 23, 2004, Caterpillar entered into a 5 year Credit Agreement ("Five Year Facility") among Caterpillar Inc., Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation, Caterpillar International Finance p.l.c., and Caterpillar Finance Corporation ("Borrowers"), certain financial institutions named therein ("Banks"), Citibank, N.A., ("Agent"), Citibank International plc ("Local Currency Agent"), The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. ("Japan Local Currency Agent"), ABN AMRO Bank N.V., Bank of America, National Association J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Societe Generale and WESTLB AG, New York Branch ("Arrangers") and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("Lead Arranger and Sole Book Manager").
The Five Year Facility has a committed capacity of $2.5 billion that is comprised of commitments from 22 financial institutions. Caterpillar Inc. and the named subsidiaries borrow money by issuing commercial paper. Buyers of commercial paper want assurance that the company has alternative sources of funds so the commercial paper can be repaid at maturity. This Facility serves as a back stop to the commercial paper program and provides this assurance. Caterpillar has never drawn against the Facility.
Two Addendums were added because Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation ("CFSC") is operating in various foreign countries. To match fund their receivables, CFSC has several foreign currency commercial paper programs in several currencies. To back stop each of these commercial paper programs, CFSC has a sub-facility in the same currency. The Caterpillar International Finance p.l.c. ("CIF") Local Currency Addendum enables CIF to borrow in certain non-U.S. dollar currencies. The Caterpillar Finance Corporation ("CFC") Japan Local Currency Addendum enables CFC to borrow yen for amounts up to the equivalent of US$100 million.

(c)  
Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the time of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Agent such Bank's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this
Section 2.02

Defaulting Bank"
) and such Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Revolving Credit Advances comprising such Revolving Credit Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Defaulting Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Defaulting Bank shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, together with interest thereon as required in the immediately preceding sentence, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Revolvi ng Credit Advance as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement and such Bank shall be entitled to all rights in respect of such Revolving Credit Advance, including the right to receive interest from the date funds in connection therewith shall have been made available to such Borrower. If such Borrower shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such repayment shall not relieve the Defaulting Bank from its obligation to make its ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing available to such Borrower. Nothing contained herein shall impair the right of such Borrower to the performance by any Bank of such Bank's obligations hereunder.

(b)  
Each of Caterpillar and CFSC shall pay to the Agent, for the account of each Bank, a fee (each a "

" and collectively, the "
Facility Fees
") calculated on a daily basis by multiplying the Facility Fee Rate in effect on each day by the amount of such Bank's Allocated Commitment for such Borrower as in effect on such d ay (without regard to the actual or deemed usage of such Allocated Commitment) and payable quarterly in arrears, commencing on January 3, 2005, for the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2004, inclusive, on the first Business Day of each calendar quarter thereafter for the period of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, and on the Termination Date for the period since the last payment of Facility Fees.

provided
,

, that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof.
Any such reduction of each Bank's Commitment will be an automatic reduction of such Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment in an identical amount.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the acquisition of one Bank by another Bank, or the merger, consolidation or other combination of any two or more Banks (any such acquisition, merger, consolidation or other combination being referred to hereinafter as a "
Combination
" and each Bank which is a party to such Combination being hereinafter referred to as a "
Combined Bank
"), the Borrowers may notify the Agent that they desire to reduce the Commitment of the Bank surviving such Combination (the "
Surviving Bank

Surviving Commitment
" and the Commitments of the other Combined Banks being hereinafter referred to, collectively, as the "
Retired Commitments
"). If the Majority Banks (determined as set forth below) and the Agent agree to such reduction in the Surviving Bank's Commitment, then (i) the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall be reduced by the Retired Commitments effective upon the effective date of the Combination,

For purposes of this
Section 2.05(b)
, Majority Banks shall be determined as if the reduction in the aggregate amount of the Commitments requested by the Borrowers had occurred (
i.e.
, the Combined Banks shall be deemed to have a single Commitment equal to the Surviving Commitment and the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall be deemed to have been reduced by the Retired Commitments).
 
(c)  
The Borrowers shall have the right, upon at least five (5) Business Days' notice to the Agent, to add one or more bank or banks as new Banks hereunder, or to increase the Commitment of any existing Bank with such existing Bank's consent, pursuant to the terms hereof (any such addition of a new Bank or increase in the Commitment of an existing Bank upon the request of the Borrowers pursuant to this
Section
 
2.05(c)

Bank Addition
");
provided
that (i) such proposed Bank, in the case of a bank not already a Bank hereunder, is acceptable to the Agent (the consent of the Agent not to be unreasonably withheld); (ii) after giving effect to the proposed Bank Addition, no Bank's Commitment would exceed 20% of the Total Commitment; and (iii) after giving effect to the proposed Bank Addition, the Total Commitment would not exceed 120% of the Total Commitment on the Closing Date.

Exhibit B-5
hereto, specifying therein (i) the name and address of the proposed Added Bank, (ii) the date on which the Borrowers wish such Bank Addition to become effective, and (iii) the amount of the Commitment such Added Bank would have hereunder after giving effect to such Bank Addition. If the conditions set forth in the proviso contained in the first sentence of this
Section 2.05(c)
have been satisfied, the Agent shall forward to such Added Bank and the Borrowers for execution by such Added Bank and the Borrowers an Assumption and Acceptance. The Added Bank shall, upon such execution, return the executed Assumption and Acceptance to the Agent, for the Agent's acceptance thereof, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500.
 
Upon such execution, delivery and acceptance, from and after the effective date specified in each Assumption and Acceptance, the Added Bank shall, in addition to the rights and obligations hereunder held by it immediately prior to such effective date (if any), have the rights and obligations hereunder that have been assumed by it pursuant to such Assumption and Acceptance and, in the case of a bank not previously a Bank hereunder, shall become a Bank hereunder.
 
By executing and delivering an Assumption and Acceptance, each Added Bank confirms to and agrees with each party hereto as follows: (i) neither the Agent nor any Bank makes any representation or warranty, nor assumes any responsibility with respect to, any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (ii) neither the Agent nor any Bank makes any representation or warranty, nor assumes any responsibility with respect to, the financial condition of any Borrower or the performance or observance by any Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto.

Section 8.02
a copy of each Assumption and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it. Such copies shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
 
Upon its receipt of an Assumption and Acceptance executed by an Added Bank and the Borrowers the Agent shall, if such Assumption and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of
Exhibit C-1
hereto, (i) accept such Assumption and Acceptance, and (ii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrowers.

Such new Note or Notes shall be dated the effective date of such Assumption and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of
Exhibit A
hereto.

If there are any Revolving Credit Advances outstanding on the effective date of any Assumption and Acceptance, the Added Bank shall purchase from the other Banks such participations in such Revolving Credit Advances as shall be necessary to cause such Added Bank to share ratably (based on the proportion that such Added Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment bears to the Total Revolving Credit Commitment after giving effect to the Bank Addition) in each such Revolving Credit Advance. To purchase such participations, the Added Bank shall before 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the effective date of its Assumption and Acceptance, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at its address r eferred to in
Section 8.02

After the Agent's receipt of such funds, the Agent will promptly make such same day funds available to the account of each Bank in an amount to such Bank's ratable portion of such pay ment by the Added Bank. In addition, if such Added Bank acquires a Japan Local Currency Commitment or a Local Currency Commitment, automatically upon and simultaneously with becoming an Added Bank, such Added Bank shall have acquired a ratable risk participation in all then outstanding Local Currency Advances or Japan Local Currency Advances, as applicable, with such ratable risk participation based on such Added Bank's Local Currency Commitment or Japan Local Currency Commitment as a fraction of the aggregate of all Local Currency Commitments or Japan Local Currency Commitments, as applicable.

SECTION 2.09.
Prepayments of Advances
.
 
(a)  Any Borrower may, upon at least two (2) Business Days' notice to the Agent stating (i) the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment and (ii) the Advances (which shall be part of the same Borrowing) to which such prepayment is to be applied, and if such notice is given such Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid;
provided
,
however
, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal Dollar Amount of not less than $10,000,000 and in an integral Dollar Amount multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) in the case of any such prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Advance or a TIBO Rate Advance, such Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the applicable Banks in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 8.04(b)
.
 
(b)

Section 2.15
(each such date, a "
Computation Date
"), it is determined that as a result of currency fluctuations with respect to the Advances to which such Computation Date applies, the aggregate Dollar Amount of (x) all outstanding Advances exceeds the Total Commitment, or (y) all outstanding Revolving Credit Obligations exceeds the Total Revolving Credit Commitment, the Borrowers shall on such date prepay an aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Advances ratably to the Banks in an amount equal to or, at the option of the Borrowers, greater than such excess, with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid. The Borrowers may determine which Borrowing such prepayment shall be allocated to, and any such prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be subject to the provisions of
Section 8.04(b)

SECTION 2.10.
Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy; Illegality
.
 
(a)  If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, to the extent
 
already included in the Eurocurrency Rate Reserve Percentage) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase
 
in the cost to any Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Advances or TIBO Rate Advances, then the applicable Borrower shall from time to time, upon demand
 
by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increased cost. A certificate describing in reasonable detail the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrowers and the Agent by such Bank, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. If any such increase in cost is attributable to specific Advances made to a particular
 
Borrower, compensation for such increased cost shall be paid by such Borrower (or if
 
such Borrower is CIF or CFC, by CFSC). In all other cases, compensation for such increased cost shall be paid by Caterpillar.
 
(b)  
If any Bank determines that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Bank or by any Person controlling such Bank and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Bank's Advances or commitment to lend hereunder, then, upon demand by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the applicable Borrower shall immediately pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank, from time to time as specified by such Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank (o r, if applicable, such Person controlling such Bank) in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Bank reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Bank's commitment to lend hereunder. A certificate describing in reasonable detail such amounts submitted to the applicable Borrower by such Bank shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. If any such increase in capital is attributable to specific Advances made to a particular Borrower or to the Allocated Commitments to a particular Borrower or Borrowers, compensation for such increase in capital shall be paid by such Borrower (or if such Borrower is CIF or CFC, by CFSC). In all other cases, compensation for such increased capital shall be paid by Caterpillar.
 
(c)  
If any Bank shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Local Currency Advances, TIBO Rate Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Local Currency Advances, TIBO Rate Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances hereunder, (i) all Local Currency Advances, TIBO Rate Advances and Eurocurrency Rate Advances of such Bank to any Borrower then outstanding shall be converted into Dollars and begin bearing interest at the Base Rate (or in the case of T IBO Rate Advances, be maintained in Japanese Yen but begin bearing interest at the Japan Base Rate) for the Interest Period selected by such Borrower in accordance with the procedures of
Section 2.02(a)
or
Section 2.03(a)
, notwithstanding any prior election by such Borrower to the contrary, either (x) one Business Day after such notice, or (y) if such Bank may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Advances at the applicable Eurocurrency Rate or TIBO Rate to a later day during such Interest Period, on such later day (in which case such Borrower shall in addition reimburse such Bank for any resulting losses as provided in
Section 8.04(b)
) and (ii) the obligation of such Bank to make Local Currency Advances, TIBO Rate Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, as applicable, shall be suspended until such Bank shall notify the Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and until such notification has been given (i) in the case of Local Currency Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, such Bank shall fund its Local Currency Advance made in connection with each Local Currency Borrowing and Revolving Credit Advance made in connection with each Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances as a Base Rate Advance, and (ii) in the case of a Japan Local Currency Advance, the Japan Local Currency Banks shall fund each Japan Local Currency Borrowing with Japan Base Rate Advances.
 
(d) 
If the Majority Banks (or the Majority Local Currency Banks) shall, at least one Business Day before the date of any requested Revolving Credit Borrowing or Local Currency Borrowing (or on the date of such Local Currency Borrowing, in the case of a Same Day Local Currency Borrowing), notify the Agent that the Eurocurrency Rate for Eurocurrency Rate Advances comprising such Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Banks (or the Majority Local Currency Banks) of making or funding their respective Eurocurrency Rate Advances for such Revolving Credit Borrowing or Local Currency Borrowing, the right of the requesting Borrower to select the Eurocurrency Rate for such Borrowing, and the right of any Borrower to select the Eurocurrency Rate for any subsequent Borrowing, shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a Base Rate Advance.
 
(e) 
If the Majority Japan Local Currency Banks shall, at least one Business Day before the date of any requested Japan Local Currency Borrowing (or on the date of such Borrowing if it is being requested on a same-day basis), notify the Japan Local Currency Agent that the TIBO Rate for TIBO Rate Advances comprising such Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Japan Local Currency Banks of making or funding their respective TIBO Rate Advances for such Japan Local Currency Borrowing, the right of CFC to select the TIBO Rate for such Borrowing, and the right of CFC to select the TIBO Rate for any subsequent Borrowing, shall be suspended until the Japan Local Currency Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Jap an Local Currency Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a Japan Base Rate Advance.
 
(f) 
In the event that a Bank (an "
Affected Bank

Section 2.10
, then from such time and for so long thereafter as such Bank remains an Affected Bank, the Borrowers may either (1) terminate such Affected Bank's Commitment hereunder or (2) replace such Affected Bank with another bank or banks acceptable to the Agent (the consent of the Agent not to be unreasonably withheld);
provided
that (i) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time and (ii) the Affected Bank and the replacement bank(s) execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance and such other documents, agreements and instruments as the Agent may reasonably require in order to effectuate the assumption by such replacement bank(s) of the Affected Bank's obligations hereunder. In no event shall the replacement of an Affected Bank impair or otherwise affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower or Borrowers to make the payments demanded by such Affected Bank pursuant to this
Section 2.10< /U>
and, if applicable,
Section 8.04(b)
.

provided
,
however
, if such extension would cause paymen t of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Advances or TIBO Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day and such contraction of time shall in such case reduce the days included in the computation of payment of interest.
 
(d)  
Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank.

Bank in the Original Currency, the Agent or such Bank, as applicable, agrees to remit to the applicable Borrower or Borrowers such excess.

Accordingly, when any Borrower opens an account, the Agent and the Banks will ask for the Borrower's name, tax identification number (if applicable), business address, and other information that will allow the Agent and the Banks to identify such Borrower. The Agent and the Banks may also ask to see such Borrower's legal organizational documents or other identifying documents.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am [General Counsel/General Attorney] of [Name of Applicable Borrower], a [Type of Organization] (the "Borrower"), and give this opinion pursuant to
Section 3.01(d)
of the Credit Agreement (Five Year Facility) dated as of September 23, 2004 (the "Credit Agreement"), among the Borrower, [names of other Borrowers under the Credit Agreement], the Banks parties thereto, Citibank International plc, as Local Currency Agent, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., as Japan Local Currency Agent, and Citibank, N.A., as Agent for said Banks. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
 
I have examined the Credit Agreement; [the Local Currency Addendum;] [the Japan Local Currency Addendum;] the documents furnished by the Borrower pursuant to
Article III
of the Credit Agreement; the [Certificate of Incorporation] of the Borrower and all amendments thereto (the "Charter"); and the [bylaws] of the Borrower and all amendments thereto (the "Bylaws"). In addition, I have examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Borrower, certificates of public officials, and agreements, instruments and other documents, and have conducted such other investigations o f fact and law, as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.
 
In rendering my opinion, I have assumed the due authorization, execution and delivery of each document referred to herein by all parties to such document other than the Borrower.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the comments and qualifications set forth below, it is my opinion that:
 
1.  
The Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the [INSERT APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION] and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in every jurisdiction in which failure to qualify may materially adversely affect (i) the financial condition or operations of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of the Borrower to perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement [, the Local Currency Addendum] [, the Japan Local Currency Addendum]
22
 
and its Notes.
 
2. 
The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement [, the Local Currency Addendum] [,the Japan Local Currency Addendum]
23
 
and the Notes to be executed by it are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene, or constitute a default under (i) the Charter or the Bylaws or (ii) any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower or (iii) any material agreement, judgment, injunction, order , decree or other material instrument binding upon the Borrower.
 
3. 
No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement [, the Local Currency Addendum] [, the Japan Local Currency Addendum]
24
 
and the Notes to be executed by it.
 
4. 
The Credit Agreement [, the Local Currency Addendum] [, the Japan Local Currency Addendum]
25
 
and its Notes have been duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of the Borrower. Assuming that the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, and each Bank party to the Credit Agreement as of the date hereof have duly executed and delivered the Credit Agreement and that each such Bank has notified the Agent that such Bank has executed the Credit Agreement, [, and assu ming that (x) the Local Currency Agent and each Local Currency Bank party to the Local Currency Addendum as of the date hereof have duly executed and delivered the Local Currency Addendum and that each such Local Currency Bank has notified the Agent that such Local Currency Bank has executed the Local Currency Addendum, and (y) the Japan Local Currency Agent and each Japan Local Currency Bank party to the Japan Local Currency Addendum as of the date hereof have duly executed and delivered the Japan Local Currency Addendum and that each such Japan Local Currency Bank has notified the Agent that such Japan Local Currency Bank has executed the Japan Local Currency Addendum] the Credit Agreement is, [the Local Currency Addendum is,] [the Japan Local Currency Addendum is,] the Notes executed and delivered by the Borrower on or prior to the date hereof are, and any other Notes when executed and delivered by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement will be, the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms, except as enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and by the effect of general principles of equity.
 
5. 
There is no pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened action or proceeding affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator, which purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement [, the Local Currency Addendum,][,the Japan Local Currency Addendum,] or any Note or which is reasonably likely to materially adversely affect (i) the financial condition or operations of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of the Borrower to perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement [, the Local Currency Addendum,][,the Japan Local Currency Addendum] and the Notes to be executed by it.
 
I express no opinion as to (i)
Sections 2.13
and
8.05
of the Credit Agreement, insofar as they provide that any Bank purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant thereto to may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any affiliate of a Bank may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such Bank's claims under the Credit Agreement or the Notes or (ii)
Section 2.12(c)
,
7.05
or
8.04(c)
, to the extent that any such section may be construed as requiring indemnification with respect to a claim, damage, liability or expense incurred as a result of any violation of law by a Bank, the Agent [or the Local Currency Agent][or the Japan Local Currency Agent].
 
I am qualified to practice law in the State of [_______] and do not purport to be an expert on, or to express any opinion concerning, any laws other than the law of the State of [_______], the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal law of the United States. Insofar as the opinions expressed in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above relate to matters which are governed by the laws of the State of New York, I have assumed for purposes of rendering such opinions that the applicable laws of the State of New York are substantially identical to the laws of the State of [_______].
 
This opinion is limited to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly set forth herein. The opinions expressed herein are being delivered to you as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and are solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and may not be relied on in any manner or for any purpose by any other Person, nor any copies published, communicated or otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other Person without my specific prior written consent, except that you may furnish copies thereof (i) to any of your permitted successors and assigns in respect of the Credit Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum and the Notes, (ii) to your independent auditors and attorneys, (iii) upon the request of any state or federal authority or official having regulatory jurisdiction over you, and (iv) pursuant to order or legal process of any court or governmental agency.

To the Banks listed on Exhibit A
hereto and to Citibank, N.A.,
as Agent, Citibank International plc, as
Local Currency Agent, and The
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., as
Japan Local Currency Agent
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special New York counsel to Citibank, N.A. ("Citibank"), individually and as Agent, in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement (Five Year Facility) dated as of September 23, 2004 ("Credit Agreement"), among the Borrowers, each of you, Citibank International plc, as Local Currency Agent, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., as Japan Local Currency Agent, and Citibank, as Agent for the Banks. Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
 
In that connection, we have examined the following documents:
 
(1) 
Counterparts of the Credit Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, and the Japan Local Currency Addendum, executed by each of the parties thereto.
 
(2) 
The documents furnished by the Borrowers to the Agent listed on Exhibit B hereto, including the opinions of internal counsel for each of Caterpillar Inc. ("Caterpillar") and Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation ("CFSC").
 
In our examination of the documents referred to above, we have assumed the authenticity of all such documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures, the due authority of the parties executing such documents, and the conformity to the originals of all such documents submitted to us as copies. We have also assumed that each of the Banks, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent and the Agent have duly executed and delivered the Credit Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum and the Japan Local Currency Addendum, as applicable, with all necessary power and authority (corporate and otherwise).
 
To the extent that our opinions expressed below involve conclusions as to the matters set forth in the opinions of counsel referred to in item (2) above, we have assumed without independent investigation the correctness of the matters set forth therein.
 
Based upon the foregoing examination of documents and assumptions and upon such other investigation as we have deemed necessary, we are of the following opinion:
 
1. 
The Credit Agreement is, and the Notes executed by each of Caterpillar and CFSC and delivered on or prior to the date hereof are, the legal, valid and binding obligations of each of Caterpillar and CFSC, respectively, enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with their respective terms, the Local Currency Addendum is the legal, valid and binding obligation of CFSC, enforceable against CFSC in accordance with its terms, and the Japan Local Currency Addendum is the legal, valid and binding obligation of CFSC, enforceable against CFSC in accordance with, its terms.
 
2. 
The opinions and other documents referred to in item (2) above are substantially responsive to the requirements of the Credit Agreement.
 
Our opinions above are subject to the following qualifications:
 
(a) 
Our opinion in paragraph 1 above is subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing. In applying such principles, a court, among other things, might not allow a creditor to accelerate maturity of a debt upon the occurrence of a default deemed immaterial or might decline to order a debtor to perform covenants. Such principles applied by a court include a requirement that a creditor act with reasonableness and in good faith.
 
(b) 
Our opinion in paragraph 1 above is also subject (i) to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar law affecting creditors' rights generally and (ii) to the effect of any federal or state law, rule or regulation (including any federal or state securities law, rule or regulation) or public policy, to the extent that such law, rule, regulation or public policy limits rights to indemnification.
 
(c) 
Our opinions expressed above are limited to the law of the State of New York and the federal law of the United States, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we express no opinion as to (i) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction, other than the State of New York, wherein any Bank may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum or the Notes may be sought which limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible, or (ii) whether any of the Banks is "doing business" in the State of New York.
 
(d) 
We express no opinion as to the effect of the compliance or noncompliance of the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent or any of the Banks with any state or federal laws or regulations applicable to any such party because of such party's legal or regulatory status, the nature of such party's business or the authority of any party to conduct business in any jurisdiction.
 
(e)  We express no opinion as to (i) Sections 2.13 and 8.05 of the Credit Agreement, or any comparable provisions under the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, insofar as they provide that any Bank purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any affiliate of a Bank may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such Bank's claims under the Credit Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum or the Notes or (ii) Section 2.12(c), 7.05 or 8.04(c), or any comparable provisions of the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, to the extent that any such section or provision may be construed as requiring indemnification wi th respect to a claim, damage, liability or expense incurred as a result of any violation of law by a Bank or the Agent.
 
(f)  We express no opinion as to the legality, validity or enforceability of any of the Credit Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum or the documents listed on Exhibit B with regard to or as against Caterpillar International Finance p.l.c. ("CIF") or Caterpillar Finance Corporation ("CFC"), nor shall any of the opinions contained herein be construed to apply to CIF or CFC.
 
This opinion is limited to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly set forth herein. The opinions expressed herein are being delivered to you as of the date hereof in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and are solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions described hereinabove and may not be relied on in any manner or for any purpose by any other person, nor any copies published, communicated or otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person or entity without our specific prior written consent, except that you may furnish copies thereof (i) to any of your permitted successors and assigns in respect of the Credit Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum and the Notes, (i i) to your independent auditors and attorneys, (iii) upon the request of any state or federal authority or official having regulatory jurisdiction over you, and (iv) pursuant to order or legal process of any court or governmental agency.
