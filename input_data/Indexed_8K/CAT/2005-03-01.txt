In support of our long-term commitment to providing products at optimal customer and shareholder value, Caterpillar has announced a general price increase of 1 to 5 percent for machinery and engines.
This price action, first announced to dealers worldwide this morning, is in line with general economic conditions and industry factors. It will be effective in late spring 2005.
As we have previously stated, our plan is to more than offset material cost increases with price realization in 2005. We are monitoring material costs and their impact on our results and will consider whether an update to our 2005 outlook is appropriate in our first quarter press release, currently scheduled to be issued on April 20, 2005.
