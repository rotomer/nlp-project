Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
On June 2, 2006, Caterpillar Inc. entered into a Credit Agreement ("bridge facility") with Citibank, N.A. Caterpillar entered into the bridge facility for the main purpose of financing its acquisition of Progress Rail Services, Inc. previously announced on May 16, 2006, as well as for other general corporate purposes.
Under the terms of the bridge facility, Caterpillar has the ability to borrow up to $1 billion in exchange for its issuance of commercial paper. This bridge facility is intended to serve as a backstop to Caterpillars commercial paper program. The bridge facility will terminate on September 30, 2006, however, Caterpillar may elect to terminate the facility earlier or engage in other forms of financing to replace the facility.
