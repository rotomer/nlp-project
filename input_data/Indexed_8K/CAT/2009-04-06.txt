(Administrative Agent) that provides for an unsecured aggregate revolving credit facility to the Borrowers of approximately US$1.3 billion (Aggregate Commitment) and expires on March 30, 2010.

The 364-Day Facility is subject to customary conditions precedent and payment of certain facility fees in quarterly arrears. Borrowings under the 364-Day Facility bear interest at an adjusted applicable rate based on specified types of advances (i.e., US Dollar or Euro advances), plus a certain applicable margin.
Some of the Banks, as well as certain of their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform, for the Borrowers, various commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting and other financial advisory services, for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and expenses.
The foregoing description of the 364-Day Facility is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and provisions of the 364-Day Facility filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report, and incorporated herein by reference.

Except for its status as a contractual document that establishes and governs the legal relations among the parties thereto with respect to the transaction described in this Form 8-K, the 364-Day Facility is not intended to be a source of factual, business or operational information about the parties.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the parties in the 364-Day Facility are made and valid as of the execution date of the 364-Day Facility. In addition, certain of the representations and warranties are subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be different from what may be viewed as material to stockholders. Representations and warranties may be used as a tool to allocate risks between the respective parties to the 364-Day Facility, including where the parties do not have complete knowledge of all the facts. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties or any of their affiliates.

Each Bank that elects not to take access to Restricting Information does so voluntarily and, by such election, acknowledges and agrees that the Administrative Agent and other Banks may have access to Restricting Information that is not available to such electing Bank.  None of the Administrative Agent nor any Bank with access to Restricting Information shall have any duty to disclose such Restricting Information to such electing Bank or to use such Restricting Information on behalf of such electing Bank, and shall not be liable for the failure to so disclose or use, such Restricting Information.
 
     (e)  The provisions of the foregoing clauses of this are designed to assist the Administrative Agent, the Banks and the Borrowers, in complying with their respective contractual obligations and applicable law in circumstances where certain Banks express a desire not to receive Restricting Information notwithstanding that certain Communications hereunder or other information provided to the Banks hereunder or thereunder may contain Restricting Information.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties warrants or makes any other statement with respect to the adequacy of such provisions to achieve such purpose nor does the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties warrant or make any other statement to the effect that Borrowers or Banks adherence to such provisions will be sufficient to ensure compliance by such Borrower or Bank with its contractual obligations or its duties under applicable law in respect of Restricting Information and each of the Banks and each Borrower assumes the risks associated therewith.

To each of the Banks parties

Caterpillar Inc., Caterpillar
Financial Services Corporation,
said Banks, and Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent
 
 
Re:  [Name of Applicable Borrower]
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am [General Counsel/General Attorney] of [Name of Applicable Borrower], a [Type of Organization] (the Borrower), and give this opinion pursuant to of the Credit Agreement (364-Day Facility) dated as of March 31, 2009 (the Credit Agreement), among the Borrower, [names of other Borrowers under the Credit Agreement], the Banks parties thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent for said Banks.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
Section 3.01(d)
 
I have examined the Credit Agreement; the documents furnished by the Borrower pursuant to of the Credit Agreement; the [Certificate of Incorporation] of the Borrower and all amendments thereto (the Charter); and the [bylaws] of the Borrower and all amendments thereto (the Bylaws).  In addition, I have examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Borrower, certificates of public officials, and agreements, instruments and other documents, and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law, as I have deemed necessary or advisable for purposes of this opinion.
Article III
 
In rendering my opinion, I have assumed the due authorization, execution and delivery of each document referred to herein by all parties to such document other than the Borrower.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the comments and qualifications set forth below, it is my opinion that:
 
1.  The Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the [INSERT APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION] and is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in every jurisdiction in which failure to qualify may materially adversely affect (i) the financial condition or operations of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of the Borrower to perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Notes.
 
2.  The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes to be executed by it are within the Borrowers corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not contravene, or constitute a default under (i) the Charter or the Bylaws or (ii) in any material respect, any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower or (iii) any material agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or other material instrument binding upon the Borrower.
 
3.  No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required for the due execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes.
 
4.  The Credit Agreement and the Notes have been duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of the Borrower.  Assuming that the Administrative Agent and each Bank party to the Credit Agreement as of the date hereof have duly executed and delivered the Credit Agreement and that each such Bank has notified the Administrative Agent that such Bank has executed the Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement is, the Notes executed and delivered on or prior to the date hereof are, and any other Notes when executed and delivered pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement will be, the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms, except as enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by the effect of general principles of equity.
 
5.  There is no pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened action or proceeding affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator, which purports to affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any Note or which is reasonably likely to materially adversely affect (i) the financial condition or operations of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of the Borrower to perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement  and the Notes.
 
I express no opinion as to (i) and of the Credit Agreement, insofar as they provide that any Bank purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant thereto to may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Affiliate of a Bank may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such Banks claims under the Credit Agreement or the Notes or (ii) , or , to the extent that any such section may be construed as requiring indemnification with respect to a claim, damage, liability or expense incurred as a result of any violation of law by a Bank or the Administrative Agent.

I am qualified to practice law in the State of [_______] and do not purport to be an expert on, or to express any opinion concerning, any laws other than the law of the State of [_______], the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the federal law of the United States.  Insofar as the opinions expressed in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above relate to matters which are governed by the laws of the State of New York, I have assumed for purposes of rendering such opinions that the applicable laws of the State of New York are substantially identical to the laws of the State of [_______].

Very truly yours,
 
 
To the Banks listed on Exhibit A
hereto and to Citibank, N.A.,
as Administrative Agent
 
 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as special New York counsel to Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), individually and as Administrative Agent, in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement (364-Day Facility) dated as of March 31, 2009 (Credit Agreement), among the Borrowers, the Banks party thereto, and Citibank, as Administrative Agent for the Banks.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined.
 
In that connection, we have examined the following documents:
 
(1)  Counterparts of the Credit Agreement, executed by each of the parties thereto.
 
(2)  The opinion of Joseph H. Currin, internal counsel for Caterpillar Inc. (Caterpillar), dated as of the date hereof.
 
(3)  The opinion of Bryon L. Koepke, internal counsel for Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (CFSC), dated as of the date hereof.
 
In our examination of the documents referred to above, we have assumed the authenticity of all such documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures, the due authority of the parties executing such documents, and the conformity to the originals of all such documents submitted to us as copies.  We have also assumed that each of the Banks and the Administrative Agent have duly executed and delivered the Credit Agreement with all necessary power and authority (corporate and otherwise).
 
To the extent that our opinion expressed below involves conclusions as to the matters set forth in the opinions of counsel referred to in items (2) and (3) above, we have assumed without independent investigation the correctness of the matters set forth therein.
 
Based upon the foregoing examination of documents and assumptions, and subject to the qualifications contained herein, and upon such other investigation as we have deemed necessary, we are of the opinion that the Credit Agreement is, and the Notes executed by each of Caterpillar and CFSC and delivered on or prior to the date hereof are, the legal, valid and binding obligations of each of Caterpillar and CFSC, respectively, enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.
 
Our opinion above is subject to the following qualifications:
 
     (a)  Our opinion above is subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.  In applying such principles, a court, among other things, might not allow a creditor to accelerate maturity of a debt upon the occurrence of a default deemed immaterial or might decline to order a debtor to perform covenants.  Such principles applied by a court include a requirement that a creditor act with reasonableness and in good faith.
 
     (b)  Our opinion above is also subject (i) to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar law affecting creditors rights generally and (ii) to the effect of any federal or state law, rule or regulation (including any federal or state securities law, rule or regulation) or public policy, to the extent that such law, rule, regulation or public policy limits rights to indemnification.
 
     (c)  Our opinion above is limited to the law of the State of New York, and we do not express any opinion herein concerning any other law.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we express no opinion as to (i) the effect of the law of any jurisdiction, other than the State of New York, wherein any Bank may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement or the Notes may be sought which limits the rates of interest legally chargeable or collectible, or (ii) whether any of the Banks is doing business in the State of New York.
 
     (d)  We express no opinion as to the effect of the compliance or noncompliance of the Administrative Agent or any of the Banks with any state or federal laws or regulations applicable to any such party because of such partys legal or regulatory status, the nature of such partys business or the authority of any party to conduct business in any jurisdiction.
 
     (e)  We express no opinion as to (i)  or of the Credit Agreement, insofar as they provide that any Bank purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant thereto may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such participation or that any Affiliate of a Bank may exercise set-off or similar rights with respect to such Banks claims under the Credit Agreement or the Notes; (ii) or of the Credit Agreement, to the extent that any such section may be construed as requiring indemnification with respect to a claim, damage, liability or expense incurred as a result of any violation of law by a Bank or the Administrative Agent; (iii) the first sentence of of the Credit Agreement, insofar as such sentence relates to the subject matter jurisdiction of the United States District Court to adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit Agreement; or (iv) or , the last sentence of of the Credit Agreement.
