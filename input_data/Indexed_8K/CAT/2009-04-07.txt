Joint Venture Operating Agreement
 
Upon the consummation of the transactions set forth in the Truck Business Relationship Agreement and in connection with the formation of the Joint Venture Company, Caterpillar, Navistar and the Joint Venture Company will enter into a Joint Venture Operating Agreement (the Operating Agreement) to conduct the Joint Venture Business.  The Operating Agreement will be the Joint Venture Companys primary operating document and contain the understanding and agreement of the parties regarding the governance and operation of the Joint Venture Business.

Caterpillar and Navistar will each provide the Joint Venture Company with certain products and services pursuant to the terms of one or more sales and services agreements.  Navistar may also require the Joint Venture to develop, design, test, manufacture, and assemble medium and heavy-duty, cab-over engine trucks, and replacement parts therefor, to sell to Navistar for resale in North America pursuant to one or more sales and services agreements.  In the event that Navistar sources heavy duty, cab over engine trucks from the Joint Venture for resale in North America, the market share of vocational heavy-duty, cab-over engine trucks is equal to or greater than 10% of the total market share of vocational heavy-duty trucks in North America or upon approval of the Joint Ventures Board of Directors, Caterpillar may require the Joint Venture Company to develop, design, test, manufacture, and assemble vocational heavy-duty, cab-over engine trucks, and replacement parts therefor, to sell to Caterpillar for resale in North America pursuant to one or more sales and services agreements.
 
Under the Operating Agreement, each of Caterpillar and Navistar will initially own 50% of the ownership interests in the Joint Venture Company.  Upon the execution of the Operating Agreement, each of Caterpillar and Navistar will contribute $45.5 to the Joint Venture as an initial capital contribution.  In addition, each of Caterpillar and Navistar are committed to provide the Joint Venture Company with up to an additional $123.4 million of required funding over the following three years.  Each year the Board of Directors of the Joint Venture Company must agree to an annual and a five-year rolling business plan, which include additional three year funding commitments.
 
Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, the Joint Venture Company will have a Board of Directors consisting of six directors, with Caterpillar and Navistar each appointing three of the directors.  A President, appointed by Navistar, will manage the Joint Venture Companys day-to-day operations.  The President and the Chief Financial Officer, which shall be appointed by Caterpillar, will each be appointed for a three year term.  The initial term of the Operating Agreement will be 25 years, subject to five-year extensions upon written agreement of Caterpillar and Navistar.  The Operating Agreement contains various termination provisions; however, the Joint Venture Business may not be terminated by either Caterpillar or Navistar without mutual consent unless a material breach, a deadlock with respect to an annual or a five-year rolling business plan (at least five years after execution of the Operating Agreement), a dilution of Caterpillars or Navistars ownership interest below 25%, or a change of control of Caterpillar or Navistar has occurred, whereupon a party may terminate the Operating Agreement or, in certain instances, buyout the other party pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement.
 
Under the Operating Agreement, the Joint Venture Company, Caterpillar, Navistar and their affiliates are subject to various exclusivity and non-competition provisions.  Subject to certain exceptions, Caterpillar, Navistar and their affiliates are prohibited from engaging in business, either directly or indirectly, within the scope of the Joint Venture Business.

EXHIBIT 99.2
As the next step in the alliance announced in June 2008, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) and Navistar International Corporation (NYSE: NAV) have signed a definitive agreement to produce Caterpillar heavy-duty vocational trucks for sale in North America and form a 50/50 joint venture that will pursue global commercial truck opportunities outside of North America.
 
 This joint venture leverages the complementary
 
strengths of two great companies to serve global markets, said Daniel C. Ustian, Chairman, President and CEO, Navistar.  The venture will be distinctively positioned to offer customers world class on-highway trucks through the unequaled sales and service network of Cat and International dealers around the world, and the deep product expertise of Navistar.
 
We are extremely pleased with the commitment that the teams have demonstrated to make the signing of this global venture possible, said Caterpillar Chairman and CEO, Jim Owens.  This is an important milestone and Caterpillar looks forward to becoming a significant player in the global on-highway truck market.  Additionally, the introduction of a Cat Vocational Truck line in North America represents an exciting opportunity for Caterpillar and the Caterpillar dealer network to extend our reach in this market and offer customers a total job site solution.
Global Commercial Truck Markets Outside of North America
The 50/50 joint venture will develop, manufacture and distribute commercial trucks in regions outside of North America and India.  Markets for the joint venture products will be assessed individually with initial focus being Australia, Brazil, China, Russia, South Africa and Turkey.   It is anticipated that the portfolio of products will feature both aero nose and cab-over designs and will be sold under both the Caterpillar and International brands.  The first products are expected to be available as early as the third quarter of 2009.
 
 We believe this clearly is an opportunity where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, said Dee Kapur, President Navistar Truck Group.  While Cat and Navistar do not compete in our core businesses, each brings distinctive capabilities to the table and have common goals to expand the base of engine, truck and equipment customers worldwide.
 
The transaction is subject to receipt of various regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, including the execution of the related joint venture operating agreement and other ancillary agreements.
 
Following the closing of the transaction, a leadership team and board of directors comprised of both Caterpillar and Navistar representatives will be named.
North America Caterpillar Vocational Trucks
Under the strategic alliance Caterpillar and Navistar will develop and manufacture a new line of heavy-duty Caterpillar vocational trucks for North America only. The new Caterpillar trucks will be co-developed by Caterpillar and Navistar and manufactured in Navistars Garland, Texas, facility.  The trucks will be sold and serviced through the Caterpillar North American Dealer network.
 
The heavy-duty vocational trucks will be purpose-built to complement Caterpillars existing product line and will give Caterpillar dealers an unmatched ability to support customer needs from extraction through delivery, said George Taylor, Director and General Manager of the Caterpillar Global On-Highway Department.
The Caterpillar trucks will feature key Caterpillar proprietary components and technology and will target customers who operate in a wide variety of vocational applications, such as earth moving, quarry, waste, mining, general and heavy construction, logging and road construction.
 
 Caterpillar is proud to be working with an innovative leader to provide our customers distinctly Caterpillar vocational trucks in North America, Taylor added.
The new Caterpillar on-highway vocational trucks will be unveiled in late 2010 and will go into full production in early 2011.  The trucks will be sold and serviced exclusively by Caterpillar Dealers in North America.  The transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including the execution of the related strategic alliance agreement and certain other ancillary agreements.
