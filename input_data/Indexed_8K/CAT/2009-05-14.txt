This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed to reflect certain retrospective adjustments that have been made to the consolidated financial statements of Caterpillar Inc. (the Company) that were previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Company on February 20, 2009 as Exhibit 13 to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.  The financial statements reflecting adjustments for the following items are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1:

 
 
EXHIBIT 23
We hereby consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statements on Form S-3 (Nos. 333-43133, 33-46194, 333-22041, 333-43983, 333-57512, 333-71468, 333-136265, 333-135123, 333-135465, 33-40393, 33-39120), Form S-8 (Nos. 2-97450, 333-37353, 33-8003, 333-03609, 333-41464, 333-98197, 333-115837, 333-32853, 333-32851, 333-111355, 333-128342, 333-135467, 333-133275, 333-133266, 333-133265, 333-141548) and Form S-4 (No. 333-121003) of Caterpillar Inc. of our report dated February 19, 2009, except as to Note 29 which is as of May 14, 2009, relating to the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, which appears in this Current Report on Form 8-K.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Caterpillar Inc.:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position and the related consolidated statements of results of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flow, including pages A-4 through A-59, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (not included herein).  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
As discussed in Notes 1K and 29 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for noncontrolling interests as of January 1, 2009, the manner in which it measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value in 2008, the manner in which it accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in 2007, and the manner in which it accounts for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, effective December 31, 2006.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As described in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (not included herein), management has excluded Caterpillar Japan Ltd. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 because Caterpillar Japan Ltd. was consolidated by the Company on August 1, 2008.  We have also excluded Caterpillar Japan Ltd. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.  Caterpillar Japan Ltd. is a 67 percent owned subsidiary of the Company with total assets and total revenues representing 5% and less than 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008.  Prior to consolidation, the Company accounted for its investment in this entity under the equity method.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations which follows has been retrospectively adjusted for the Company's adoption of SFAS 160 and changes to its operating and reportable segments.  See Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.
 
 
OVERVIEW
2008 sales and revenues were $51.324 billion, up 14 percent from 2007.  Profit per share was $5.66, up 5 percent and profit after tax of $3.557 billion was about flat with 2007.  Fourth-quarter sales and revenues were $12.923 billion, 6 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2007.  Profit per share for the quarter was $1.08, down 28 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007.
While 2008 was our sixth consecutive year of record sales and revenues, it was an extraordinarily challenging year. Through the first three quarters we experienced booming demand from key global industries, notably mining and energy, and most emerging market countries. Delivery times for many products were extended, and we were focused on increasing production and expediting shipments to meet customer needs. Then we were whipsawed in the fourth quarter as key industries were hit by a rapidly deteriorating global economy and plunging commodity prices.  In anticipation of lower demand we encouraged dealers to align inventory with declining volume, and they responded with significant order cancellations, particularly in December.
For the year, sales and revenues increased $6.366 billion $3.816 billion from higher , $1.352 billion from improved , $653 million from the effects of , $284 million from higher Financial Products revenues and $261 million from the consolidation of Caterpillar Japan Ltd. (Cat Japan).   Profit for 2008 was about flat with 2007, with the positive impact of higher price realization, improved sales volume and lower income tax expense about offset by higher operating costs, especially material and freight costs.

Fourth-quarter sales and revenues of $12.923 billion increased $779 million from the fourth quarter of last year.  Higher sales volume of $494 million, improved price realization of $308 million, $261 million related to the consolidation of Cat Japan and $19 million from higher Financial Products revenues were partially offset by $303 million of lower sales from the effects of currency.  Fourth-quarter profit of $661 million decreased $314 million as significantly higher and operating costs and a sharp decline in profit related to , more than offset a $409 million favorable tax item and favorable price realization.

Engines
Financial Products
Fourth-quarter profit was disappointing, particularly in light of record fourth-quarter sales and revenues and a significant favorable tax adjustment.  Fourth-quarter costs included transitional expenses as we moved to lower volumes and initiated production cuts.  In addition, Financial Products results were impaired by financial market turbulence.  It is now clear that we need to sharply lower our production and costs, and aggressive actions were triggered in December.
Global economic conditions and key commodity prices have continued to decline significantly.  Financial markets remain under stress, and our expectations for 2009 have deteriorated.  Uncertainty around the depth and duration of this recession makes it very difficult to forecast sales and revenues.  As a result, we are rapidly executing strategic trough plans and implementing actions throughout the company to deal with a very challenging global business environment.  We have initiated actions which will remove about 20,000 workers from our business and every indirect spend dollar will be heavily scrutinized.  These actions support lowering our production costs in line with a 25-percent decline in sales volume and reducing Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) and Research and Development (R&D) costs supporting our business by about 15 percent.  We are encouraged by government stimulus programs and actions taken by central banks around the world to spur growth.  However, economic conditions remain uncertain, and we are planning for 2009 sales and revenues to be in a range of plus or minus 10 percent from $40 billion.  At $40 billion in 2009 sales and revenues, the company expects to achieve profit of about $2.00 per share, or $2.50 per share excluding redundancy costs.
Machinery and Engines
These are very uncertain times, and its imperative that we focus Team Caterpillar on dramatically reducing production schedules and costs in light of poor economic conditions throughout the world.  While its painful for our employees and suppliers, its absolutely necessary given economic circumstances. We expect to have most of the actions needed to lower employment and cost levels in place by the end of the first quarter.
 
Page A-61
Without a doubt, 2009 will be a very tough year, but it is important to remember that economic cycles are not new, and we will emerge from this even stronger than we are today.  Throughout our 83-year history Caterpillar has successfully managed through the Great Depression, several recessions, a world war and numerous other adversities. Were a strong company with a management team thats been through tough times before.  We are the global leader, with an unparalleled dealer network.  Weve strengthened our market position in past recessions, and we have done so over the past few months.  In addition, we will continue to invest in product technology and operational efficiency through these tough times.  When the economy does recover, the need for better housing, roads and capacity for energy and mining will still be there, and we will be prepared to respond.

OPERATING PROFIT
 
2008 operating profit of $4.448 billion was down $473 million from 2007 as improved price realization and higher sales volume were more than offset by higher costs and the unfavorable impact of currency.
Manufacturing costs
increased $1.694 billion compared with 2007.  The majority of the manufacturing cost increase was driven by higher material and freight costs.  Material costs increased due to higher steel and commodity prices, and freight costs increased primarily due to higher fuel prices, and expediting costs related to higher production volume.  In addition, manufacturing labor and overhead costs increased to support capacity expansion and velocity initiatives.
SG&A and R&D costs were up $605 million to support significant new product programs and growth.
Currency had a $154 million unfavorable impact on operating profit as the benefit to sales was more than offset by the negative impact on costs.

2007 COMPARED WITH 2006
SALES AND REVENUES
 
 
 
Sales and revenues for 2007 were $44.958 billion, up $3.441 billion, or 8 percent, from 2006.  2007 machinery sales were up 9 percent as strong growth outside North America and a full year of Progress Rail more than offset a weak U.S. construction market. Machinery volume was up $1.289 billion.  Excluding Progress Rail, machinery volume was up $514 million.  Although sales volume increased moderately, the geographic shift in sales was significant.  North American machinery sales were down 11 percent; machinery sales outside of North America were up 33 percent.
Engines sales increased 6 percent despite the 59 percent decline in North American on-highway truck engines. Sales volume was down slightly as growth in engines sales to industries like oil and gas, electric power, industrial and marine nearly offset the volume decline in on-highway truck engines.
In addition, price realization was more than 2 percent despite an unfavorable geographic mix.  Currency had a positive impact on sales of $890 million driven primarily by the stronger euro.  Financial Products revenues were up 13 percent.
 
Page A-75
 
 
of $28.359 billion were an increase of $2.297 billion, or 9 percent, from 2006. Excluding Progress Rail, machinery volume increased $514 million.  Sales volume decreased in North America but increased in all other regions. Price realization increased $410 million. Currency benefited sales by $598 million. Geographic mix between regions (included in price realization) was $182 million unfavorable. The acquisition of Progress Rail added $775 million. North American dealers reduced reported inventories substantially in 2007, taking them well below a year earlier in months of supply.  Inventories in months of supply declined in most other regions as well.  Economic factors, primarily in the United States, contributed to lower sales volume in North America.  These factors included the collapse in housing construction, weakness in nonresidential construction contracts in the last half of 2007 and a decline in quarry and aggregate production.  Sales volume increased in the rest of the world, offsetting weakness in North America.  Positives included relatively low interest rates, good economic growth and continued growth in construction.  Metals mining was positive in many countries throughout the world.  Metals prices increased, and mining companies increased exploration spending by more than 40 percent.  Oil prices increased about 10 percent, and natural gas prices increased 4 percent.  Production and drilling increased in many regions, and pipeline construction increased.  Transportation problems, particularly in Australia, contributed to a significant increase in international coal prices.  The impact on sales volume variednegative for Australia and the United States but positive elsewhere.

OPERATING PROFIT
 
 
Operating profit in 2007 of $4.921 billion was equal to 2006 as higher price realization and sales volume were offset by higher
core operating costs
.
Core operating costs rose $1.232 billion from 2006. Of this increase, $1.225 billion was attributable to higher
manufacturing costs
.  The increase in manufacturing costs was primarily due to operating inefficiencies and higher material costs. Operating inefficiencies were the result of supply chain challenges, capacity increases, factory repair and maintenance and a significant decline in on-highway truck engine production.  Also, we incurred additional costs for new product introductions and costs to enhance customer-delivered quality.  Wage and benefit increases as well as increased warranty and depreciation also contributed to higher manufacturing costs.  In 2007, Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) and R&D expenses were essentially flat with 2006.  The impact of higher wage and benefit costs was offset by the absence of approximately $70 million of 2006 expense related to a settlement of various legal disputes with Navistar.
Currency had a $73 million unfavorable impact on operating profit as the benefit to sales was more than offset by the negative impact on costs.
Machinery
operating profit of $2.758 billion was down $269 million, or 9 percent, from 2006.  Higher core operating costs were partially offset by improved price realization, higher sales volume and the addition of Progress Rail.  The geographic mix of sales had an unfavorable impact on price realization.
 
Page A-78
 
Engines
operating profit of $1.826 billion was up $196 million, or 12 percent, from 2006.  The favorable impacts of improved price realization and positive mix of product were partially offset by higher core operating costs and the unfavorable impacts of currency.  Growth in demand for electric power, petroleum, marine and industrial applications more than offset the profit decline related to the drop in demand for on-highway truck engines.
operating profit of $690 million was up $20 million, or 3 percent, from 2006.  The increase was primarily attributable to a $42 million impact from improved net yield on average earning assets and a $34 million impact from higher average earning assets, partially offset by a $29 million increase in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial and a $24 million decrease in operating profit at Cat Insurance due to higher claims experience.
Financial Products
 
OTHER PROFIT/LOSS ITEMS
 
was income of $357 million compared with income of $243 million in 2006.  The change was primarily driven by a $46 million gain on the sale of a cost-basis investment, the favorable impacts of currency and other items that were individually insignificant.
Other income/expense
for 2007 reflects an annual tax rate of 29.8 percent compared to a 28.8 percent rate in 2006.  The increase over 2006 is primarily due to the repeal of Extraterritorial Income Exclusion benefits in 2007 partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective.
The provision for income taxes
Employee Separation Charges
During 2008, we recognized employee separation charges of $30 million in Other operating expenses related to various voluntary and involuntary separation programs.  These programs, impacting approximately 3,000 production and support and management employees world-wide, are in response to a sharp decline in sales volume due to the current global recession.  Our accounting for separations is dependent upon how the particular program is designed.  For voluntary programs, eligible separation costs are recognized at the time of employee acceptance.  For involuntary programs, eligible costs are recognized when management has approved the program, the affected employees have been properly identified and the costs are estimable.
The separation charges, which will be made up primarily of cash severance payments, were not assigned to operating segments and are included in the reconciliation of total accountable profit from reportable segments to total profit before taxes.  The following table summarizes the separation charges by geographic region:
As of December 31, 2008, approximately 1,600 employees had separated, with the remaining separations expected by the end of first quarter 2009.  The majority of the remaining costs will be paid by the end of the first quarter 2009.
Subsequent Events
Employee Separation Programs
In response to the expected sharp decline in 2009 sales volume, Caterpillar implemented the following employee separation programs during 2009:
During December 2008, we announced a voluntary separation program for certain support and management employees based in the United States.  Eligible employees had until January 12, 2009 to sign-up for the plan, and generally until January 31, 2009 to make a final decision.  Participating employees will receive severance pay based on current salary level and years of service.  As of January 31, 2009, approximately 2,200 employees had accepted the program and are generally expected to separate from Caterpillar by March 31, 2009.  We are currently estimating the costs associated with this program.
U.S. Voluntary Separation Program
-
 
Page A-79
 
 
During 2009, we initiated plans to reduce U.S. based production and support and management positions through a variety of programs.  For support and management employees, these include involuntary separation programs.  For production employees, these include both involuntary and voluntary separation programs.  We are currently estimating the costs associated with these programs.
Other U.S. Separation Programs
- -
We have initiated several other separation programs during 2009.  These programs, designed specific to the laws and regulations of the individual countries, represent voluntary and involuntary plans for production and support and management employees.  We are currently estimating the costs associated with these programs.
Non-U.S. Separation Programs -
 
We will continue to monitor the economic environment and, depending on business conditions, more voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions may be required as 2009 unfolds.
Cat Financial Debt Issuance
On February 12, 2009, Cat Financial issued $350 million of 5.75% notes due in 2012, $1.65 billion of 6.125% notes due in 2014 and $1.0 billion of 7.15% notes due in 2019.  The net proceeds from the issuance will be used to reduce short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.
Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd. (SCM)
On August 1, 2008, SCM completed the first phase of a share redemption plan whereby SCM redeemed half of MHIs shares in SCM for $464 million.  This resulted in Caterpillar owning 67 percent of the outstanding shares of SCM and MHI owning the remaining 33 percent.  As part of the share redemption, SCM was renamed Caterpillar Japan Ltd. (Cat Japan).  Both Cat Japan and MHI have options, exercisable after five years, to require the redemption of the remaining shares owned by MHI, which if exercised, would make Caterpillar the sole owner of Cat Japan.  The share redemption plan is part of our comprehensive business strategy for expansion in the emerging markets of Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States and will allow Cat Japans manufacturing, design and process expertise to be fully leveraged across the global Caterpillar enterprise.
The change in Caterpillars ownership interest from 50 percent to 67 percent was accounted for as a business combination.  The $464 million redemption price was assigned to 17 percent of Cat Japans assets and liabilities based upon their respective fair values as of the transaction date.  The revaluation resulted in an increase in property, plant and equipment of $78 million and an increase in inventory of $8 million over the book value of these assets.  Finite-lived intangible assets of $54 million were recognized and related primarily to customer relationships, intellectual property and trade names. These intangibles are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average amortization period of approximately 9 years.  Deferred tax liabilities of $57 million were also recognized as part of the business combination. Goodwill of $206 million, non-deductible for income tax purposes, represents the excess of the redemption price over the 17 percent of Cat Japans net tangible and finite-lived intangible assets that were reported at their fair values.
Because Cat Japan is accounted for on a lag, we consolidated Cat Japans August 1, 2008 financial position on September 30, 2008.  We began consolidating Cat Japans results of operations in the fourth quarter of 2008. Including the amounts assigned as part of the business combination, the initial consolidation of Cat Japans financial position resulted in a net increase in assets of $2,396 million (primarily property, plant and equipment of $1,279 million, inventory of $640 million, receivables of $612 million, and goodwill and intangibles of $260 million partially offset by a $528 million reduction in investment in unconsolidated affiliates) and a net increase in liabilities of $2,045 million (including $1,388 million in debt).  Cat Japans functional currency is the Japanese Yen.
Additionally, the remaining 33 percent of Cat Japan owned by MHI has been reported as redeemable noncontrolling interest and classified as mezzanine equity (temporary equity) in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. On September 30, 2008, the redeemable noncontrolling interest was reported at its estimated future redemption value of $464 million with the difference between the $351 million book value of the 33 percent interest and the redemption value reported as a $113 million reduction of Profit employed in the business.
In subsequent reporting periods, the redeemable noncontrolling interest will continue to be reported at its estimated redemption value.  Any adjustment to the redemption value will impact Profit employed in the business, but will not impact Profit.  If the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest falls below the redemption value, profit available to common stockholders would be reduced by the difference between the redemption value and the fair value.  This would result in lower profit in the profit per common share computation in that period.  Reductions impacting the profit per common share computation may be partially or fully reversed in subsequent periods if the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest increases relative to the redemption value.  Such increases in profit per common share would be limited to cumulative prior reductions.  As of December 31, 2008, there has been no change to the estimated future redemption value, and the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest has remained greater than the redemption value.

With the consolidation of Cat Japans results of operations, 33 percent of Cat Japans comprehensive income or loss is attributed to the redeemable noncontrolling interest, impacting its carrying value.  Because the redeemable noncontrolling interest must be reported at its estimated future redemption value, the impact from attributing the comprehensive income or loss is offset by adjusting the carrying value to the redemption value.  This adjustment impacts Profit employed in the business, but not Profit.  In 2008, we adjusted the carrying value by $2 million resulting in a corresponding reduction to Profit employed in the business.  As Cat Japans functional currency is the Japanese Yen, changes in exchange rates affect the reported amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest.  At December 31, 2008, the redeemable noncontrolling interest was $524 million.
Cat Japan was included in the Cat Japan segment in Note 24.  Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results.
Progress Rail Services, Inc.
In June 2006, Caterpillar acquired 100 percent of the equity in privately held Progress Rail Services, Inc. (Progress Rail) for approximately $1 billion, including the assumption of $200 million in debt. Based in Albertville, Alabama, Progress Rail is a leading provider of remanufactured locomotive, railcar and track products and services to the North American railroad industry. The company also has one of the most extensive rail service and supply networks in North America. When acquired, Progress Rail operated more than 90 facilities in 29 states in the United States, Canada and Mexico, with about 3,700 employees. Expansion into the railroad aftermarket business is a strong fit with our strategic direction and will leverage Caterpillar's remanufacturing capabilities.
The transaction was financed with available cash and commercial paper borrowings of $427 million and Caterpillar stock of $379 million (5.3 million shares). Net tangible assets acquired, recorded at their fair values, primarily were inventories of $257 million, receivables of $169 million and property, plant and equipment of $260 million. Liabilities acquired, recorded at their fair values, primarily consisted of assumed debt of $200 million, accounts payable of $148 million and net deferred tax liabilities of $115 million. Finite-lived intangible assets acquired of $223 million related primarily to customer relationships are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years. Goodwill of $431 million, non-deductible for income tax purposes, represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and finite-lived intangible assets acquired. The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and reported in the All Other category in Note 24. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Sources of funds
We generate significant capital resources from operating activities, which are the primary source of funding for our Machinery and Engines operations.  Funding for these businesses is also provided by commercial paper and long-term debt issuances.  Financial Products operations are funded primarily from their existing retail portfolio and commercial paper and term debt issuances.  Despite recent credit market conditions, we have continued to have access to liquidity in both our Machinery and Engines and Financial Products operations.  Given global recessionary conditions and sharply declining sales volume we are executing our strategic trough plans.  Most of our trough actions will result in lower cash needs in 2009.
Consolidated operating cash flow for 2008 was $4.80 billion, compared with $7.96 billion in 2007.  The decrease of $3.16 billion is primarily the result of the absence of a 2007 benefit from reduced terms for North American receivables, a $497 million increase in taxes paid, and a $453 million increase in contributions to pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  In addition, working capital requirements, particularly inventory, increased in 2008, negatively impacting operating cash flow.  See further discussion of operating cash flow under Machinery and Engines and Financial Products.   Although we expect profit to decline in 2009, we expect operating cash flow to benefit from a significant decline in inventory and receivables.
Total debt as of December 31, 2008 was $35.54 billion, an increase of $7.11 billion from year-end 2007.  Debt related to Machinery and Engines increased $3.82 billion due to the consolidation of Cat Japan and also to provide for a higher cash position in the event that short-term credit markets become disrupted.  Debt related to Financial Products increased $3.29 billion due to growth in Cat Financial's portfolio and also to provide for an appropriate cash position given uncertain market conditions.
We have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $6.85 billion (Credit Facility) available in the aggregate to both Machinery and Engines and Financial Products to support commercial paper programs in the event the programs become unavailable to us.  During 2008, based on managements allocation decision, which can be revised at any time, the portion of the Credit Facility allocated to Cat Financial was increased from $5.55 billion to $5.85 billion.  The five-year facility of $1.62 billion expires in September 2012.  The five-year facility of $2.98 billion expires in September 2011.  The 364-day facility was increased from $1.95 billion to $2.25 billion and will expire in September 2009.  As part of the 2008 Credit Facility renewal, Cat Financials year-end and six-month moving average leverage covenants have been increased from 8.5:1 to 10:1.  In 2008, Cat Financial entered into a new 364-day facility of $300 million with a syndicate of banks, which expires in July 2009.  The overall increase in the credit facilities was to support Cat Financials portfolio growth.
At December 31, 2008, Caterpillars annual consolidated net worth dropped below the level stipulated in the Credit Facility.  This covenant requires Caterpillar to maintain a consolidated net worth of not less than 75% of the consolidated net worth as of the end of its immediately preceding fiscal year.  The decrease was largely driven by a significant decline in pension asset returns, resulting in a $3.4 billion year-end charge to other comprehensive income.
In addition, at December 31, 2008, Cat Financials quarterly interest coverage ratio for the fourth quarter dropped below the level stipulated in the Credit Facility.  This covenant requires Cat Financial to maintain a ratio of (1) earnings before interest expense and income taxes to (2) interest expense of not less than 1.15 to 1 for each fiscal quarter.  The ratio was negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of 2008 by, among other things, deteriorating economic conditions.  This, in addition to Caterpillars drop in consolidated net worth, also resulted in Cat Financial falling below or failing to meet similar covenant requirements in other loan agreements.
The associated bank group under the Credit Facility has consented to Caterpillars lower annual consolidated net worth of $6.087 billion as of December 31, 2008, and to Cat Financials lower quarterly interest coverage ratio of 0.97 as of December 31, 2008.  The bank group also agreed that any failure to comply with consolidated net worth and interest coverage ratio requirements would not constitute an actual or potential event of default under the Credit Facility.  In consideration of these agreements, the upper range of interest rate applicable to certain amounts that may be drawn by us under the Credit Facility was increased by approximately 1.00 to 1.50 percentage points.
The lenders under Cat Financials other loan agreements also have agreed that Caterpillar and Cat Financial will not be required to comply with the covenant ratios for the fourth quarter 2008.  In consideration of those agreements, the upper range of interest rate applicable to certain amounts that may be drawn by us under those loan agreements were increased by approximately 1.00 percentage point.
As noted above, the actions by the bank group and other lenders only apply to the fourth quarter of 2008. In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the bank group may terminate the commitments allocated to the non-compliant party or the commitments could be, depending on the circumstances, reallocated among Caterpillar and/or Cat Financial.  Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financials other lenders under other loan agreements where such financial covenants are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under such loan agreements, including accelerating outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2008, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility.
 
Page A-83
 
Our total credit commitments as of December 31, 2008 were:
 
Consolidated credit lines with banks as of December 31, 2008 total $4.48 billion. These credit lines, which are eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements.  Caterpillar Inc. or Cat Financial generally guarantees subsidiary borrowings under these lines.
 
The generally deteriorating economic conditions, our 2009 outlook and the condition of credit markets increase the risk that one or more of the credit rating agencies may decrease their credit rating for Caterpillar, Cat Financial or their debt securities.  In the event that Caterpillar or Cat Financial, or any of their debt securities, experiences a credit rating downgrade it would likely result in an increase in our borrowing costs and make access to certain credit markets more difficult.
 
If global conditions deteriorate so significantly that access to debt market becomes unavailable, our Machinery and Engines operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances ($1.52 billion at year-end 2008), borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our revolving credit facility.  Our Financial Products operations would rely on cash flow from its existing retail portfolio of approximately $1 billion per month, utilization of existing cash balances ($1.22 billion at year-end 2008), access to our revolving credit facility and other credit line facilities held by Cat Financial and potential borrowings from Caterpillar.
 
 
Machinery and Engines
Operating cash flow was $3.57 billion in 2008 compared to $5.47 billion in 2007.  Operating cash flow decreased primarily due to an increase in taxes paid and higher contributions to pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  In addition, working capital requirements, particularly inventory, increased in 2008, negatively impacting Machinery and Engines operating cash flow.  Net cash used for investing activities in 2008 was $2.56 billion compared to $1.68 billion in 2007.  The increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures.  Net cash used for financing activities in 2008 was $529 million compared with $3.26 billion in 2007.  The change is primarily the result of a $1.5 billion long-term debt issuance in December 2008 and a reduction in common stock repurchases.  The long-term debt offering generated strong investor demand.  Proceeds were used to reduce short-term borrowings and to provide a cash position appropriate for market conditions.  We also have strong demand for our commercial paper and we have benefited from very low commercial paper interest rates.
Our priorities for the use of cash remain unchanged -- a strong financial position that helps protect our credit rating, capital to support growth, appropriately funded employee benefit plans, modestly increasing dividends and common stock repurchases with excess cash.

Financial Products
Financial Products 2008 operating cash flow of $1.10 billion was about the same as 2007.  Net cash used for investing activities in 2008 was $3.75 billion compared to $1.24 billion in 2007.  This increased use of cash was primarily due to the growth in finance receivables and the absence of higher collections in 2007 related to reduced terms for trade receivables purchased by Cat Financial.  Net cash provided by financing activities in 2008 was $3.62 billion compared with $190 million in 2007, primarily due to increased funding requirements related to the increased portfolio growth, as well as to provide cash position appropriate for market conditions.
The allowance for credit losses was 1.44 percent of finance receivables, net of unearned income, at December 31, 2008, compared to 1.39 percent at December 31, 2007.  Receivables written off due to uncollectibility, net of recoveries on receivables previously written off, were $121 million and $68 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively.  The increase in write-offs is attributable to economic conditions primarily in North America.  
From a historical perspective, total write-offs, net of recoveries, for the last U.S. recessionary period in 2002 were 0.69 percent of our average retail portfolio compared to the year-to-date rate of 0.48 percent.  Consistent with our economic outlook and expected further weakening of the global economy, we expect past dues and write-offs will likely be higher in 2009 compared with 2008.
At the end of 2008, Cat Financial's allowance for credit losses totaled $395 million, an increase of $42 million from the end of 2007. Of the increase, $28 million is attributable to growth in the retail finance receivable portfolio, while $14 million resulted from increasing the allowance rate from 1.39 percent to 1.44 percent of net finance receivables
Despite recent credit market conditions, Cat Financial continued to have access to liquidity, although at increased credit spreads on new term debt issuance.  Cat Financial was able to issue commercial paper throughout the year.  U.S. commercial paper issuance experienced consistent demand and attractive pricing although maturity conditions fluctuated as the year drew to a close.  Throughout the year, demand and liquidity varied in non-U.S. markets and certain non-U.S. credit markets were periodically closed to Cat Financial and similarly situated issuers as a result of the volatile credit market conditions in 2008, particularly in the second half of the year.  Cat Financials access to these non-U.S. markets has improved as credit market conditions have improved.  As the global liquidity situation evolves, Cat Financial will continue to monitor and adapt their funding approach accordingly.  As mentioned above,
certain rating agencies have increased their focus on the extent to which Caterpillar and Cat Financial have cash and cash equivalents and unused credit lines available to meet short-term debt requirements.  Caterpillar and Cat Financial have been taking this focus into account when planning for 2009 liquidity needs.  This focus may result in higher cash balances and corresponding increases in the net cost of funds.
 
Financial Products total borrowings were $27.71 billion at December 31, 2008, an increase of $3.29 billion from December 31, 2007.  Debt repayment in Financial Products depends primarily on timely repayment and collectibility of the receivables portfolio.  At December 31, 2008, finance receivables past due over 30 days were 3.88 percent, compared with 2.36 percent at December 31, 2007.  This increase began with the downturn in the U.S.
economy and has spread to other geographic locations.

To maintain an alternative funding source, Cat Financial periodically (generally once a year) sells certain finance receivables relating to retail installment sale contracts and finance leases.  In each of these transactions, the applicable finance receivables are sold to a special purpose entity (SPE).  The SPEs have limited purposes and generally are only permitted to purchase the finance receivables, issue asset-backed securities and make payments on the securities.  The SPEs only issue a single series of securities and generally are dissolved when those securities have been paid in full.  The SPEs, typically trusts, are considered to be qualifying special-purpose entities (QSPEs) and thus, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 140 (SFAS 140), are not consolidated.  The QSPEs issue debt to pay for the finance receivables they acquire from Cat Financial.  The primary source for repayment of the debt is the cash flows generated from the finance receivables owned by the QSPEs.  The assets of the QSPEs are legally isolated and are not available to pay the creditors of Cat Financial or any other affiliate of Cat Financial.  The QSPEs held total assets of $909 million related to these securitizations as of December 31, 2008.  We use QSPEs in a manner consistent with conventional practices in the securitization industry to isolate these finance receivables, which are secured by new and used equipment, for the benefit of securitization investors.
"Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities,"
 
The use of the QSPEs enables us to access the U.S. securitization market for the sale of these types of financial assets.  The amounts of funding from securitizations reflect such factors as capital market accessibility, relative costs of funding sources and assets available for securitization.  Cat Financial had cash proceeds from initial sales of these receivables of $600 million and $650 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $12 million and $4 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively.  The fair value of the retained interests in all securitizations of retail finance receivables outstanding, totaling $52 million and $49 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, are included in Other assets.  Our
sensitivity analysis indicated that the impact of a 20 percent adverse change in individual assumptions used to calculate the fair value of all our retained interests as of December 31, 2008, would be $8 million or less.
Contractual obligations
 
Page A-86
 
We adopted FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes as of January 1, 2007.  The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including positions impacting only the timing of tax benefits, was $803 million at December 31, 2008.  Payment of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. Due to the difficulty in determining the timing of settlements, FIN 48 obligations are not included in the table above.  We do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair market values for goodwill impairment tests, warranty liability, stock-based compensation, reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. We have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each.
 The residual values for Cat Financials leased assets, which are based upon the estimated wholesale market value of leased equipment at the time of the expiration of the lease, represent a careful analysis of historical wholesale market sales prices, projected forward on a level trend line without consideration for inflation or possible future pricing action.  At the inception of the lease, residual values are derived from consideration of the following critical factors: market size and demand, any known significant market/product trends, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities and past re-marketing experience, third party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.  During the term of the leases, residual amounts are monitored.  If estimated market values reflect a non-temporary impairment due to economic factors, obsolescence or other adverse circumstances, the residuals are adjusted to the lower estimated values by a charge to earnings.  For equipment on operating leases, the charge is recognized through depreciation expense.  For finance leases, it is recognized through a reduction of finance revenue.
Residual values for leased assets
 
 We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it likely that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit.  We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.
Fair values for goodwill impairment tests
Determining whether an impairment has occurred requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we estimate using a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value based upon a comparative market Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) multiple.  The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting units long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval of our senior management. The market EBITDA multiple is based on market transactions in the reporting units industry. The discount rate is based on our weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participants perspective. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in interest rates, growth rates, costs, pricing, capital expenditures and market conditions.
The 2008 annual impairment test indicated the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value, including goodwill. In the fourth quarter of 2008, economic and market conditions deteriorated, affecting the outlook of our various businesses.  Although our businesses have been impacted by the economic downturn, Caterpillars market capitalization has remained significantly above its book value and an evaluation of our reporting units indicated that it was unlikely the fair value of any reporting unit fell below its carrying value.  Accordingly, we did not perform an interim goodwill impairment test subsequent to the annual impairment test.
A prolonged economic downturn resulting in lower EBITDA multiples, lower long-term growth rates and reduced long-term profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Industry specific events or circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units.  Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting units fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment test.  Future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment, depending on the outcome of both step one and step two of the impairment review process.  A goodwill impairment would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings.
Available-for-sale securities, primarily at Cat Insurance, are reviewed at least quarterly to identify fair values below cost which may indicate that a security is impaired and should be written down to fair value.
Impairment of available-for-sale securities 
 
Page A-87
 
For debt securities, once a securitys fair value is below cost we utilize data gathered by investment managers, external sources and internal research to monitor the performance of the security to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred.  These reviews consist of both quantitative and qualitative analysis and require a degree of management judgment.  Securities in a loss position are monitored and assessed at least quarterly based on severity of loss and may be deemed other-than-temporarily impaired at any time.  Once a securitys fair value has been twenty percent or more below its original cost for six consecutive months, the security will be other-than-temporarily impaired unless there are sufficient facts and circumstances supporting otherwise.
For equity securities in a loss position, determining whether the security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires an analysis of the securities historical sector returns and volatility. This information is utilized to estimate the securitys future fair value to assess whether the security has the ability to recover to its original cost over a reasonable period of time as follows:
 
 
In the event the estimated future fair value is less than the original cost, qualitative factors are then considered in determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which includes reviews of the following:  significant changes in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of the investee, significant changes in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee operates, and length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost.  These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.
 At the time a sale is recognized, we record estimated future warranty costs.  The warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory.  Generally, historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size.  Specific rates are developed for each product build month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.  Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.
Warranty liability
 We use a lattice-based option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock option and SARs.  The calculation of the fair value of the awards using the lattice-based option-pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following:
Stock-based compensation
 
The fair value of our RSUs is determined by reducing the stock price on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period. The estimated dividends are based on Caterpillars weighted-average dividend yields. A decrease in the dividend yield would result in an increase in our expense.
Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the number of awards that are expected to vest.  In determining the stock-based compensation expense to be recognized, a forfeiture rate is applied to the fair value of the award.  This rate represents the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited prior to vesting and is based on Caterpillar employee historical behavior.  Changes in the future behavior of employees could impact this rate.  A decrease in this rate would result in an increase in our expense.
 
Page A-88
 We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels.
Product liability and insurance loss reserve
 
 Primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows:
Postretirement benefits
 
 
 
 We provide discounts to dealers and OEMs through merchandising programs that are administered by our marketing groups.  We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products.  The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user.  OEM programs provide discounts designed to encourage the use of our engines. The cost of discounts is estimated based on historical experience and planned changes in merchandising programs and is reported as a reduction to sales when the product sale is recognized.  The amount of accrued post-sale discounts was $828 million, $669 million and $726 million as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  The reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly.  The reserve is adjusted if discounts paid differ from those estimated.  Historically, those adjustments have not been material.
Post-sale discount reserve
 Management's ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses considers both impaired and unimpaired finance receivables and takes into consideration past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions. In estimating probable losses we review accounts that are past due, non-performing, in bankruptcy or otherwise identified as at risk for potential credit loss. Accounts are identified as at risk for potential credit loss using information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings as well as general information regarding industry trends and the general economic environment.
Credit loss reserve
 
The allowance for credit losses attributable to specific accounts is based on the most probable source of repayment, which is normally the liquidation of collateral. In determining collateral value we estimate current fair market value of collateral and factor in credit enhancements such as additional collateral and third party guarantees. The allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts is a general allowance based upon the risk in the portfolio, primarily using probabilities of default and an estimate of associated losses. In addition, qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in previous analysis including industry trends, macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.
 
While management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions which have resulted in an allowance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, there can be no assurance that in the future, changes in economic conditions or other factors might cause changes in the financial health of our customers which could change the timing and level of payments received thus necessitating a change to our estimated losses.
 
Page A-89
 
 Despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged by taxing authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. Our tax reserves reflect the difference between the tax benefit claimed on tax returns and the amount recognized in financial statements in accordance with FIN 48.  FIN 48 requires that tax benefits recognized in the financial statements must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits.  The amount of benefit recorded for these positions is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not to be sustained.  Significant judgment is required in making these determinations.  As the examination process progresses with tax authorities, adjustments to tax reserves may be necessary to reflect taxes payable upon settlement.  Tax reserve adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes.  Tax reserve adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.

EMPLOYMENT
 
Caterpillars worldwide employment was 112,887 at the end of 2008, up 11,554 from a year ago.  Of the increase, approximately 5,500 were the result of consolidating Cat Japan and about 1,300 were the result of acquisitions.  The remaining increase of 4,800 employees primarily supported growth and new product introductions.
OTHER MATTERS
ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL MATTERS
 
The company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or global competitive position.
We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws.  When it is reasonably probable we will pay remedial costs at a site and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the costs are charged against our earnings.  In formulating that estimate, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others.  The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
We cannot reasonably estimate costs at sites in the very early stages of remediation.  Currently, we have a few sites in the very early stages of remediation and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all sites in the aggregate, will be required.
On May 14, 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Notice of Violation to Caterpillar Inc., alleging various violations of Clean Air Act Sections 203, 206 and 207.  EPA claims that Caterpillar violated such sections by shipping engines and catalytic converter after-treatment devices separately, introducing into commerce a number of uncertified and/or misbuilt engines and failing to timely report emissions-related defects.  Caterpillar is currently engaging in negotiations with EPA to resolve these issues, but we are unable at this time to place precise estimates on the potential exposure to penalties.  However, Caterpillar is cooperating with EPA and, based upon initial discussions and although penalties could potentially exceed $100,000, management does not believe that this issue will have a material adverse impact on our financial position.

We have disclosed certain individual legal proceedings in this filing.  Additionally, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues or intellectual property rights.  Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
 
On September 29, 2004, Kruse Technology Partnership (Kruse) filed a lawsuit against Caterpillar in the United States District Court for the Central District of California alleging that certain Caterpillar engines built from October 2002 to the present infringe upon certain claims of three of Kruse's patents on engine fuel injection timing and combustion strategies.  Caterpillar denied Kruse's allegations and filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration from the court that Caterpillar is not infringing upon Kruse's patents and that the patents are invalid and unenforceable.  On December 20, 2008, Caterpillar and Kruse entered into a confidential settlement agreement whereby all pending claims with regard to the lawsuit were settled.  The settlement, which did not have a material impact on our financial statements, included an agreement by both parties to not bring any future actions in the matter.  Subsequent to the agreement, the court entered an order dismissing the case.
 
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
 
On January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment," (SFAS 123R) using the modified prospective transition method.  The modified prospective transition method requires compensation expense to be recognized in the financial statements for all awards granted after the date of adoption as well as for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding as of the date of adoption.  Prior to the date of adoption of SFAS 123R, we used the intrinsic-value based method, as described in Accounting Principles Board No. 25, to account for stock options and no compensation expense was recognized in association with our stock awards.
In anticipation of the adoption of SFAS 123R, we did not modify the terms of any previously granted options. Our stock incentive plans provide for the granting of nonqualified options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs) and restricted stock units (RSUs) to officers, directors and key employees of the company.  In 2007, in order to align our stock award program with the overall market, we adjusted our 2007 grant by reducing the overall number of employee awards and utilizing RSUs in addition to the SARs and option awards.  The 2008, 2007 and 2006 awards generally vest three years after the date of grant.  At grant, SARs and option awards have a term life of ten years.  Upon separation from service, if the participant is 55 years of age or older with more than ten years of service, the participant meets the criteria for a Long Service Separation".  If the Long Service Separation criteria are met, the vested options/SARs will have a life that is the lesser of 10 years from the original grant date or five years from the separation date.
We use a lattice-based option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options and SARs granted.  We use the stock price on the day of grant reduced by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period to estimate the fair value of the RSUs granted.  The adoption of SFAS 123R reduced operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2006 by $137 million and reduced profit after-tax by $92 million ($.14 per share basic and $.09 per share diluted).  2008 and 2007 stock-based compensation expense was $194 million and $146 million, respectively.  At December 31, 2008, $136 million of expense with respect to unvested stock-based awards has yet to be recognized and will be expensed over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (SFAS 158), "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)." SFAS 158 requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet.  Under SFAS 158, gains and losses, prior service costs and credits and any remaining transition amounts under SFAS 87 and SFAS 106 that have not yet been recognized through net periodic benefit cost are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic cost.  Also, the measurement date  the date at which the benefit obligation and plan assets are measured  is required to be the company's fiscal year-end. We adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions at December 31, 2006, and adopted the year-end measurement date effective January 1, 2008 using the one measurement approach.  Under the one measurement approach, net periodic benefit cost for the period between any early measurement date and the end of the fiscal year that the measurement provisions are applied is allocated proportionately between amounts to be recognized as an adjustment of Profit employed in the business and net periodic benefit cost for the fiscal year.  Previously, we used a November 30 measurement date for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans and September 30 for our non-U.S. plans.  The adoption of the balance sheet recognition provisions reduced December 31, 2006 assets by approximately $500 million, increased liabilities by approximately $2.20 billion and reduced stockholders' equity by approximately $2.70 billion. Also, we reclassified approximately $500 million from current liabilities to long-term liabilities based on the classification guidelines provided in SFAS 158.  The adoption of the year-end measurement date provisions increased January 1, 2008 assets by $8 million, increased liabilities by $24 million and reduced stockholders equity by $16 million.  The adoption of this Statement did not impact our results of operations.

We recognized pension expense of $200 million in 2008 as compared to $361 million in 2007. The decrease in expense was primarily a result of lower amortization of net actuarial losses due to higher discount rates and better than expected asset returns.  In addition, pension expense for 2007 included a $44 million charge to recognize previously unrecorded liabilities related to a subsidiary pension plan.  SFAS 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," as amended by SFAS 158, requires companies to discount future benefit obligations back to today's dollars using a discount rate that is based on high-quality fixed-income investments. A decrease in the discount rate increases the pension benefit obligation, while an increase in the discount rate decreases the pension benefit obligation.  This increase or decrease in the pension benefit obligation is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently amortized into earnings as an actuarial gain or loss.  SFAS 87 also requires companies to use an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for computing current year pension expense. Differences between the actual and expected asset returns are also recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently amortized into earnings as actuarial gains and losses. At the end of 2008, total actuarial losses recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were $7.74 billion, as compared to $2.72 billion in 2007. The majority of the actuarial losses are due to significant asset losses during 2008 in addition to losses from other demographic and economic assumptions over the past several years.  The $5.02 billion increase from 2007 to 2008 was primarily the result of asset losses during 2008, partially offset by an increase in discount rate and foreign exchange rate gains for non-U.S. plans.
 
In 2008, we recognized other postretirement benefit expense of $287 million compared to $311 million in 2007. The decrease in expense was primarily the result of lower amortization of actuarial losses due to higher discount rates. Actuarial losses recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for other postretirement benefit plans were $881 million at the end of 2008. These losses mainly reflect significant asset losses during 2008, an increase in expected health care inflation and several years of declining discount rates. The losses were $122 million higher at the end of 2008 as compared to 2007 due to asset losses during 2008, partially offset by lower than expected health care costs.
 
Actuarial losses for both pensions and other postretirement benefits will be impacted in future periods by actual asset returns, actual health care inflation, discount rate changes, actual demographic experience and other factors that impact these expenses. These losses, reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), will be amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the benefit plans. At the end of 2008, the average remaining service period of active employees was 10 years for our U.S. pension plans, 13 years for our non-U.S. pension plans and 7 years for other postretirement benefit plans. We expect our amortization of net actuarial losses to increase approximately $87 million in 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily due to asset losses during 2008.  We expect our total pension and other postretirement benefits expense to increase approximately $250 million in 2009, excluding any impact from redundancy charges.
For our U.S. pension plans, our 2008 asset allocation was 70 percent equity securities and 30 percent debt securities, and our target allocation for 2009 is 70 percent equity securities, 25 percent debt securities and 5 percent real estate. The 2008 asset allocation for our non-U.S. pension plans was 50 percent equity securities, 41 percent debt securities, 6 percent real estate and 3 percent other. The 2009 target allocation for our non-U.S. pension plans is 54 percent equity securities, 37 percent debt securities, 6 percent real estate and 3 percent other. Our target asset allocations reflect our investment strategy of maximizing the rate of return on plan assets and the resulting funded status, within an appropriate level of risk. The U.S. plans are rebalanced to plus or minus five percentage points of the target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis. The frequency of rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan.
The use of certain derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives. The U.S. plans currently utilize futures contracts to offset current equity positions in order to rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation. During 2008, approximately 5 percent of the U.S. pension plans assets were rebalanced from equity to fixed income positions through the use of futures contracts, as compared to 10 percent for 2007 and 2006. The actual asset allocation percentages above represent this rebalancing effort. The plans do not engage in futures contracts for speculative purposes.
 
During 2008, we made cash contributions of $288 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $134 million to our non-U.S. pension plans.  We expect to make approximately $1 billion of contributions during 2009, most of which are required. We have adequate liquidity resources to fund both U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans.
 
Actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on both pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. The effects of a one percentage point change in our primary actuarial assumptions on 2008 benefit costs and year-end obligations are included in the table below.

SENSITIVITY
 
Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity
Machinery and Engines use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to five years. Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our Machinery and Engines operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2009 cash flow for our Machinery and Engines operations by approximately $378 million. Last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $100 million adverse impact on 2008 cash flow.  We determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. We multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity.
 
Since our policy for Financial Products operations is to hedge the foreign exchange risk when the currency of our debt portfolio does not match the currency of our receivable portfolio, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year.
 
The effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including competitive risk. If it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above. In addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar. In reality, some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen. Our primary exposure (excluding competitive risk) is to exchange rate movements in the British pound, Japanese yen and euro.
 
Interest Rate Sensitivity
For our Machinery and Engines operations, we have the option to use interest rate swaps to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move (increase) in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect 2009 pretax earnings of Machinery and Engines by $16 million. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $9 million adverse impact on 2008 pretax earnings. This effect is caused by the interest rate fluctuations on our short-term debt and interest rate swaps.
fixed-to-floating
 
For our Financial Products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives and strategies. We have a match-funding policy whereby the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of our debt portfolio is matched to the interest rate profile of our earning asset portfolio (finance receivables and operating leases) within certain parameters. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate swap agreements to modify the debt structure. Match funding assists us in maintaining our interest rate spreads, regardless of the direction interest rates move.
 
In order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates, Financial Products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pretax earnings. All on-balance sheet positions, including derivative financial instruments, are included in the analysis. The primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities, the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant. Based on the December 31, 2008 balance sheet under these assumptions, the analysis estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained parallel rise in interest rates to be a $28 million decrease to pretax earnings for 2009.  Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $19 million adverse impact on 2008 pretax earnings.
 
This analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement, nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Profit Per Share Excluding Redundancy Costs
Caterpillar has historically provided a profit per share outlook for the following year in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  In 2009, we expect to incur significant redundancy costs related to employment reductions as a result of company actions to reduce costs in response to an expected significant decline in sales volume and so we provided an outlook for profit per share of $2.50 excluding redundancy costs, a non-GAAP measure.  We believe it is important to separately quantify the expected amount of redundancy charges in order for our outlook to be meaningful to our readers.
Reconciliation of profit per share excluding redundancy costs to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, profit per share:
 
 
Supplemental Consolidating Data
 
We are providing supplemental consolidating data for the purpose of additional analysis.  The data has been grouped as follows:
 
Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Consolidated
 
The Machinery and Engines data contained in the schedules on pages A-96 to A-98 are "non-GAAP financial measures" as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Regulation G. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and therefore, are unlikely to be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Caterpillar defines Machinery and Engines as it is presented in the supplemental data as Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries with Financial Products accounted for on the equity basis. Machinery and Engines information relates to our design, manufacturing, marketing and parts distribution operations. Financial Products information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other equipment. The nature of these businesses is different, especially with regard to the financial position and cash flow items. Caterpillar management utilizes this presentation internally to highlight these differences. We also believe this presentation will assist readers in understanding our business.
