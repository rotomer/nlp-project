As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590) signed into law on March 23, 2010 (the Act), beginning in 2011 the tax deduction available to Caterpillar Inc. (Caterpillar) will be reduced to the extent its drug expenses are reimbursed under the Medicare Part D retiree drug subsidy (RDS) program.  Although this tax increase does not take effect until 2011, Caterpillar is required to recognize the full accounting impact in its financial statements in the period in which the Act is signed.  As retiree healthcare liabilities and related tax impacts are already reflected in Caterpillars financial statements, the change will result in a charge to Caterpillars earnings in the first quarter of 2010 of approximately $100 million after tax.  This charge reflects the anticipated increase in taxes that will occur as a result of the Act.  As mentioned on page A-106 of Caterpillars Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, Caterpillars 2010 Profit Outlook is based on tax law in effect as of February 19, 2010 and does not include the impact of the Act.
