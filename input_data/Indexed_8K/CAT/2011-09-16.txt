Creation of Revolving Credit Facilities
 
On September 15, 2011, Caterpillar Inc. ("Caterpillar") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "364-Day Facility") among Caterpillar, Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation ("Cat Financial"), Caterpillar International Finance Limited ("CIF") and Caterpillar Finance Corporation ("CFC" and, together with Caterpillar, Cat Financial and CIF, the "Borrowers"), certain financial institutions named therein ("364-Day Banks"), Citibank, N.A. ("Agent"), Citibank International plc ("Local Currency Agent"), and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. ("Japan Local Currency Agent"), which provides for an unsecured aggregate revolving credit facility to the Borrowers of up to US$2.550 billion ("364-Day Aggregate Commitment") and expires on September 13, 2012.  A Local Currency Addendum that enables CIF to borrow in certain approved currencies including Pounds Sterling, Swiss Francs and Euro for an aggregate amount up to the equivalent of US$100 million and a Japan Local Currency Addendum that enables CFC to borrow Japanese Yen for an aggregate amount up to the equivalent of US$100 million, as part of the 364-Day Aggregate Commitment, were also executed on September 15, 2011.
 
On September 15, 2011, the Borrowers entered into a Credit Agreement (the "5-Year Facility") among the Borrowers, certain financial institutions named therein ("5-Year Banks" and, together with the 364-Day Banks, the "Banks"), the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, and the Japan Local Currency Agent, which provides for an unsecured aggregate revolving credit facility to the Borrowers of up to US$3.861 billion ("5-Year Aggregate Commitment") and expires on September 15, 2016.  A Local Currency Addendum that enables CIF to borrow in certain approved currencies including Pounds Sterling, Swiss Francs and Euro for an aggregate amount up to the equivalent of US$1 billion and a Japan Local Currency Addendum that enables CFC to borrow Japanese Yen for an aggregate amount up to the equivalent of US$75 million, as part of the 5-Year Aggregate Commitment, were also executed on September 15, 2011.
 
The 364-Day Facility and the 5-Year Facility (collectively, the "Credit Facilities") are available to support the commercial paper programs of the Borrowers in the event those programs become unavailable and for general corporate purposes. The Borrowers have not drawn on the Credit Facilities.
 
The Credit Facilities contain certain representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including financial covenants.  Under the Credit Facilities, Caterpillar is required to maintain consolidated net worth not less than US$9 billion at all times.  Caterpillar's consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated stockholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Cat Financial is required to maintain an interest coverage ratio above 1.15 to 1, where the interest coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended.  Cat Financial is also required to maintain a leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth) below 10.0 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) on each December 31.  Drawings under the Credit Facilities are also subject to conditions precedent and the payment of certain facility fees.
 
Certain of the Banks and the Agent, as well as certain of their respective affiliates, have performed, and may in the future perform, for Caterpillar and its subsidiaries, various commercial banking, investment banking, underwriting and other financial advisory services, for which they have received and may in the future receive customary fees and expenses.
 
The foregoing description of the Credit Facilities is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and provisions of the Credit Facilities and the Local Currency Addenda to each of the Credit Facilities, filed as exhibits to this report, and incorporated herein by reference.

(e)       Although the Approved Electronic Platform and its primary web portal are secured with generally-applicable security procedures and policies implemented or modified by the Agent from time to time (including, as of the Closing Date, a dual firewall and a User ID/Password Authorization System) and the Approved Electronic Platform is secured through a single-user-per-deal authorization method whereby each user may access the Approved Electronic Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each of the Banks and each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not
necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution.

If any such costs or expenses are attributable to a particular Borrower, such costs or expenses shall be paid by such Borrower.  In all other cases, such costs or expenses shall be paid by Caterpillar.
 
(b)           If any payment of principal of any Eurocurrency Rate Advance or a TIBO Rate Advance is made other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, as a result of a payment pursuant to or acceleration of the maturity of the Advances pursuant to or for any other reason, or if the Banks receive payments from an Added Bank in connection with the purchase of a participation in Eurocurrency Rate Advances by such Added Bank pursuant to , the applicable Borrower shall, upon demand by any Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank any amounts as such Bank shall reasonably determine in good faith to be required to compensate such Bank for any additional losses, costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment.  Such indemnification shall include, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Bank to fund or maintain such Advance; , , that any indemnification for such losses, costs and expenses shall be limited to an amount equal to (i) the principal amount of the Advance paid by such Borrower or the amount of the participation purchased by such Added Bank, as the case may be, (ii) the number of days remaining in the Interest Period applicable to such Advance, divided by 360, (iii) the interest differential between the interest rate applicable to such Advance and the rate of interest which would apply on an Advance to such Borrower of the same Type requested on the date of such payment by such Borrower for an Interest Period which most nearly approximates the remaining term of the Interest Period applicable to the Advance paid by such Borrower.  A certificate describing in reasonable detail the amount of such losses, costs and expenses, and specifying therein the Type of loan in reference to which such Bank shall have made its calculations thereof (the ""), submitted to such Borrower and the Agent by such Bank, shall create a rebuttable presumption of the rate applicable to the Reference Investment identified therein.  In making any determination under this , each Bank shall use reasonable efforts to minimize the amount payable by such Borrower hereunder to such Bank, that such action does not result in any additional cost, loss or expense for such Bank and is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.

On the first day of each Interest Period (or as soon as possible thereafter) the Local Currency Agent shall calculate, as a percentage rate, a rate (the "Associated Cost Rate") for the Alternate Currency Banks, in accordance with the paragraphs set out below.  The Associated Cost Rate so determined by the Local Currency Agent shall be the weighted average of the Additional Cost Rates of each of the Local Currency Banks, weighted in proportion that the Local Currency Commitment of each such Local Currency Bank bears to the Total Local Currency Commitment.  The Associated Cost Rate will be expressed as a percentage rate per annum.
 
The Associated Cost Rate for a Local Currency Bank lending from a lending installation in a member state of the European Communities that adopts or has adopted the Euro as its lawful currency in accordance with legislation of the European Union relating to European Monetary Union, will be the cost (stated as a percentage) of complying with the minimum reserve requirements of the European Central Bank.
 
The Associated Cost Rate for a Local Currency Bank lending from a lending installation in the United Kingdom will be calculated by the Local Currency Agent as follows:
 
(a)
                                 
in relation to a Local Currency Advance in Pounds Sterling:
 
(b)
                                
in relation to a Local Currency Advance in any currency other than Pounds Sterling:
 
 
Where:
 
A
                                     
is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (assuming these to be in excess of any stated minimum) which the Local Currency Bank is from time to time required to maintain as an interest free cash ratio deposit with the Bank of England to comply with cash ratio requirements.
 
B
                                       
is the percentage rate of interest (excluding the Applicable Margin and the Associated Cost Rate) payable for the relevant Interest Period on the Advance.
 
C
                                       
is the percentage (if any) of Eligible Liabilities which the Local Currency Bank is required from time to time to maintain as interest bearing Special Deposits with the Bank of England.
 
D
                                      
is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to the Local Currency Bank on interest bearing Special Deposits.
 
E
                                        
is the rate of charge payable by the Local Currency Bank to the Financial Services Authority pursuant to the Fees Regulations (but, for this purpose, ignoring any minimum fee required pursuant to the Fees Regulations) and expressed in Pounds Sterling per 1,000,000 of the Fee Base of the Local Currency Bank.
 
For the purposes of this Schedule:
 
(a)
         
"" and "" have the meanings given to them from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of England Act 1998 or (as may be appropriate) by the Bank of England;

(c)

Fee Base
 
In application of the above formulae, A, B, C and D will be included in the formulae as percentages (i.e., 5 percent will be included in the formula as 5 and not as 0.05).  A negative result obtained by subtracting D from B shall be taken as zero.  The resulting figures shall be rounded to four decimal places.
 
In particular, but without limitation, each Local Currency Bank shall supply to the Agent and the Local Currency Agent the following information in writing on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Local Currency Bank:
 
(a)
         
its jurisdiction of incorporation and the jurisdiction of its lending installation; and
 
(b)
        
any other information that the Agent and the Local Currency Agent may reasonably require for such purpose.
 
The percentages or rates of charge of a Local Currency Bank for the purpose of A, C and E above shall be determined by such Local Currency Bank based upon the information supplied by it pursuant to paragraph 7 above and on the assumption that, unless the Local
Currency Bank notifies the Local Currency Agent to the contrary, the Local Currency Bank's obligations in relation to cash ratio deposits, Special Deposits and the Fees Regulations are the same as those of a typical bank from its jurisdiction of incorporation with a lending installation in the same jurisdiction as its lending installation.
 
The Local Currency Agent shall have no liability to any person if such determination results in an Associated Cost Rate which over or under compensates a Local Currency Bank and shall be entitled to assume that the information provided by a Local Currency Bank pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 7 above is true and correct in all respects.
 
Any determination by the Local Currency Agent pursuant to this Schedule in relation to a formula, the Associated Cost Rate or any amount payable to the Local Currency Banks shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all of the parties to this Addendum.
 
Any Local Currency Bank may from time to time, after consultation with CFSC, CIF, the Local Currency Agent and the Agent, determine and notify to all parties any amendments which are required to be made to this Annex in order to comply with any change in law, regulation or any requirements from time to time imposed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank (or, in any case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) and any such determination shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all the parties to this Addendum.
