Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On June 21, 2012, Caterpillar Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), with respect to the offering and sale of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 0.950% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "2015 Notes"), $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 1.500% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes"), and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 2.600% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes" and, together with the 2015 Notes and the 2017 Notes, the "Notes") under the Company's effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-162837).  The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company, and customary closing conditions, indemnification rights and termination provisions.
 
The sale of the Notes is expected to close on June 26, 2012, subject to customary closing conditions.  The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the sale of the Notes for general corporate purposes.
 
The Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of May 1, 1987 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as successor trustee.  The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and (i) with respect to the 2015 Notes, will bear interest at the rate of 0.950% per year and will mature on June 26, 2015, (ii) with respect to the 2017 Notes, will bear interest at the rate of 1.500% per year and will mature on June 26, 2017, and (iii) with respect to the 2022 Notes, will bear interest at the rate of 2.600% per year and will mature on June 26, 2022.  Interest on the Notes will be payable on June 26 and December 26 of each year, commencing on December 26, 2012, to the persons in whose names such Notes are registered as of the close of business on the preceding June 11 or December 11, as the case may be (whether or not a business day).  The amount of interest payable on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
 
The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2015 Notes and the 2017 Notes at any time and from time to time, and some or all of the 2022 Notes at any time and from time to time prior to March 26, 2022 (three months prior to the maturity date of the 2022 Notes), in each case at the greater of 100% of the principal amount of such Notes being redeemed or the discounted present value of such Notes, discounted at the corresponding U.S. Treasury rate plus 10.0 basis points in the case of the 2015 Notes, 12.5 basis points in the case of the 2017 Notes, and 15.0 basis points in the case of the 2022 Notes, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption. At any time on or after March 26, 2012, the Company may redeem some or all of the 2022 Notes at any time and from time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of redemption.  The Notes will be unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank equally with all of the Company's other unsecured senior indebtedness.
 
The Indenture includes certain restrictive covenants, including covenants that limit the ability of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur secured debt, enter into sale and lease-back transactions and consolidate, merge or transfer substantially all of the Company's assets to another entity. The covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Indenture.
 
The Indenture provides for customary events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), which include nonpayment, breach of covenants in the Indenture and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Notes to be due and payable.
 
The foregoing description of the Underwriting Agreement and the Notes are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of the Underwriting Agreement and the forms of the 2015 Notes, the 2017 Notes, and the 2022 Notes, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 1.1, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, Desmond A. Eppel, internal counsel
to the Company, provided the Company with the legality opinion attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 5.1.
 
The Underwriting Agreement has been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms and conditions. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Underwriting Agreement were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of specific dates, and were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Underwriting Agreement. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date of the Underwriting Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in public disclosures by the Company.

Section 7
.      Contribution. 
If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover of the Final Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover.
 
The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
 
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7.  The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this Section shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
 
No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall
 
have the same rights to contribution as the Company.  The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule A hereto and not joint.
 
Section 8
.  Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive Delivery. 
All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of the Securities to the Underwriters.
 
Section 9
.  Termination of Agreement. 
(a) .  The Representatives may terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or prior to Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the time of execution of this Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Disclosure Package, any material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries considered as one enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the financial markets in the United States or the international financial markets, any outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions, in each case the effect of which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representatives, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Company has been suspended or materially limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or (iv) if trading generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market has been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of said exchanges or by such system or by order of the Commission or any other Governmental authority, or (v) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either Federal or New York authorities.

Securities

Trustee
 
In this regard, I have examined the following documents:
 
a.
                                      
an executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement;
 
b.
                                     
the Registration Statement and the documents incorporated by reference therein;
 
c.
                                      
the Disclosure Package and the documents incorporated by reference therein;
d.
                                     
the Final Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein;
 
e.
                                      
the Securities in global form as executed by the Company;
 
f.
                                        
an executed copy of the Indenture; and
 
g.
                                     
the documents delivered to you by the Company at the closing pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, including copies of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the corporate secretary of the Company, respectively.
 
In addition, I have examined the originals, or copies certified to my satisfaction, of such other corporate records of the Company, certificates of public officials, and agreements, instruments and such other documents, and have conducted such other investigations of fact and law, as I have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth below, it is my opinion that:
 
i.
                                         
The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus;
 
ii.
                                      
The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus;
 
iii.
                                   
The Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of the State of Illinois;
 
iv.
                                  
I do not know of any litigation or any governmental proceeding instituted or threatened against the Company or any of its consolidated subsidiaries that, in my opinion, is reasonably likely to result in a judgment or decree having a Material Adverse Effect or otherwise be required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement which is not disclosed and accurately summarized, in all material respects, in the Disclosure Package;
 
v.
                                     
The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;
 
vi.
                                  
The Securities have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company and, when duly executed and delivered by the Company, duly authenticated by the Trustee and delivered against the payment of the purchase price therefor as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will
 
constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture, subject to limitations imposed by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;
 
vii.
                               
The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Trustee, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to limitations imposed by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the 1939 Act;
 
viii.
                            
The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture and the Underwriting Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated, will not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any agreement or instrument known to me to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound, and which conflicts, breaches and defaults, if any, would individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect; nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company or any statute of the United States of America, the State of New York or the State of Delaware that are applicable to transactions of the type contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture (provided that I express no opinion as to compliance with the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, the 1939 Act, the Delaware Securities Act, the Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended, with respect to any proceeding in which the Company is the debtor, or with any state securities or Blue Sky laws) or, to my knowledge, any order of any court or governmental agency or body of the United States of America or the State of Delaware; and no consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or the Indenture, except such as have been obtained under the 1933 Act and the 1939 Act (but I express no opinion relating to any state securities or Blue Sky laws);
 
ix.
                                    
The documents incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which I express no opinion or belief), when they were filed with the Commission, complied as to form in all material
 
respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder;
 
x.             The Registration Statement, as of the date on which any part thereof became effective, and the Final Prospectus, as of the date hereof (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein and Exhibit 25 to the Registration Statement, as to which I express no opinion or belief) complied or complies as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1939 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; and
 
xi.            The statements made in the Base Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Plan of Distribution" taken together with the statements made in the Final Prospectus under the captions "Description of the Notes," "Underwriting" and "Material United States Federal Income Tax Consequences" are accurate summaries, in all material respects, of the matters therein set forth insofar as they relate to the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture, the Underwriting Agreement and the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Securities and fairly present the information called for with respect thereto by the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
 
In addition, while I make no representation that I have independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in the documents incorporated by reference in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, no facts have come to my attention that have caused me to believe that any of such documents (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which I express no opinion or belief), when they were so filed, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made when such documents were so filed, not misleading, in each case after excluding any statement in any such documents which does not constitute part of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, or the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 412 of Regulation C under the 1933 Act; and further, while I make no representation that I have independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (other than as provided under the captions identified in paragraph (x) hereof), (i) no facts have come to my attention that have caused me to believe that any part of the Registration Statement, insofar as relevant to the offering of the Securities, as of the date on which such part became effective, or the Disclosure Package, as of the Execution Time, or the Final Prospectus, as of its date or as of the date hereof (other than the financial statements and related schedules and other financial data therein, management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included
 
therein and Exhibit 25 to the Registration Statement, as to which I express no opinion or belief), contained or contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case after excluding any statement in any such document which does not constitute part of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus pursuant to Rule 412 of Regulation C under the 1933 Act; and (ii) I do not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required to be incorporated by reference into the Final Prospectus or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus which are not filed or incorporated by reference or described as required.
 
With your permission, I have assumed the following:
 
1.
                                     
the authenticity of original documents and the genuineness of all signatures;
 
2.
                                     
the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies;
 
3.
                                     
the truth, accuracy and completeness of the information, factual matters, representations and warranties contained in the records, documents, instruments and certificates I have reviewed; and
 
4.
                                     
that, except as specifically covered in the opinions set forth above, the documents referred to herein were duly authorized, executed and delivered on behalf of the respective parties thereto and that such documents are legal, valid and binding obligations of such parties.
 
Whenever a statement herein is qualified by the phrases "I do not know," "I have no reason to believe," "known to me" or "to my knowledge," it is intended to indicate that, during the course of my representation of the Company, no information that would give me current actual knowledge of the inaccuracy of such statement has come to my attention as I have rendered legal services in connection with the representation described in the introductory paragraph of this opinion.  However, I have not undertaken any independent investigation to determine the accuracy of such statement, and any limited inquiry or review undertaken by me during the preparation of this opinion should not be regarded as such an independent investigation; no inference as to my knowledge of any matters bearing on the accuracy of any such statement should be drawn from the fact of my representation of the Company.
 
My opinion that any document is valid, binding or enforceable is qualified as to:
 
1.
                                     
limitations imposed by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally;
2.
                                     
the possibility that certain covenants and provisions for the acceleration of the maturity of the Securities may not be enforceable if enforcement would be unreasonable under the then existing circumstances; and
 
3.
                                     
general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
 
The foregoing opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
 
This opinion letter is limited to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion is implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly set forth herein.  The opinions expressed herein are being furnished to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such in connection with the offering of the Securities.  This opinion letter is not to be relied on by or furnished to any other person or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose without my prior written approval.  I assume no obligation to advise you or any other person, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinions expressed herein.

UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY TO THE ISSUER OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO., OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREON, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
 
 
 
CATERPILLAR INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporations under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., as nominee for The Depository Trust Company, or registered assigns, the principal sum of                                  ($                 ) on June 26, 2015, subject to advancement as provided in Annex A hereto, and to pay interest thereon from June 26, 2012, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on June 26 and December 26 of each year, commencing December 26, 2012, at the rate of 0.950% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) at the rate per annum borne by this Security on any overdue principal and on any overdue installment of interest.
If an Interest Payment Date or maturity date is not a Business Day, interest or principal will be paid on the next Business Day. However, interest on the payments will not accrue for the period from the original payment date to the date the payment is made. Interest will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
The interest so payable, and punctually paid or

Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
 
Payment of the principal of and interest on this Security due at Maturity in United States dollars will be made in immediately available funds to the depository or its nominee, that this Security is presented to the Trustee in time for the Trustee to make such payment in accordance with its normal procedures. Payment of interest (other than interest payable at Maturity) on this Security in United States dollars will be made by transfer of immediately available funds to the depository or its nominee.
provided

If the additional securities are not fungible with the previously outstanding Securities for United States federal income tax purposes, such additional securities will have a separate CUSIP number.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

This Security is a Global Security and shall be exchangeable for Securities registered in the names of Persons other than the depository with respect to this Global Security or its nominee only if (x) such depository notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for this Global Security or at any time ceases to be a clearing agency registered as such under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (a) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that this Global Security shall be exchangeable or (b) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to the Securities. If this Global Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for Securities issuable in a minimum denomination of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, registered in such names as such depository shall direct.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons and when not represented by one or more Global Securities, (a) will be issuable in a minimum denomination of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and (b) as provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, will be exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
This Security shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.
 
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

THIS SECURITY IS EXCHANGEABLE FOR SECURITIES REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A PERSON OTHER THAN THE DEPOSITORY OR ITS NOMINEE ONLY IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES HEREINAFTER DESCRIBED AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT AS A WHOLE BY THE DEPOSITORY TO A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY OR BY A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY TO ANOTHER NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITORY.
 
UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY TO THE ISSUER OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO., OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREON, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
 
 
 
CATERPILLAR INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporations under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., as nominee for The Depository Trust Company, or registered assigns, the principal sum of                                     ($               ) on June 26, 2022, subject to advancement as provided in Annex A hereto, and to pay interest thereon from June 26, 2012, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on June 26 and December 26 of each year, commencing December 26, 2012, at the rate of 2.600% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) at the rate per annum borne by this Security on any overdue principal and on any overdue installment of interest.
If an Interest Payment Date or maturity date is not a Business Day, interest or principal will be paid on the next Business Day. However, interest on the payments will not accrue for the period from the original payment date to the date the payment is made. Interest will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
The interest so payable, and punctually paid or
 
 
duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on June 11 or December 11, as the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date (whether or not a Business Day). Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
 
Payment of the principal of and interest on this Security due at Maturity in United States dollars will be made in immediately available funds to the depository or its nominee, that this Security is presented to the Trustee in time for the Trustee to make such payment in accordance with its normal procedures. Payment of interest (other than interest payable at Maturity) on this Security in United States dollars will be made by transfer of immediately available funds to the depository or its nominee.

This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof, limited initially in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000.
 
The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the Holders of the Securities, create and issue further securities having the same terms as the Securities in all respects (except for the issue date, issue price, payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of the Securities and, in some cases, the initial interest payment date of the Securities), so that such additional securities may be consolidated and form a single series with the Securities and have the same terms as to status, redemption or otherwise as the Securities. If the additional securities are not fungible with the previously outstanding Securities for United States federal income tax purposes, such additional securities will have a separate CUSIP number.
 
The Securities shall have the redemption features summarized in Annex A to this Global Security.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.

This Security is a Global Security and shall be exchangeable for Securities registered in the names of Persons other than the depository with respect to this Global Security or its nominee only if (x) such depository notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for this Global Security or at any time ceases to be a clearing agency registered as such under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (a) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that this Global Security shall be exchangeable or (b) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to the Securities. If this Global Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for Securities issuable in a minimum denomination of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, registered in such names as such depository shall direct.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons and when not represented by one or more Global Securities, (a) will be issuable in a minimum denomination of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and (b) as provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, will be exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
This Security shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.
 
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed under its corporate seal.

Caterpillar Inc.
Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-162837)
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
I am internal counsel for Caterpillar Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-162837) (such registration statement, as amended to the date hereof, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, relating to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), of the Company's debt securities and certain other classes of securities, which Registration Statement became effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Act.  Pursuant to the Registration Statement, the Company is issuing $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 0.950% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "2015 Notes"), $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.500% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes") and $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 2.600% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes" and, together with the 2015 Notes and the 2017 Notes, the "Notes"), which are being issued under an Indenture, dated as of May 1, 1987, as amended and supplemented (the "Indenture"), by and between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as successor trustee (the "Trustee").  The Notes are to be offered and sold pursuant to a Prospectus Supplement dated June 21, 2012 (the "Prospectus Supplement") and the Prospectus dated November 3, 2009 (the "Base Prospectus") that forms a part of the Company's Registration Statement.  This letter is being delivered in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Act.
 
I have examined (i) the Registration Statement, (ii) the Base Prospectus, (iii) the Prospectus Supplement, (iv) the Indenture, (v) the Notes in global form, (vi) the executed Underwriting Agreement, dated June 21, 2012, among the Company and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representatives of the several underwriters named in Schedule A thereto, relating to the issuance and sale of the Notes, (vii) certain resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted on June 10, 2009 and February 8, 2012 and certain resolutions of a special committee of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted on June 18, 2012, as certified by the Secretary of the Company on the date hereof as being true, complete and correct and in full force and effect, relating to, among other things, the authorization of the Registration Statement and the issuance and sale of the Notes and (viii) the restated certificate of incorporation of the Company, as amended, and the amended and restated by-laws of the Company, in each case, as currently in effect, and as certified by the Secretary of the Company on the date hereof as being true, complete and correct and in full force and effect.  I have also examined such other instruments, documents, and records which I deemed relevant and necessary for the basis of my opinion hereinafter expressed.  In such examination, I have assumed the authenticity of original documents, the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to me as copies, the legal capacity of all natural persons and the genuineness of all signatures.  I have also assumed that the Indenture is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Trustee.
 
Based on such examination, and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth herein, I am of the opinion that the issuance and sale of the Notes has been duly authorized by all necessary action by the Board of Directors of the Company and the authorized officers of the Company and, when such Notes have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and duly authenticated by the Trustee, all in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, and sold in the manner contemplated by the Registration Statement, any amendment thereto, the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Notes, and duly delivered to the purchasers thereof against payment of the agreed consideration therefor, the Notes will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
 
The foregoing opinion is limited to matters arising under the laws of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.  I hereby consent to the filing of this letter as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated June 25, 2012 and the incorporation by reference of this letter as an exhibit to the above-referenced Registration Statement and to the use of my name wherever it appears in the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto.  In giving such consent, I do not thereby admit that I am within the category of persons whose consent is required by Section 7 of the Act or the related rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued thereunder with respect to any part of the Registration Statement, including this letter as an exhibit or otherwise.
