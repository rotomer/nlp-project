The forms of the New Debentures are filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

THE COMPANY WILL PROVIDE A COPY OF THE REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT TO A HOLDER WITHOUT CHARGE UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO ITS PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS.
 
THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"). THE HOLDER HEREOF, BY ACQUIRING THIS SECURITY, AGREES THAT PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION COMPLIANCE PERIOD (AS DEFINED IN THE OFFICER'S CERTIFICATE ESTABLISHING THE TERMS OF THIS SECURITY), UNLESS THIS SECURITY IS REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, THIS SECURITY MAY ONLY BE OFFERED, RESOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED (A) INSIDE THE UNITED STATES TO A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OR (B) OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 903 OR 904 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND, IN EACH CASE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE STATES OF THE UNITED STATES OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.
 
THIS SECURITY IS A GLOBAL SECURITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A DEPOSITORY OR A NOMINEE OF A DEPOSITORY.

UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY TO THE ISSUER OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO., OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREON, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.
 
 
 
 
CATERPILLAR INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (herein called the "Company," which term includes any successor corporations under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., as nominee for The Depository Trust Company, or registered assigns, the principal sum of              DOLLARS ($             ) on August 15, 2042, subject to advancement as provided in Annex A hereto, and to pay interest thereon from August 15, 2012, or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing February 15, 2013, at the rate of 3.803% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment and (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable) at the rate per annum borne by this Security on any overdue principal and on any overdue installment of interest.
If an Interest Payment Date or maturity date is not a Business Day, interest or principal will be paid on the next Business Day. However, interest on the payments will not accrue for the period from the original payment date to the date the payment is made. Interest will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on February 1 or August 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date (whether or not a Business Day). Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.
 
Payment of the principal of and interest on this Security due at Maturity in United States dollars will be made in immediately available funds to the depository or its nominee, that this Security is presented to the Trustee in time for the Trustee to make such payment in accordance with its normal procedures. Payment of interest (other than interest payable at Maturity) on this Security in United States dollars will be made by transfer of immediately available funds to the depository or its nominee.
provided
 
By its acceptance of this Security (or any beneficial interest in this Security), each Holder thereof and each owner of a beneficial interest therein acknowledges the restrictions on transfer
 
of this Security (and any such beneficial interest) set forth herein (including in the legend set forth on the face hereof) and in the Indenture and agrees that it shall transfer this Security (and any such beneficial interest) only in accordance with the Indenture, this Security and such legend.
If (i) the Company determines (upon the advice of counsel and after consideration of other certifications and evidence as the Company may reasonably require) that a Security of this series is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or a successor provision) without being subject to any conditions as provided in Rule 144 and that the legend set forth on the face hereof is no longer necessary or appropriate in order to ensure that subsequent transfers of the Security (or a beneficial interest therein) are effected in compliance with the Securities Act, (ii) a Security of this series is sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or (iii) a Security of this series is validly tendered and exchanged for a Security of this series pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, then, in each such case, the Company may instruct the Trustee to cancel such Security and issue to the Holder thereof (or to its transferee) a new Security of like tenor and amount of this series, registered in the name of the Holder thereof (or its transferee), that does not bear the legend set forth on the face hereof, and the Trustee shall comply with such instruction.
 
An owner of a beneficial interest in this Security may provide to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall accept) a written request, accompanied by a certification that such owner is either a non-U.S. person (within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act) or a U.S. Person that purchased the Securities of such series in a transaction that did not require registration under the Securities Act, at any time after the relevant 40-day "distribution compliance period" as such term is defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act (the "Distribution Compliance Period"), which commences on the date this Security is issued (it being understood that the Trustee shall not accept any such request and certification during the Distribution Compliance Period).  Promptly after acceptance of any such request and certification with respect to such a beneficial interest, the Trustee shall cause such beneficial interest to be exchanged for an equivalent beneficial interest in a Global Security of the same series that does not bear the Regulation S Restricted Legend (a "Permanent Regulation S Global Security"), and shall (i) permanently reduce the principal amount of this Security by the amount of such beneficial interest and (ii) increase the principal amount of such Permanent Regulation S Global Security by the amount of such beneficial interest.
 
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, if after the Distribution Compliance Period any dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration in respect of the Securities of this series owns a beneficial interest in this Security, such person may, upon written request to the Trustee accompanied by a certification as to its status as dealer or a person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration in respect of the Securities, exchange such beneficial interest for an equivalent beneficial interest in a Permanent Regulation S Global Security, and the Trustee will comply with such request and shall (i) permanently reduce the principal amount of this Security by the amount of such beneficial interest and (ii) increase the principal amount of such Permanent Regulation S Global Security by the amount of such beneficial interest.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, beneficial interests in a Temporary Regulation S Global Security may be held through the Depository only through Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., and its successors or assigns, as operator of the Euroclear System, or Clearstream Banking, , Luxembourg, and their respective direct and indirect participants.

The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the Holders of the Securities, create and issue further securities having the same terms as the Securities in all respects (except for the issue date, issue price, payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date of the Securities and, in some cases, the initial interest payment date of the Securities), so that such additional securities may be consolidated and form a single series with the Securities and have the same terms as to status, redemption or otherwise as the Securities. If the additional securities are not fungible with the previously outstanding Securities for United States federal income tax purposes, such additional securities will have a separate CUSIP number.
 
The Securities shall have the redemption features summarized in Annex A to this Global Security.
 
The provisions for defeasance and covenant defeasance set forth in Sections 1302 and 1303 of the Indenture, respectively, will apply to the Securities of this series.

Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than 66 2/3% in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

This Security is a Global Security and shall be exchangeable for Securities registered in the names of Persons other than the depository with respect to this Global Security or its nominee only if (x) such depository notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for this Global Security or at any time ceases to be a clearing agency registered as such under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (y) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that this Global Security shall be exchangeable or (z) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to the Securities. If this Global Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for Securities issuable in a minimum denomination of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, registered in such names as such depository shall direct.
 
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons and when not represented by one or more Global Securities, (a) will be issuable in a minimum denomination of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and (b) as provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, will be exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
 
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
This Security shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.
 
All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

the Company.
 
(ii)           Without limiting in any way paragraph (p)(i), no Holder may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such Holder (x) agrees to sell such Holder's securities to be covered by such registration on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Majority Holders and the Managing Underwriters and (y) completes and executes in a timely manner all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required by the Company or the Managing Underwriters in connection with such underwriting arrangements.

(b)           Each Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement (including with respect to any Prospectus delivery as contemplated in Section 4(h) hereof, each Exchanging Dealer) severally and not jointly agrees to (i) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each officer who signed the Registration Statement and each other Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, each other Indemnified Holder Party, and each Indemnified Underwriter Party, against any and all Losses, joint or several, described in the indemnity contained in paragraph (a) of this Section 6, as incurred or paid, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (including with respect to any Prospectus delivery as contemplated in Section 4(h) hereof) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity and (ii) reimburse the Company and each other aforementioned Person, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with the investigation or defending of any such Loss.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any such Holder may otherwise have.
 
(c)          Each indemnified party shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement.  The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice at the
 
indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel).  An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; , , that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party.  In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless (i) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
provided
however
 
The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any litigation, action or proceeding effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any such proceedings, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each indemnified party from and against any and all Losses by reason of such settlement or judgment.  The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of an indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceedings in respect of which indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceedings and (ii) does not include any statement as to or any admission of default, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
The indemnity, reimbursement and contribution obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to an indemnified party and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives of the Company and any indemnified party.
 
(d)           In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 6 is unavailable to (except in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement) or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the aggregate Losses to which such indemnified party may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, from the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses.  If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also
 
the relative fault of such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements, omissions, actions or failures to act that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the sum of (x) the aggregate principal amount of Securities issued in the Exchange Offers (before deducting expenses) and (y) the total amount of Additional Interest which the Company was not required to pay as a result of registering the Securities covered by the Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses, and benefits received by (i) any Holders shall be deemed to be equal to the value of receiving Securities or Exchange Securities, as applicable, registered under the Securities Act and (ii) any underwriters shall be deemed to equal the total underwriting discounts and commissions actually received by the underwriters in connection with the resale of securities.  Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any other alleged conduct relates to information provided by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, or by the indemnified party, on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and the opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission.  The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 6, each Person who controls a Holder or an underwriter, as the case may be, within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder or underwriter, as the case may be, and each Person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
 
(e)           If at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a) or (b) effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement.
 
(f)            The provisions of this Section 6 will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder, the Company or any underwriter or any of the officers, directors or controlling Persons referred to in this Section 6, and will survive the sale by a Holder of securities covered by a Registration Statement.

(iii)          the Exchange Offer Registration Statement has become effective but the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated on or prior to the Registered Exchange Offer Completion Deadline;

(v)           after a Shelf Registration Statement, if applicable, has become effective, such Shelf Registration Statement thereafter ceases to be effective or usable in connection with resales of the Securities for more than 180 days, whether or not consecutive, in any twelve-month period at any time that the Company is obligated to maintain the effectiveness thereof pursuant to this Agreement.
 
(b)           Additional Interest shall accrue (in addition to stated interest on the Securities) on the aggregate principal amount of the Securities affected by the Registration Default from and including the date on which the first such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all Registration Defaults have been cured, at a rate per annum equal to (i) 0.25% of the principal amount of the Securities, (ii) an additional 0.25% of the principal amount of the Securities from and during any period in which the Registration Default has continued for more than 90 days.  In no event shall the rate at which Additional Interest accrues exceed 0.50% per annum.  Accrued Additional Interest, if any, shall be paid on the Securities in cash in arrears semiannually on the interest payment dates for the Securities.  Any accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest) on any of the Securities shall, upon the issuance of an Exchange Security in exchange therefor cease to be payable to the Holder thereof but such accrued and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest) shall be payable on the next interest payment date for such Exchange Security to the Holder thereof on the related record date.  Any Additional Interest payable by the Company shall constitute liquidated damages and shall be the exclusive remedy, monetary or otherwise, available to Holders with respect to a Registration Default.
