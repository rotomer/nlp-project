If (i) the Company determines (upon the advice of counsel and after consideration of other certifications and evidence as the Company may reasonably require) that a Security of this series is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or a successor provision) without being subject to any conditions as provided in Rule 144 and that the legend set forth on the face hereof is no longer necessary or appropriate in order to ensure that subsequent transfers of the Security (or a beneficial interest therein) are effected in compliance with the Securities Act, (ii) a Security of this series is sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or (iii) a Security of this series is validly tendered and exchanged for a Security of this series pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, then, in each such case, the Company may instruct the Trustee to cancel such Security and issue to the Holder thereof (or to its transferee) a new Security of like tenor and amount of this series, registered in the name of the Holder thereof (or its transferee), that does not bear the legend set forth on the face hereof, and the Trustee shall comply with such instruction.
This Security shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been manually signed by or on behalf of the Trustee under the Indenture.
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the Securities), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of May 1, 1987 (as supplemented, the Indenture), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association (as successor to Citibank, N.A., as successor to First National Bank of Chicago), as trustee (the Trustee, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.

The Company shall make payments of Additional Interest in accordance with the provisions set forth herein for the payment of regular interest.
The Company may from time to time, without notice to or the consent of the Holders of the Securities, create and issue further securities having the same terms as the Securities in all respects (except for the issue date, issue price, payment of interest accruing prior to the issue date
4
of the Securities and, in some cases, the initial interest payment date of the Securities), so that such additional securities may be consolidated and form a single series with the Securities and have the same terms as to status, redemption or otherwise as the Securities. If the additional securities are not fungible with the previously outstanding Securities for United States federal income tax purposes, such additional securities will have a separate CUSIP number.
The Securities shall have the redemption features summarized in Annex A to this Global Security.
The provisions for defeasance and covenant defeasance set forth in Sections 1302 and 1303 of the Indenture, respectively, will apply to the Securities of this series.
If any Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than 66 2/3% in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.

This Security is a Global Security and shall be exchangeable for Securities registered in the names of Persons other than the depository with respect to this Global Security or its nominee only if (x) such depository notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to
5
continue as depository for this Global Security or at any time ceases to be a clearing agency registered as such under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (y) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that this Global Security shall be exchangeable or (z) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to the Securities. If this Global Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for Securities issuable in a minimum denomination of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, registered in such names as such depository shall direct.
The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without coupons and when not represented by one or more Global Securities, (a) will be issuable in a minimum denomination of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and (b) as provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, will be exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
