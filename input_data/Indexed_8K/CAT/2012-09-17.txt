The 2010 Facility Amendment extends the expiration date of the Four-Year Facility to September 15, 2015 and the 2011 Facility Amendment extends the expiration date of the Five-Year Facility to September 15, 2017. The Amendments also modify the terms of the Four-Year Facility and the Five-Year Facility to be consistent with certain terms and conditions of the 364-Day Facility, including, without limitation, terms and conditions of advances, use of proceeds and Borrower representations and warranties.
The Credit Facilities are available for general corporate purposes. The Borrowers have not drawn on the Credit Facilities.
The Credit Facilities contain certain representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including financial covenants.

SECTION 2.02.    
Making the Revolving Credit Advances
.
(a)    Each Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of the proposed Revolving Credit Borrowing (in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Advances), or not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Revolving Credit Borrowing (in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances), by a Borrower to the Agent, which shall give to each Bank prompt notice thereof by telecopy. Each such notice of a Revolving Credit Borrowing (a 
Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing
) shall be by telecopy, confirmed immediately in writing, in substantially the form of
Exhibit B-1
hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) Borrower, (ii) date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, (iii) Type of Revolving Credit Advances comprising such Revolving Credit Borrowing, (iv) in the case of a proposed Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, Agreed Currency of such Advances, (v) aggregate amount of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, (vi) Interest Period for the Revolving Credit Advances and (vii) account to which the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be made available. In the case of each proposed Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of such Banks ratable share of such Revolving Credit Borrowing based upon the Available Revolving Credit Commitments of the Banks, and in the case of a proposed Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the applicable interest rate under
Section 2.07(b)
. Each Bank shall, before 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the applicable Payment Office, in the Agreed Currency and in same day funds, such Banks ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing. After the Agents receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in
Article III
, the Agent will promptly make such same day funds available to the account specified by the applicable Borrower in the Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing.
(b)    Each Notice of a Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower submitting such Notice. In the case of any Revolving Credit Borrowing which the related Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the requesting Borrower shall indemnify each Bank against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Bank as a direct result of the failure of such Borrower, for any reason other than a default by such Bank, to borrow the requested Revolving Credit Advances on the date specified in the Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing. Such indemnification shall include, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank to fund the Advance to be made by such Bank as part of such Borrowing;
provided
,
however
, that any indemnification for such losses, costs and expenses shall be limited to an amount equal to (i) the principal amount of the Advance to be made by such Bank
times
(ii) the number of days in the requested Interest Period, divided by 360
times
(iii) the interest differential between the interest rate based on the Eurocurrency Rate which would have applied to such Advance and the rate of interest which would apply if such Borrower had requested on the date of the requested Revolving Credit Borrowing a Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Advances of the same Type and Agreed Currency for a period equal to the requested Interest Period. A
23
certificate describing in reasonable detail the amount of such losses, costs and expenses, submitted to such Borrower and the Agent by such Bank, shall create a rebuttable presumption of such losses, costs or expenses.
(c)    Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the time of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that such Bank will not make available to the Agent such Banks ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this
Section 2.02
and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Bank and such Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Revolving Credit Advances comprising such Revolving Credit Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, together with interest thereon as required in the immediately preceding sentence, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Banks Revolving Credit Advance as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement and such Bank shall be entitled to all rights in respect of such Revolving Credit Advance, including the right to receive interest from the date funds in connection therewith shall have been made available to such Borrower. If such Borrower shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such repayment shall not relieve such Bank from its obligation to make its ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing available to such Borrower. Nothing contained herein shall impair the right of such Borrower to the performance by any Bank of such Banks obligations hereunder. Subject to
Section 2.18
, in the event that any Bank shall at any time fail to make its ratable portion of any Revolving Credit Borrowing available to the Agent for disbursement to such Borrower, the Agent shall make inquiry of such Bank as to the circumstances giving rise to such failure and shall promptly advise such Borrower of the response, if any, the Agent shall have received in connection with such inquiry;
provided
that no failure or delay on the part of the Agent to make such inquiry shall relieve such Borrower or such Bank of its obligation to repay any amount made available by the Agent to such Borrower in anticipation of receiving such Banks portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing.
(d)    The failure of any Bank to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by it as part of any Revolving Credit Borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Credit Advance on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such other Bank on the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing. Nothing contained herein shall impair the rights and remedies of the Borrower requesting any Revolving Credit Borrowing against any Bank under applicable law as a result of such Banks failure to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by it as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing.
(e)    Any Bank may make, carry or transfer Advances at, to or for the account of, any of its branch offices or the office of an Affiliate at the Bank;
provided
,
however
, no
24
Affiliate of any Bank shall be deemed a party to this Agreement or shall have any rights, liability or obligation under this Agreement unless such Bank and such Affiliate shall have executed and delivered, and the Agent shall have accepted, an Assignment and Acceptance in accordance with
Section 8.07
, and then such Affiliate shall have rights and obligations hereunder only to the extent contemplated therein.
(f)    Each Bank shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Bank resulting from each Advance made by such Bank from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank from time to time hereunder. The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (a) the amount of each Advance made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period with respect thereto, (b) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the applicable Borrower to each Bank hereunder and (c) the amount of any sum received by the Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent, as applicable, hereunder from the applicable Borrower and each Banks share thereof. Entries recorded pursuant to the foregoing shall be
prima
facie
evidence of the existence and amounts of the Borrowers obligations;
provided
,
however
, that the failure of the Agent or any Bank to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower to repay its obligations hereunder in accordance with their terms. Any Bank may request that its Revolving Credit Advances (or Term Loan Advances, if applicable) be evidenced by a promissory note in substantially the form of Exhibit A (a 
Note
). In such event, the applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Bank such Note payable to the order of such Bank. Thereafter, the Advances evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (prior to any assignment pursuant to
Section 8.07
) be represented by one or more Notes payable to the order of the payee named therein, except to the extent that any such Bank subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Advances once again be evidenced as described above.
SECTION 2.03.    
Voluntary Conversion or Continuation of Term Loan Advances

Section 2.01(a)
,
Section 2.03B
or

, as applicable. Each such notice of a Conversion or continuation shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion or continuation, (ii) the Advances to be Converted or continued, (iii) in the case of
25
a Conversion into Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the Agreed Currency of such Advances, and (iv) the Interest Period for the Advances.

provided
,
further
, that any such Redenomination of Advances shall be in the minimum amounts and increments specified in
Section 2.01(a)
,
Section 2.03B
or
Section 2.03D
, as applicable; and
provided
,
further
, that no Advance may be Redenominated at any time that an Event of Default or unmatured Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Each such notice of request of a Redenomination (a 
Notice of Redenomination
) shall be by telecopy, confirmed immediately in writing, specifying (i) the Advances comprising the Borrowing to be Redenominated, (ii) the date of the proposed Redenomination, (iii) the currency into which such Advances are to be Redenominated, and (iv) the Interest Period for such Advances upon being so Redenominated. Subject to the provisions of
Section 2.10
and of the second proviso in this
Section 2.03(b)
, each Advance so requested to be Redenominated will be Redenominated, on the date specified therefor in such Notice of Redenomination, into an equivalent amount thereof in the Agreed Currency requested in such Notice of Redenomination, such equivalent amount to be determined on such date in accordance with
Section 2.15(b)
, and, upon being so Redenominated, will have an initial Interest Period as requested in such notice of Redenomination. No Revolving Credit Advance or Term Loan Advance that is not a Japan Local Currency Advance may be Converted at any time into a Japan Local Currency Advance, and no Japan Local Currency Advance may be Converted at any time into a Revolving Credit Advance or a Term Loan Advance that is not a Japan Local Currency Advance. No Revolving Credit Advance or Term Loan Advance that is not a Local Currency Advance may be Converted at any time into a Local Currency Advance, and no Local Currency Advance may be Converted at any time into a Revolving Credit Advance or a Term Loan Advance that is not a Local Currency Advance.

Section 1.01
and the provisions of this
Section 2.03
, or is not entitled to Convert, Redenominate or continue such Advances into or as Eurocurrency Rate Advances or TIBO Rate Advances pursuant to

or
Section 2.10
, the Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Banks and such Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into Base Rate Advances or Japan Base Rate Advances, as applicable.

that the aggregate amount of the Allocated Commitments of the Banks to (i) Caterpillar shall not be reduced to an amount which is less than the aggregate principal Dollar Amount of the Advances to Caterpillar then outstanding and (ii) CFSC shall not be reduced to an amount which is less than the sum of the aggregate principal Dollar Amount of the Advances to CFSC and the Local Currency Advances
31
and Japan Local Currency Advances then outstanding, and
provided
,
further
, that each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple thereof. Any such reduction of each Banks Commitment will be an automatic reduction of such Banks Revolving Credit Commitment in an identical amount.
(b)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the acquisition of one Bank by another Bank, or the merger, consolidation or other combination of any two or more Banks (any such acquisition, merger, consolidation or other combination being referred to hereinafter as a 
Combination
 and each Bank which is a party to such Combination being hereinafter referred to as a 
Combined Bank
), the Borrowers may notify the Agent that they desire to reduce the Commitment of the Bank surviving such Combination (the 
Surviving Bank
) to an amount equal to the Commitment of that Combined Bank which had the largest Commitment of each of the Combined Banks party to such Combination (such largest Commitment being the 
Surviving Commitment
 and the Commitments of the other Combined Banks being hereinafter referred to, collectively, as the 
Retired Commitments
). If the Majority Banks (determined as set forth below) and the Agent agree to such reduction in the Surviving Banks Commitment, then (i) the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall be reduced by the Retired Commitments effective upon the effective date of the Combination,
provided
, that, on or before such date the Borrowers have paid in full the outstanding principal amount of the Advances of each of the Combined Banks other than the Combined Bank whose Commitment is the Surviving Commitment, (ii) from and after the effective date of such reduction, the Surviving Bank shall have no obligation with respect to the Retired Commitments, and (iii) the Borrowers shall notify the Agent whether they wish such reduction to be a permanent reduction or a temporary reduction. If such reduction is to be a temporary reduction, then the Borrowers shall be responsible for finding one or more financial institutions (each, a 
Replacement Bank
), acceptable to the Agent (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), willing to assume the obligations of a Bank hereunder with aggregate Commitments up to the amount of the Retired Commitments. The Agent may require the Replacement Banks to execute such documents, instruments or agreements as the Agent deems necessary or desirable to evidence such Replacement Banks agreement to become parties hereunder. For purposes of this
Section 2.05(b)
, Majority Banks shall be determined as if the reduction in the aggregate amount of the Commitments requested by the Borrowers had occurred (
i.e.
, the Combined Banks shall be deemed to have a single Commitment equal to the Surviving Commitment and the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall be deemed to have been reduced by the Retired Commitments).
(c)    The Borrowers shall have the right prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date, upon at least five (5) Business Days notice to the Agent, to add one or more bank or banks as new Banks hereunder, or to increase the Commitment of any existing Bank with such existing Banks prior written consent, pursuant to the terms hereof (any such addition of a new Bank or increase in the Commitment of an existing Bank upon the request of the Borrowers pursuant to this
Section
2.05(c)
being referred to as a 
Bank Addition
);
provided
that (i) such proposed Bank, in the case of a bank not already a Bank hereunder, is acceptable to the Agent (the acceptance of the Agent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) after giving effect to the proposed Bank Addition, no Banks Commitment would exceed 20% of the Total Commitment; and (iii) after giving effect to the proposed Bank Addition, the Total Commitment would not exceed 120% of the Total Commitment on (A) the Closing Date, if such Bank
32
Addition is to occur prior to any Extension Request having been made pursuant to
Section 2.16(a)
and (B) the date of the most recent Extension Request, if such Bank Addition is to occur after any Extension Request has been made. Each notice of a proposed Bank Addition (a 
Notice of Bank Addition
) shall be by telecopy, confirmed immediately in writing, in substantially the form of
Exhibit B-5
hereto, specifying therein (i) the name and address of the proposed Added Bank, (ii) the date on which the Borrowers wish such Bank Addition to become effective, and (iii) the amount of the Commitment such Added Bank would have hereunder after giving effect to such Bank Addition. If the conditions set forth in the proviso contained in the first sentence of this
Section 2.05(c)
have been satisfied, the Agent shall forward to such Added Bank and the Borrowers for execution by such Added Bank and the Borrowers an Assumption and Acceptance. The Added Bank shall, upon such execution, return the executed Assumption and Acceptance to the Agent, for the Agents acceptance thereof, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500.
Upon such execution, delivery and acceptance, from and after the effective date specified in each Assumption and Acceptance, the Added Bank shall, in addition to the rights and obligations hereunder held by it immediately prior to such effective date (if any), have the rights and obligations hereunder that have been assumed by it pursuant to such Assumption and Acceptance and, in the case of a bank not previously a Bank hereunder, shall become a Bank hereunder.
By executing and delivering an Assumption and Acceptance, each Added Bank confirms to and agrees with each party hereto as follows: (i) neither the Agent nor any Bank makes any representation or warranty, nor assumes any responsibility with respect to, any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and (ii) neither the Agent nor any Bank makes any representation or warranty, nor assumes any responsibility with respect to, the financial condition of any Borrower or the performance or observance by any Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto.
The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in
Section 8.02
a copy of each Assumption and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it. Such copies shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers or any Bank at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
Upon its receipt of an Assumption and Acceptance executed by an Added Bank and the Borrowers, the Agent shall, if such Assumption and Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of
Exhibit C-2
hereto, (i) accept such Assumption and Acceptance, and (ii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrowers. Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice, if requested by an Added Bank, each Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent a new Note or Notes to the order of such Added Bank. Such new Note or Notes shall be dated the effective date of such Assumption and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of
Exhibit A
hereto.
33
(d)    If there are any Revolving Credit Advances outstanding on the effective date of any Assumption and Acceptance, the Added Bank shall purchase from the other Banks such participations in such Revolving Credit Advances as shall be necessary to cause such Added Bank to share ratably (based on the proportion that such Added Banks Revolving Credit Commitment bears to the Total Revolving Credit Commitment after giving effect to the Bank Addition) in each such Revolving Credit Advance. To purchase such participations, the Added Bank shall before 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the effective date of its Assumption and Acceptance, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at its address referred to in
Section 8.02
, in the applicable Agreed Currency and in same day funds, such Added Banks ratable portion (based on the proportion that such Added Banks Revolving Credit Commitment (or the increase in such Added Banks Revolving Credit Commitment, in the case of an Added Bank which is an existing Bank hereunder) bears to the Total Revolving Credit Commitment after giving effect to the Bank Addition) of each Revolving Credit Borrowing then outstanding, together with an amount equal to such ratable portion of the interest which has accrued to such date and remains unpaid on such Revolving Credit Borrowing. After the Agents receipt of such funds, the Agent will promptly make such same day funds available to the account of each Bank in an amount to such Banks ratable portion of such payment by the Added Bank. In addition, if such Added Bank acquires a Local Currency Commitment or a Japan Local Currency Commitment, automatically upon and simultaneously with becoming an Added Bank, such Added Bank shall have acquired a ratable risk participation in all then outstanding Local Currency Advances or Japan Local Currency Advances, as applicable, with such ratable risk participation based on such Added Banks Local Currency Commitment or Japan Local Currency Commitment as a fraction of the aggregate of all Local Currency Commitments or Japan Local Currency Commitments, as applicable.
SECTION 2.06.    
Repayment of Advances
. Each Borrower shall repay the principal amount (or the portion thereof remaining after giving effect to any earlier partial prepayments thereof) of each Advance made to such Borrower by each Bank (other than a Term Loan Advance) on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance. Each Borrower shall repay the principal amount (or the portion thereof remaining after giving effect to any earlier partial repayment thereof) of each Term Loan Advance outstanding to such Borrower from each Bank on the Term Loan Repayment Date.
SECTION 2.07.    
Interest on Advances
. Each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance made to such Borrower by each Bank from the date of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:
(a)    
Base Rate Advances
. If such Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during the Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of the Base Rate in effect from time to time
plus
the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable on the last day of such Interest Period (or, with respect to any portion thereof that shall be prepaid pursuant to
Section 2.09
or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, on the date of such prepayment); or if such Advance is a Japan Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during the Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of the Japan Base Rate in effect from time to time
plus
the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable on the last day of such Interest Period (or with respect to any portion thereof that shall be prepaid pursuant to
Section 2.09
or otherwise in accordance with
34
the terms of this Agreement or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, on the date of such prepayment).
(b)    
Eurocurrency Rate Advances
. If such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during the Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period
plus
the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable on the last day of such Interest Period (or, with respect to any portion thereof that shall be prepaid pursuant to
Section 2.09
or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, on the date of such prepayment) and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on the day which occurs during such Interest Period three months from the first day of such Interest Period.
(c)    
TIBO Rate Advances
. If such Advance is a TIBO Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during the Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of the TIBO Rate for such Interest Period
plus
the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time, payable on the last day of such Interest Period (or, with respect to any portion thereof that shall be prepaid pursuant to
Section 2.09
or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, on the date of such prepayment) and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on the day which occurs during such Interest Period three months from the first day of such Interest Period.
(d)    
Post-Default Interest
. Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of any Event of Default, the unpaid principal amount of each Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum otherwise required to be paid on such Advance in accordance with subsection (a), (b) or (c) above;
provided
that any amount of principal which is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest, from the date on which such amount is due until such amount is paid in full, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to the greater of (x) 2% per annum above the Base Rate in effect from time to time and (y) 2% per annum above the rate per annum required to be paid on such Advance immediately prior to the date on which such amount became due.
SECTION 2.08.    
Interest Rate Determination
. (a) If, pursuant to the definition of Eurocurrency Base Rate, quotes from the Reference Banks are required, each Reference Bank shall furnish to the Agent timely information for the purpose of determining the Eurocurrency Rate. If any of the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the Agent for the purpose of determining any such interest rate, the Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining Reference Banks.
(b)    The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrowers and the Banks (or the Local Currency Banks or Japan Local Currency Banks, as applicable) of the applicable interest rate determined by the Agent for purposes of Section 2.07(a) or (b), and the applicable rate, if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of determining the applicable interest rate(s) under Section 2.07(b) (or by each Japan Local Currency Bank for the purpose of determining the applicable interest rate under Section 2.07(c), if applicable).
35
SECTION 2.09.    
Prepayments of Advances
. (a) Any Borrower may, upon at least two (2) Business Days notice to the Agent stating (i) the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment and (ii) the Advances (which shall be part of the same Borrowing) to which such prepayment is to be applied, and if such notice is given such Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amounts of the Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid;
provided
,
however
, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal Dollar Amount of not less than $10,000,000 and in an integral Dollar Amount multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (y) in the case of any such prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Advance or a TIBO Rate Advance, such Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the applicable Banks in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 8.04(b)
.
(b)    If on any date that the Dollar Amount of (i) Eurocurrency Rate Advances outstanding in an Agreed Currency, (ii) Local Currency Advances or (iii) Japan Local Currency Advances, is determined pursuant to Section 2.15 (each such date, a Computation Date), it is determined that as a result of currency fluctuations with respect to the Advances to which such Computation Date applies, the aggregate Dollar Amount of (x) all outstanding Advances exceeds the Total Commitment, or (y) all outstanding Revolving Credit Obligations exceeds the Total Revolving Credit Commitment, the Borrowers shall on such date prepay (without premium or penalty other than any payment required pursuant to Section 8.04(b)) an aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Advances (or Term Loan Advances, if applicable) ratably to the Banks in an amount equal to or, at the option of the Borrowers, greater than such excess, with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid. For purposes of the determination referred to in the previous sentence, if a Disqualifying Event of the type described in clause (ii) of the definition of Eligible Currency exists, then such determination shall be made in consultation with the Reference Banks using any method they deem reasonably appropriate, and such determination shall be conclusive. The Borrowers may determine which Borrowing such prepayment shall be allocated to, and any such prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be subject to the provisions of Section 8.04(b).
SECTION 2.10.    
Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy; Illegality
. (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, to the extent already included in the Eurocurrency Rate Reserve Percentage) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Advances or TIBO Rate Advances, then the applicable Borrower shall from time to time, upon written demand by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increased cost;
provided
, that (x) such Bank shall have certified in writing to the applicable Borrower that it is generally seeking, or intends to generally seek, comparable compensation from similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities (to the extent such Bank has the right under such similar credit facilities to do so) with respect to such change regarding such increased cost and (y) such additional amounts shall not be duplicative of any amounts to the extent otherwise paid by the applicable Borrower under any other provision of
36
this Agreement (including, without limitation, any reserve requirements included in determining the Eurocurrency Rate). A certificate describing in reasonable detail the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrowers and the Agent by such Bank, shall create a rebuttable presumption of such increased cost. If any such increase in cost is attributable to specific Advances made to a particular Borrower, compensation for such increased cost shall be paid by such Borrower (or if such Borrower is CIF or CFC, by CFSC). In all other cases, compensation for such increased cost shall be paid by Caterpillar.
(b)    If any Bank determines that compliance with any law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Bank or by any Person controlling such Bank and that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Banks Advances or commitment to lend hereunder, then, upon written demand by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the applicable Borrower shall immediately pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank, from time to time as specified by such Bank, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank (or, if applicable, such Person controlling such Bank) in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Bank reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Banks commitment to lend hereunder;
provided
, that (x) such Bank shall have certified in writing to the applicable Borrower that it is generally seeking, or intends to generally seek, comparable compensation from similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities (to the extent such Bank has the right under such similar credit facilities to do so) with respect to such change regarding such increased cost and (y) such additional amounts shall not be duplicative of any amounts to the extent otherwise paid by the applicable Borrower under any other provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any reserve requirements included in determining the Eurocurrency Rate). A certificate describing in reasonable detail such amounts submitted to the applicable Borrower by such Bank shall create a rebuttable presumption of such amounts. If any such increase in capital is attributable to specific Advances made to a particular Borrower or to the Allocated Commitments to a particular Borrower or Borrowers, compensation for such increase in capital shall be paid by such Borrower (or if such Borrower is CIF or CFC, by CFSC). In all other cases, compensation for such increased capital shall be paid by Caterpillar.
(c)    If any Bank shall notify the Agent that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Bank or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Local Currency Advances, TIBO Rate Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Local Currency Advances, TIBO Rate Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances hereunder, (i) all Local Currency Advances, TIBO Rate Advances and Eurocurrency Rate Advances of such Bank to any Borrower then outstanding shall be redenominated into Dollars and begin bearing interest at the Base Rate (or in the case of TIBO Rate Advances, be maintained in Japanese Yen but begin bearing interest at the Japan Base Rate) for the Interest Period selected by such Borrower in accordance with the procedures of Section 2.02(a) or Section 2.03(a), notwithstanding any prior election by such Borrower to the contrary, either (x) one Business Day after such notice, or (y) if such Bank may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Advances at the applicable
37
Eurocurrency Rate or TIBO Rate to a later day during such Interest Period, on such later day (in which case such Borrower shall in addition reimburse such Bank for any resulting losses as provided in Section 8.04(b)) and (ii) the obligation of such Bank to make Local Currency Advances, TIBO Rate Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, as applicable, shall be suspended until such Bank shall notify the Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and until such notification has been given (i) in the case of Local Currency Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, such Bank shall fund its Local Currency Advance made in connection with each Local Currency Borrowing and Revolving Credit Advance made in connection with each Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Eurocurrency Rate Advances as a Base Rate Advance, and (ii) in the case of a Japan Local Currency Advance, the Japan Local Currency Banks shall fund each Japan Local Currency Borrowing with Japan Base Rate Advances.
(d)    If the Majority Banks (or the Majority Local Currency Banks, as applicable) shall, at least one (1) Business Day before the requested date of, or the proposed Conversion, Redenomination or continuation of the Advances comprising all or part of, any requested Revolving Credit Borrowing, Term Loan Borrowing or Local Currency Borrowing (or on the date of such Local Currency Borrowing, in the case of a Same Day Local Currency Borrowing), notify the Agent that the Eurocurrency Rate for Eurocurrency Rate Advances comprising such Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Banks (or such Majority Local Currency Banks, as applicable) of making or funding their respective Eurocurrency Rate Advances for such Revolving Credit Borrowing, Local Currency Borrowing or Term Loan Borrowing, the Agent shall so notify the Borrowers, and (1) each such outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into (or if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, shall continue as), and with respect to a requested Advance as part of a requested Borrowing, such Advance shall be, a Base Rate Advance, and (2) the right of the requesting Borrower to select the Eurocurrency Rate for such Borrowing, and the right of any Borrower to Convert Advances into, or continue Advances as, Eurocurrency Rate Advances, or to select the Eurocurrency Rate for any subsequent Borrowing, shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a Base Rate Advance.
(e)    If the Majority Japan Local Currency Banks shall, at least one (1) Business Day before the requested date of, or the proposed Conversion or continuation of the Advances comprising all or part of any requested Japan Local Currency Borrowing (or on the date of such Borrowing if it is being requested on a same-day basis), notify the Japan Local Currency Agent that the TIBO Rate for TIBO Rate Advances comprising such Borrowing will not adequately reflect the cost to such Majority Japan Local Currency Banks of making or funding their respective TIBO Rate Advances for such Japan Local Currency Borrowing, the Japan Local Currency Agent shall so notify CFC and (1) each such outstanding TIBO Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert (or if such Advance is then a Japan Base Rate Advance, shall continue as), and with respect to a requested Japan Local Currency Advance as part of a requested Borrowing, such Japan Local Currency Advance shall be a Japan Base Rate Advance, and (2) the right of CFC to select the TIBO Rate for such Borrowing, and the right of CFC to Convert Advances into, or continue
38
Advances as, TIBO Rate Advances, or select the TIBO Rate for any subsequent Borrowing, shall be suspended until the Japan Local Currency Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Japan Local Currency Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and each Advance comprising such Borrowing shall be a Japan Base Rate Advance.
(f)    In the event that a Bank (an 
Affected Bank
) either demands payment from any Borrower at any time pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this
Section 2.10
or fails to consent to any extension of the Current Termination Date requested by the Borrowers under
Section 2.16
, then from such time and for so long thereafter as such Bank remains an Affected Bank, the Borrowers may either (1) terminate such Affected Banks Commitment hereunder or (2) replace such Affected Bank with another bank or banks acceptable to the Agent (the consent of the Agent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);
provided
that (i) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time, (ii) in the case of clause (2), the Affected Bank and the replacement bank(s) execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance and such other documents, agreements and instruments as the Agent may reasonably require in order to effectuate the assumption by such replacement bank(s) of the Affected Banks obligations hereunder, and (iii) the Affected Bank has been paid all amounts due to it hereunder. In no event shall the replacement of an Affected Bank impair or otherwise affect the obligation of the applicable Borrower or Borrowers to make the payments demanded by such Affected Bank pursuant to this
Section 2.10
and, if applicable,
Section 8.04(b)
.
(g)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives relating to capital adequacy promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in law and be eligible for redress pursuant to clause (a), (b) and (c), as applicable, of this
Section 2.10
, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.
SECTION 2.11.    
Payments and Computations
.
(a)    The Borrowers shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes (except with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to Local Currency Advances, Japan Local Currency Advances or Advances denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars), without set-off, deduction, or counterclaim, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Agent in same day funds by deposit of such funds to the Agents account maintained at the Payment Office for Dollars in New York City. The Borrowers shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to Advances (other than Local Currency Advances or Japan Local Currency Advances) denominated in an Agreed Currency other than Dollars, without set-off, deduction, or counterclaim, not later than 11:00 A.M. (London time) on the day when due in such Agreed Currency to the Agent in same day funds by deposit of such funds to the Agents account maintained at the Payment Office for such Agreed Currency. CIF shall make each payment under the Local Currency Addendum with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to Local Currency Advances without set-off, deduction, or counterclaim, not later than 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the day
39
when due in the applicable Local Currency to the Local Currency Agent in same day funds by deposit of such funds to the Local Currency Agents account maintained at the Payment Office for such Local Currency. CFC shall make each payment under the Japan Local Currency Addendum with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to Japan Local Currency Advances, without set-off, deduction, or counterclaim, not later than 11:00 a.m. (Tokyo time) on the day when due in Japanese Yen to the Japan Local Currency Agent in same day funds by deposit of such funds to the Japan Local Currency Agents account at the Payment Office set forth in the Japan Local Currency Addendum. The Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent, as applicable, will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(c)
,
2.05(d)
,
2.10
,
2.12
or
8.04
) to the applicable Banks for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Bank to such Bank for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the foregoing, if an event of the type described in clause (i) of the definition of Eligible Currency is continuing, any principal or interest in respect of any Advances made in such currency may be repaid in Dollars.
(b)    All computations of interest based on the Base Rate determined pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of the definition thereof shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be; all computations of interest on Local Currency Advances in Pounds Sterling shall be made by the Local Currency Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be; all computations of interest on Japan Local Currency Advances based on the Japan Base Rate shall be made by the Japan Local Currency Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be; and all computations of interest based on the Eurocurrency Rate (except in the case of Local Currency Advances in Pounds Sterling), the TIBO Rate or the Federal Funds Rate, and all computations of the Commitment Fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or Commitment Fees are payable. Each determination by the Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent, as the case may be, of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
(c)    Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or Commitment Fees, as the case may be;
provided
,
however
, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Advances or TIBO Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day and such contraction of time shall in such case reduce the days included in the computation of payment of interest.
(d)    Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be
40
distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent that such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.
SECTION 2.12.    
Taxes
. (a) Any and all payments by any of the Borrowers hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or under each of the Notes shall be made, in accordance with
Section 2.11
, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding
, in the case of each Bank, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent and the Agent, taxes imposed on its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Bank, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Bank, taxes imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such Banks Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such nonexcluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as 
Taxes
). If any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or under any Note to any Bank, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent or the Agent, (i) the sum payable by such Borrower shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section 2.12
) such Bank, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent or the Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b)    In addition, the Borrowers agree to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or under the Notes or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as 
Other Taxes
). If any such Other Taxes are attributable to a specific Borrower, they shall be paid by such Borrower (or in the case of CFC or CIF, by CFSC). In all other cases, they shall be paid by Caterpillar.
(c)    Each Borrower will indemnify each Bank, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent and the Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section 2.12
) paid by such Bank, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Bank, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.
41
(d)    Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Borrower paying such Taxes will furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in
Section 8.02
, a copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof;
provided
,
however
, that such copy shall be furnished solely for the purpose of enabling the Agent to verify the payment of such Taxes by such Borrower as required above. If no Taxes are payable in respect of any payment hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or under the Notes, the Borrowers will furnish to the Agent, at such address, a certificate from each appropriate taxing authority, or an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Agent, in either case stating that such payment is exempt from or not subject to Taxes;
provided
,
however
, that if any Bank, the Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent, as a recipient of payments called for hereunder, shall be exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of any Taxes, particularly those imposed by way of withholding, whether by virtue of the provisions of a relevant treaty or otherwise, it shall be incumbent upon such Bank, the Agent, the Local Currency Agent or the Japan Local Currency Agent to (a) so inform the Borrowers, (b) furnish to the Borrowers whatever certification or other documentation may be required by law or regulation to establish such exemption or reduced rate, and (c) cooperate with the Borrowers in any and all other respects to the extent necessary to establish such exemption or eligibility for reduced rate.
(e)    Any Bank whose Advances have resulted in the imposition of Taxes shall use its best efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to take such steps as would eliminate or reduce the amount of such Taxes;
provided
that no such steps shall be required to be taken if, in the reasonable judgment of such Bank, such steps would be disadvantageous to such Bank.
(f)    Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrowers hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrowers contained in this
Section 2.12
shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum and under the Notes.
SECTION 2.13.    
Sharing of Payments, Etc
. If any Bank shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) on account of the Revolving Credit Advances made by it (other than pursuant to
Sections 2.02(c)
,
2.05(d)
,
2.10
,
2.12
or
8.04
) in excess of its ratable share of payments on account of the Revolving Credit Advances obtained by all the Banks, such Bank shall forthwith notify the Agent thereof and purchase from the other Banks such participations in the Revolving Credit Advances made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment ratably with each of them;
provided
,
however
, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Bank, such purchase from each Bank shall be rescinded and such Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Banks ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Banks required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant to this
Section 2.13
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
42
SECTION 2.14.    
Tax Forms
. Each Bank that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), other than any Local Currency Bank or Japan Local Currency Bank that is an Affiliate, branch or agency of a Bank, shall submit to the Borrowers and the Agent, on or before the Closing Date (or in the case of any Person becoming a Bank hereunder pursuant to
Section 2.05(c)
or
Section 8.07
, on or before the date of acceptance by the Agent of the applicable Assumption and Acceptance or Assignment and Acceptance), duly completed and signed copies of either Form W-8BEN (relating to such Bank and entitling it to a complete exemption from withholding on all amounts to be received by such Bank at any Applicable Lending Office designated by such Bank, including fees, under this Agreement) or Form W-8-ECI (relating to all amounts to be received by such Bank at any Applicable Lending Office designated by such Bank, including fees, under this Agreement) of the United States Internal Revenue Service and Form W-8BEN (relating to the foreign status exemption from United States federal income tax backup withholding), or, in any such case, such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities. Thereafter and from time to time, each such Bank shall, to the extent that it may lawfully do so, submit to the Borrowers and the Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of one or the other of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may be (i) requested by the Borrowers or the Agent from such Bank and (ii) required under thencurrent United States law or regulations to determine the United States withholding taxes on payment in respect of all amounts to be received by such Bank at any Applicable Lending Office designated by such Bank, including fees, under this Agreement. Upon the request of the Borrowers or the Agent, each Bank that is a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall submit to the Borrowers and the Agent a certificate to the effect that it is such a United States person. If any Bank determines that it is unable to submit to the Borrowers and the Agent any form or certificate that such Bank is obligated to submit pursuant to this
Section 2.14
, or that such Bank is required to withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate previously submitted, such Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent of such fact.

.
(a)    
Market Disruption
. Notwithstanding the satisfaction of all conditions referred to in
Article III
and this
Article II
with respect to any Borrowing in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, if there shall occur on or prior to the date of such Borrowing, or the continuation, Conversion or Redenomination of such Borrowing in or to an Agreed Currency other than Dollars, any change in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls which would (i) in the reasonable opinion of the Borrowers, the Majority Local Currency Banks (in the case of a Local Currency Borrowing), the Agent or the Banks having at least 66-2/3% of the Available Revolving Credit Commitments, in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing, or 66-2/3% of the then aggregate outstanding Term Loan Advances, in the case of a Term Loan Borrowing, make it impracticable for the Eurocurrency Rate Advances comprising such Borrowing to be denominated in the Agreed Currency specified by the applicable Borrower, then the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to such Borrower, the Local Currency Banks and the Banks, or the applicable Borrower shall give notice to the Agent, the Local Currency Banks and the Banks, as the case may be, and such Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall not be denominated in
43
such currency but shall be made on the date of such Borrowing, or continued, Converted or Redenominated, as applicable, on the date of such continuation, Conversion or Redenomination, in Dollars, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Notice of Borrowing, or the Dollar Amount of the Advances being continued, Converted or Redenominated, as applicable, as Base Rate Advances, unless the applicable Borrower notifies the Agent at least one (1) Business Day before such date that (x) in the case of a requested Borrowing, it elects not to borrow on such date or (y) in the case of a requested Borrowing, continuation, Conversion or Redenomination, it elects to borrow on such date in a different Agreed Currency, or continue the applicable Advances in, or Convert or Redenominate the applicable Advances to, a different Agreed Currency, in which the denomination of such Advances would in the opinion of the Agent, the Majority Local Currency Banks (in the case of a Local Currency Borrowing) or the Banks having at least 66-2/3% of the Available Revolving Credit Commitments, in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing, or 66-2/3% of the then aggregate outstanding Term Loan Advances, in the case of a Term Loan Borrowing, be practicable and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Notice of Borrowing, or the Dollar Amount of the Advances being continued, Converted or Redenominated, as applicable, or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of any Bank, make it impracticable for the Eurocurrency Rate Advance of such Bank comprising part of such Borrowing to be denominated in the Agreed Currency specified by the applicable Borrower, then the Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to such Borrower, and the Eurocurrency Rate Advance of such Bank as part of such Borrowing shall not be denominated in such currency but shall be made on the date of such Borrowing, or continued, Converted or Redenominated, as applicable, in Dollars, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount of such Banks Advance, as a Base Rate Advance, unless the applicable Borrower notifies the Agent at least one (1) Business Day before such date that (x) in the case of a requested Borrowing, it elects not to borrow on such date or (y) in the case of a requested Borrowing, continuation, Conversion or Redenomination, it elects to borrow on such date in a different Agreed Currency, or continue the applicable Advances as, or Convert or Redenominate the applicable Advances to a different Agreed Currency, in which the denomination of all such Advances as part of such Borrowing would in the opinion of the Agent, the Majority Local Currency Banks (in the case of a Local Currency Borrowing) or the Banks having at least 66-2/3% of the Available Revolving Credit Commitments, in the case of a Revolving Credit Borrowing, or 66-2/3% of the then aggregate outstanding Term Loan Advances, in the case of a Term Loan Borrowing, be practicable and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar Amount of the aggregate principal amount specified in the related Notice of Borrowing, or the Dollar Amount of the Advances being continued, Converted or Redenominated, as applicable.
(b)    
Calculation of Amounts
. Except as set forth below, all amounts referenced in this
Article II
shall be calculated using the Dollar Amount determined based upon the Equivalent Amount in effect as of the date of any determination thereof;
provided
,
however
, that to the extent any Borrower shall be obligated hereunder to pay in Dollars any Borrowing denominated in a currency other than Dollars, such amount shall be paid in Dollars using the Dollar Amount of the Borrowing (calculated based upon the Equivalent Amount in effect on the date of payment thereof). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
44
full risk of currency fluctuations shall be borne by the Borrowers and the Borrowers agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Local Currency Bank, each Japan Local Currency Bank, the Agent and the Banks from and against any loss resulting from any Borrowing denominated in a currency other than in Dollars.
SECTION 2.16.    
Extensions of the Commitments
.  
(a)    During the period from the date that is 60 days prior to the Current Termination Date to the date that is 32 days prior to the Current Termination Date, the Borrowers may, by written notice (an 
Extension Request
) given to the Agent, request that the Current Termination Date be extended. Each such Extension Request shall contemplate an extension of the Current Termination Date to a date that is not later than 364 days after the date of issuance of the Extension Confirmation Notice.
(b)    The Agent shall promptly advise each Bank, including each Local Currency Bank and each Japan Local Currency Bank, of its receipt of any Extension Request. Each Bank may, in its sole discretion, consent to a requested extension by giving written notice thereof to the Agent by not later than the Business Day (the 
Extension Confirmation Date
) immediately preceding the date that is 31 days after the date of the Extension Request but no more than 45 days prior to the Current Termination Date. Failure on the part of any Bank to respond to an Extension Request by the applicable Extension Confirmation Date shall be deemed to be a denial of such request by such Bank. If Banks having at least 50% of the Commitments at the time of the issuance of any Extension Request shall consent in writing to the requested extension, such request shall be granted with respect to each consenting Bank;
provided
,
however
, that no such consent shall be granted in connection with (i) Local Currency Advances unless Local Currency Banks having at least 50% of the Local Currency Commitments at the time of issuance of any Extension Request shall consent in writing to the requested extension and (ii) Japan Local Currency Advances unless Japan Local Currency Banks having at least 50% of the Japan Local Currency Commitments at the time of issuance of any Extension Request shall consent in writing to the requested extension. Promptly following the opening of business on the first Business Day following the applicable Extension Confirmation Date, the Agent shall notify the Borrowers in writing as to whether the requested extension has been granted (such written notice being an 
Extension Confirmation Notice
) and, if granted, such extension shall become effective upon the issuance of such Extension Confirmation Notice. The Agent shall promptly thereafter provide a copy of such Extension Confirmation Notice to each Bank.
(c)    Each Extension Confirmation Notice shall, if applicable, specify therein the date to which the Current Termination Date is to be extended in respect of each of the consenting Banks (such date being referred to herein as the 
Extended Termination Date
). The Current Termination Date with respect to (i) any Banks which shall have denied such requested extension in writing, or which shall have failed to respond to the applicable Extension Request, and (ii) all Banks, in the event that fewer than the minimum number of Banks specified above shall consent in writing to such Extension Request, shall continue to be the then existing Current Termination Date (the 
Earlier Termination Date
). The Current Termination Date with respect to those Banks which shall have consented to the applicable Extension Request, in the event that the requisite number of Banks specified above shall
45
consent in writing to such Extension Request, shall continue to be the Earlier Termination Date until the end of the day immediately preceding the Current Termination Date then in effect at which time the Current Termination Date then in effect shall become the Extended Termination Date provided for in such Extension Confirmation Notice. In no event shall the term of this Agreement, after giving effect to any extension of the Current Termination Date at any time, exceed a period of 364 days.
(d)    If fewer than all of the Banks agree to any extension of the Current Termination Date that shall have become effective in accordance with this
Section 2.16
, (i) no Advance made or to be made prior to the Earlier Termination Date shall have an Interest Period which ends after the Earlier Termination Date, (ii) all Advances, Local Currency Advances, if applicable, Japan Local Currency Advances, if applicable, and all other obligations, of the Borrower to the Banks hereunder shall be repaid in full on the Earlier Termination Date (whether from proceeds of Borrowings made on the Earlier Termination Date from the Banks having agreed to such extension or from other sources) and (iii) the Commitment, Local Currency Commitment or Japan Local Currency Commitment, as applicable, of each Bank that shall not have consented to such extension shall terminate on the Earlier Termination Date, and such Bank shall have no further obligation hereunder other than in respect of obligations expressly contemplated herein to survive the termination of this Agreement. Such Bank shall also receive from the applicable Borrower all other amounts owing to it hereunder or in connection herewith on the Earlier Termination Date.
SECTION 2.17.    
Term Loan Election
. Each of Caterpillar and CFSC, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the then effective Current Termination Date, may elect to convert, as of such Current Termination Date, the aggregate principal amount of the Advances then outstanding to it into one-year term loan Advances denominated in currencies permitted hereunder (each such Advance upon such conversion, a 
Term Loan Advance
, and such election, the 
Term Loan Election
);
provided
,
however
, that such elections shall not be available to the Borrowers, and such conversions shall not be made, if (a) an Event of Default or unmatured Event of Default has occurred and is outstanding on or prior to the date of such election or the date on which such conversion is to occur, (b) the then effective Current Termination Date has been extended, or (c) the Revolving Credit Termination Date has occurred as a result of an event described in
clause (ii)
of the definition thereof. The conversion of Advances into Term Loan Advances pursuant to a Term Loan Election shall become effective on the Current Termination Date (the 
Term Loan Effective Date
) upon the payment by the Borrower(s) making the Term Loan Election of a fee in an amount equal to 1.00% times the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan Advances on such date (the 
Term Loan Election Fee
), which Term Loan Election Fee shall be non-refundable and shall be payable in immediately available funds to the Agent, for the ratable account of each Bank. Each such Term Loan Advance shall continue to be part of the Borrowing that it was a part of at the time of the Term Loan Effective Date. The aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan Advances, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and all outstanding fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection herewith, shall be due and payable on the Term Loan Repayment Date. No amount repaid in respect of a Term Loan Advance may be reborrowed.
46
SECTION 2.18.    
Defaulting Banks
. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Bank becomes a Defaulting Bank, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Bank is a Defaulting Bank:
(a)    Such Defaulting Bank will not be entitled to any fees accruing during such period pursuant to
Section 2.04
(without prejudice to the rights of the Banks other than Defaulting Banks in respect of such fees);
(b)    (i) Any amount paid by the Borrowers or otherwise received by the Agent for the account of a Defaulting Bank under this Agreement other than any amounts representing principal or interest payable to such Defaulting Bank (whether on account of fees, indemnity payments or other amounts not constituting principal or interest) will not be paid or distributed to such Defaulting Bank, but will instead be retained by the Agent in a segregated non-interest bearing account until (subject to
Section 2.18(d)
) the termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all obligations of the Borrowers hereunder and will be applied by the Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to the making of payments from time to time in the following order of priority:
first
to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Bank to the Agent under this Agreement,
second
to the payment of post-default interest and then current interest due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Banks, ratably among them in accordance with the amounts of such interest then due and payable to them,
third
to the payment of fees then due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Banks hereunder, ratably among them in accordance with the amounts of such fees then due and payable to them,
fourth
to the ratable payment of other amounts then due and payable to the Non-Defaulting Banks, and
fifth
after the termination of the Commitments and payment in full of all obligations of the Borrowers hereunder, to pay amounts owing under this Agreement to such Defaulting Bank or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. (ii) Any amount paid by the Borrowers for the account of a Defaulting Bank representing principal or interest payable to such Defaulting Bank shall be paid to such Defaulting Bank in the same amounts and in the same manner as if such Defaulting Bank were a Non-Defaulting Bank;
(c)    The Borrowers may terminate the unused amount of the Commitment of a Defaulting Bank upon not less than three (3) Business Days prior notice to the Agent (which will promptly notify the Banks thereof), and in such event the provisions of
Section 2.18(b)
will apply to all amounts thereafter paid by the Borrowers for the account of such Defaulting Bank under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity or other amounts), provided that such termination will not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim any Borrower, the Agent or any Bank may have against such Defaulting Bank; and
(d)    In the event that the Borrowers and the Agent agree in writing in their discretion that a Bank is no longer a Defaulting Bank, the Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any amounts then held in the segregated account referred to in
Section 2.18(b)
), such Bank will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par such portion of outstanding Advances of the other Banks and/or make such other adjustments as the Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Credit Obligations of the Banks to be on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective Commitments, whereupon such Bank will cease to be a Defaulting Bank and will be
47
a Non-Defaulting Bank (and each Banks ratable portion of aggregate outstanding Advances will automatically be adjusted on a prospective basis to reflect the foregoing);
provided
that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while such Bank was a Defaulting Bank; and
provided
,
further
, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Bank to Non-Defaulting Bank will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Banks having been a Defaulting Bank.
SECTION 2.19.    
Funding Vehicle
. Each Bank may, at its option, make any Borrowing available to either CFC or CIF by causing any foreign or domestic branch or Affiliate of such Bank to make such Borrowing available; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of such Borrower to repay such Borrowing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum and the Japan Local Currency Addendum, as applicable.

If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Majority Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within 60 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (such 60-day period, the 
Bank Appointment Period

(b)    Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all notices, demands, requests, consents and other Communications described in clause (a) shall be effective (i) if delivered by hand, including any overnight courier service, upon personal delivery, (ii) if delivered by mail, when received by the intended recipient, (iii) if delivered by posting to an Approved Electronic Platform, an Internet website or a similar telecommunication device requiring that a user have prior access to such Approved Electronic Platform, website or other device (to the extent permitted by this

Nothing in this clause (c) shall prejudice the right of the Agent or any Bank to deliver any Communication to any Borrower in any manner authorized in this Agreement or to request that the Borrowers effect delivery in such manner.
(d)    Each of the Banks and each Borrower agree that the Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the Approved Electronic Communications available to the Banks by posting such Approved Electronic Communications on IntraLinks or a substantially similar electronic platform chosen by the Agent to be its electronic transmission system (the

(e)    Although the Approved Electronic Platform and its primary web portal are secured with generally-applicable security procedures and policies implemented or modified
70
by the Agent from time to time (including, as of the Closing Date, a dual firewall and a User ID/Password Authorization System) and the Approved Electronic Platform is secured through a single-user-per-deal authorization method whereby each user may access the Approved Electronic Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each of the Banks and each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution.

. No failure on the part of any party hereto to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.
SECTION 8.04.    
Costs, Expenses and Taxes
. (a) Caterpillar agrees to pay on written demand all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each of the Arrangers and each of the Co-Syndication Agents in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification and amendment of this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency
71
Addendum, the Notes and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of counsel for the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each of the Arrangers and each of the Co-Syndication Agents with respect thereto and with respect to advising the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each of the Arrangers and each of the Co-Syndication Agents as to their rights and responsibilities under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum and the Japan Local Currency Addendum. The Borrowers further agree to pay all costs and expenses, if any (including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses of the Banks), of the Agent, the Banks, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each of the Arrangers and each of the Co-Syndication Agents in connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum, the Notes and the other documents to be delivered hereunder. If any such costs or expenses are attributable to a particular Borrower, such costs or expenses shall be paid by such Borrower. In all other cases, such costs or expenses shall be paid by Caterpillar.
(b)    If any payment of principal of any Eurocurrency Rate Advance or a TIBO Rate Advance is made other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, as a result of a payment pursuant to
Section 2.09
or acceleration of the maturity of the Advances pursuant to
Section 6.01
or for any other reason, or if the Banks receive payments from an Added Bank in connection with the purchase of a participation in Eurocurrency Rate Advances by such Added Bank pursuant to
Section 2.05(d)
, the applicable Borrower shall, upon demand by any Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Bank any amounts as such Bank shall reasonably determine in good faith to be required to compensate such Bank for any additional losses, costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment. Such indemnification shall include, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any Bank to fund or maintain such Advance;
provided
,
however
, that any indemnification for such losses, costs and expenses shall be limited to an amount equal to (i) the principal amount of the Advance paid by such Borrower or the amount of the participation purchased by such Added Bank, as the case may be,
times
(ii) the number of days remaining in the Interest Period applicable to such Advance, divided by 360,
times
(iii) the interest differential between the interest rate applicable to such Advance and the rate of interest which would apply on an Advance to such Borrower of the same Type requested on the date of such payment by such Borrower for an Interest Period which most nearly approximates the remaining term of the Interest Period applicable to the Advance paid by such Borrower. A certificate describing in reasonable detail the amount of such losses, costs and expenses, and specifying therein the Type of loan in reference to which such Bank shall have made its calculations thereof (the 
Reference Investment

Each Bank agrees to immediately notify such Borrower and the Agent by telecopy after any such set-off and application made by such Bank, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set off and application. The rights of each Bank under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without
73
limitation, other rights of set-off) which such Bank may have. In the event that any Defaulting Bank exercises any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off will be paid over immediately to the Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of

(e)    Nothing in this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum shall affect any right that the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each Bank, each Local Currency Bank and each Japan Local Currency Bank may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum against any Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
SECTION 8.09.    
Caterpillar as Agent for the Borrowers
. CFSC, CIF and CFC hereby appoint Caterpillar as their agent for purposes of giving notice to or otherwise advising the Agent or the Banks in such instances where this Agreement calls for notice or advice from the Borrowers rather than from a specific Borrower (Caterpillar, in such capacity, being referred to herein as the 
Borrower Agent
). The Banks and the Agent may assume that any advice given to them by Caterpillar in respect of the Borrowers validly represents the collective decision of the Borrowers, and the Banks and the Agent may rely upon such advice in all instances. Each of CIF and CFC hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest possible extent, any defense of forum non conveniens.
SECTION 8.10.

Other Currency
), the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures, the Agent could purchase the Original Currency with the Other Currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the obligation of any Borrower in respect to any sum due in the Original Currency to the Agent or any Bank shall, notwithstanding any judgment in an Other Currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Agent or such Bank, as applicable, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Other Currency, the Agent or such Bank, as applicable, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Original Currency with the Other Currency; if the amount of the Original Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Agent or such Bank, as applicable, in the Original Currency, the applicable Borrower or Borrowers agree, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Agent or such Bank, as applicable, against such loss, and if the amount of the Original Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due the Agent or such Bank in the Original Currency, the Agent or such Bank, as applicable, agrees to remit to the applicable Borrower or Borrowers such excess.
SECTION 8.11.    
Execution in Counterparts
. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. A facsimile or PDF copy of any signature hereto shall have the same effect as the original of such signature.
SECTION 8.12.

EACH BORROWER, THE AGENT, THE LOCAL CURRENCY AGENT, THE JAPAN LOCAL CURRENCY AGENT, EACH BANK, EACH LOCAL CURRENCY BANK AND EACH JAPAN LOCAL CURRENCY BANK IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, THE LOCAL CURRENCY ADDENDUM, THE JAPAN LOCAL CURRENCY ADDENDUM, OR ANY NOTE.

SECTION 8.13.    
USA Patriot Act Notification
. The following notification is provided to the Borrowers pursuant to Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act:
IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT.

Accordingly, when any Borrower opens an account, the Agent and the Banks will ask for the Borrowers name, tax identification number (if applicable), business address, and other information that will allow the Agent and the Banks to identify such
78
Borrower. The Agent and the Banks may also ask to see such Borrowers legal organizational documents or other identifying documents.
SECTION 8.14.    
Confidentiality
. Each of the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, each Bank, each Local Currency Bank and each Japan Local Currency Bank agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below) in accordance with its customary procedures, so long as such procedures provide for a reasonable standard of care (with such standard of care being at least the same standard of care as such Person would exercise to maintain the confidentiality of its own confidential information), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates respective managers, administrators, trustees, partners, directors, members, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives who are involved in the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise have a need to know (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent required, in the reasonable determination of the disclosing party, by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over it or its Affiliates (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners) including in connection with any pledge or assignment permitted under
Section 8.07(f)
, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the administration of the facility and the exercise of any remedies hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum, under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or under any other document related to or executed in connection herewith or therewith or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum or any other document related to or executed in connection herewith or therewith or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section (except that such agreement shall not contain the exceptions listed in (i) through (iv) of this clause (f)), to (i) any assignee of or participant in, or any prospective assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its managers, administrators, trustees, partners, members, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives), surety, reinsurer, guarantor or credit liquidity enhancer (or their advisors) to or in connection with any swap, derivative or other similar transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to this Agreement, the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder or payments hereunder, (iii) to any rating agency when required by it (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), or (iv) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar organization (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (g) with the consent of the Borrowers or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or any other breach of an obligation of confidentiality or (y) becomes available to the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, any Bank, any Local Currency Bank, any Japan Local Currency Bank or any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrowers.
79
For purposes of this Section, 
Information
 means all information received from the Borrowers or any of their respective Subsidiaries relating to the Borrowers or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, any Bank, any Local Currency Bank and any Japan Local Currency Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrowers or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
provided
that, in the case of information received from the Borrowers or any of their respective Subsidiaries after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care.
SECTION 8.15.    
Treatment of Information
(a) Certain of the Banks may enter into this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum and/or the Japan Local Currency Addendum and take or not take action hereunder or thereunder on the basis of information that does not contain Restricting Information. Other Banks may enter into this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum and/or the Japan Local Currency Addendum and take or not take action hereunder or thereunder on the basis of information that may contain Restricting Information. Each Bank acknowledges that United States federal and state securities laws prohibit any person from purchasing or selling securities on the basis of material, non-public information concerning an issuer of such securities or, subject to certain limited exceptions, from communicating such information to any other Person. Neither the Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall, by making any Communications (including Restricting Information) available to a Bank, by participating in any conversations or other interactions with a Bank or otherwise, make or be deemed to make any statement with regard to or otherwise warrant that any such information or Communication does or does not contain Restricting Information nor shall the Agent or any of its Related Parties be responsible or liable in any way for any decision a Bank may make to limit or to not limit its access to Restricting Information. In particular, none of the Agent nor any of its Related Parties (i) shall have, and the Agent, on behalf of itself and each of its Related Parties, hereby disclaims, any duty to ascertain or inquire as to whether or not a Bank has or has not limited its access to Restricting Information, such Banks policies or procedures regarding the safeguarding of material, nonpublic information or such Banks compliance with applicable laws related thereto or (ii) shall have, or incur, any liability to any Borrower or Bank or any of their respective Related Parties arising out of or relating to the Agent or any of its Related Parties providing or not providing Restricting Information to any Bank.
(b)    Each Borrower agrees that (i) all Communications it provides to the Agent intended for delivery to the Banks whether by posting to the Approved Electronic Platform or otherwise shall be clearly and conspicuously marked PUBLIC if such Communications do not contain Restricting Information which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word PUBLIC shall appear prominently on the first page thereof, (ii) by marking Communications PUBLIC, each Borrower shall be deemed to have authorized the Agent and the Banks to treat such Communications as either publicly available information or not material information (although, in this latter case, such Communications may contain sensitive business information
80
and, therefore, remain subject to the confidentiality undertakings of
Section 8.14
) with respect to such Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal and state securities laws, (iii) all Communications marked PUBLIC may be delivered to all Banks and may be made available through a portion of the Approved Electronic Platform designated Public Side Information, and (iv) the Agent shall be entitled to treat any Communications that are not marked PUBLIC as Restricting Information and may post such Communications to a portion of the Approved Electronic Platform not designated Public Side Information. Neither the Agent nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible for any statement or other designation by an Borrower regarding whether a Communication contains or does not contain material non-public information with respect to any of the Borrowers or their securities nor shall the Agent or any of its Affiliates incur any liability to any Borrower, any Bank or any other Person for any action taken by the Agent or any of its Affiliates based upon such statement or designation, including any action as a result of which Restricting Information is provided to a Bank that may decide not to take access to Restricting Information. Nothing in this
Section 8.15
shall modify or limit a Banks obligations under
Section 8.14
with regard to Communications and the maintenance of the confidentiality of or other treatment of Information.
(c)    Each Bank acknowledges that circumstances may arise that require it to refer to Communications that might contain Restricting Information. Accordingly, each Bank agrees that it will nominate at least one designee to receive Communications (including Restricting Information) on its behalf and identify such designee (including such designees contact information) on such Banks Administrative Questionnaire. Each Bank agrees to notify the Agent from time to time of such Banks designees e-mail address to which notice of the availability of Restricting Information may be sent by electronic transmission.
(d)    Each Bank acknowledges that Communications delivered hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum and under the Japan Local Currency Addendum may contain Restricting Information and that such Communications are available to all Banks generally. Each Bank that elects not to take access to Restricting Information does so voluntarily and, by such election, acknowledges and agrees that the Agent and other Banks may have access to Restricting Information that is not available to such electing Bank. None of the Agent nor any Bank with access to Restricting Information shall have any duty to disclose such Restricting Information to such electing Bank or to use such Restricting Information on behalf of such electing Bank, and shall not be liable for the failure to so disclose or use, such Restricting Information.
(e)    The provisions of the foregoing clauses of this
Section 8.15
are designed to assist the Agent, the Banks and the Borrowers, in complying with their respective contractual obligations and applicable law in circumstances where certain Banks express a desire not to receive Restricting Information notwithstanding that certain Communications hereunder, under the Local Currency Addendum or under the Japan Local Currency Addendum or other information provided to the Banks hereunder or thereunder may contain Restricting Information. Neither the Agent nor any of its Related Parties warrants or makes any other statement with respect to the adequacy of such provisions to achieve such purpose nor does the Agent or any of its Related Parties warrant or make any other statement to the effect that Borrowers or Banks adherence to such provisions will be sufficient to ensure compliance by such Borrower or Bank with its contractual obligations or its duties under applicable law in
81
respect of Restricting Information and each of the Banks and each Borrower assumes the risks associated therewith.
SECTION 8.16.    
Termination of Prior Agreement
. Citibank, as Agent under the Prior Agreement (the 
Existing Agent
), and each of the Banks party to the Prior Agreement (the 
Existing Banks
), hereby confirms, with respect to the Prior Agreement to which it is a party, that upon the Existing Agents receipt of all principal, accrued interest, fees, expenses, costs and other amounts outstanding under the Prior Agreement, and the Existing Agents distribution of such amounts to the Existing Banks under the Prior Agreement and any other parties entitled thereto, the Prior Agreement and the commitments of the Existing Banks thereunder shall be terminated, and all of the Borrowers obligations to the Existing Agent and the Existing Banks under the Prior Agreement shall be terminated (other than contingent indemnity obligations and any other obligations which by the terms of the Prior Agreement expressly survive the termination of such Prior Agreement). Each of the Borrowers hereby acknowledges and agrees to the termination of the Prior Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.16
.
SECTION 8.17.    
No Fiduciary Duty
. The Agent, each Bank and their Affiliates (collectively, solely for purposes of this paragraph, the Banks), may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Borrowers, their stockholders and/or their affiliates. The Borrowers agree that nothing in the Agreement and the related documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Bank, on the one hand, and the Borrowers, their stockholders or their affiliates, on the other. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and the related documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arms-length commercial transactions between the Banks, on the one hand, and such Borrower, on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (x) no Bank has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Borrower, its stockholders or its affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Bank has advised, is currently advising or will advise such Borrower, its stockholders or its affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to such Borrower except the obligations expressly set forth in the Agreement and the related documents and (y) each Bank is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of such Borrower, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. Each Borrower agrees that it will not claim that any Bank has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Bank, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

(i)    any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any obligation of CIF or CFC under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, by operation of law or otherwise, or the exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral security therefor;
(ii)    any modification or amendment of or supplement to this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum, the Japan Local Currency Addendum, or any Note;
(iii)    any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of CIF or CFC, including the merger of CIF or CFC, into another entity, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting CIF or its assets, or CFC or its assets, or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of CIF or CFC under this Agreement, the Local Currency Addendum or the Japan Local Currency Addendum, as applicable;
(iv)    the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which CFSC may have at any time against CIF or CFC, the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, any Bank or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions,

(vi)    any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by CIF, CFC, the Agent, the Local Currency Agent, the Japan Local Currency Agent, any Bank or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of CFSCs obligations under this
