Item 5. Other Events
     On December 5, 2002, the Board of Directors of The Chubb Corporation (Corporation) awarded special stock options to three independent directors in recognition of extraordinary contributions in connection with the Corporation's Chief Executive Officer transition process. Because the option awards were granted outside of the Corporation's Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (Director Plan), the Board of Directors also agreed to reduce the aggregate number of shares available for issuance upon exercise of options awarded under the Director Plan by 43,615, the aggregate number of shares issuable upon exercise of the three special options. As a result, after giving effect to the three special option awards, as of December 5, 2002, the number of shares remaining available for future issuance under the Director Plan is 296,385.
     The Registrant is filing a copy of each of the option agreements entered into between the Corporation and the three directors as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 hereto, which are incorporated by reference herein.
