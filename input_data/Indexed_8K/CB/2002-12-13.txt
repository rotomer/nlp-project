5.     Agreements.
 
 
 
 
     6.The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Underwritten Securities and the Option Securities, as the case may be, shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the Execution Time, the Closing Date and any settlement date pursuant to Section 3 hereof, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:
     Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriters.
 
 
 
 
     References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph 6(g) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter.
 
     If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing.
     The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Underwriters, at 450 Lexington Avenue, on the Closing Date.
     If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Salomon Smith Barney Inc. on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities.
7.     Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses.
     (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
8.     Indemnification and Contribution.
 
contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
     (b)  Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting": (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) following the table regarding underwriting discounts and commissions, (A) the first paragraph, (B) the second sentence in the second paragraph and (C) the third, fourth and fifth paragraphs, and (iii) the information relating to the number of shares held by Citigroup Inc. and the fact that substantially all of those shares are held on behalf of third parties in the second sentence of the last paragraph of the section "Underwriting", in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus.
     (c)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from
 
liability under paragraph 8(a) or 8(b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph 8(a) or 8(b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
provided
however
     (d)  In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , ,
Losses
provided
however
 
that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph 8(d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph 8(d).
     9.     If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth
Default by an Underwriter.
 
opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
provided
however
     10.     This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (a) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission on the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on the New York Stock Exchange, (b) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (c) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
Termination.
     11.     The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Agreement to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Warrant Agent and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "ACT" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Agreement and (subject to Section 7.01) conclusive in favor of the Warrant Agent and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section. 16

(e) The Company may set any date as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Units entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Agreement to be given, made or taken by Holders of Units. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of the Outstanding Corporate Units and the Outstanding Treasury Units, as the case may be, on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action with respect to the Corporate Units or the Treasury Units, as the case may be, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken prior to or on the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite number of Outstanding Units on such record date. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and be of no effect), and nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite number of Outstanding Units on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Warrant Agent in writing and to each Holder of Units in the manner set forth in Section 1.06. With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section 1.04(e), the Company may designate any date as the "EXPIRATION DATE" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the Warrant Agent in writing, and to each Holder of Units in the manner set forth in Section 1.06, prior to or on the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the Company shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date. SECTION 1.05. Notices. 17
Any notice or communication is duly given if in writing and delivered in Person or mailed by first-class mail (registered or certified, return receipt requested), telecopier (with receipt confirmed) or overnight air courier guaranteeing next day delivery, to the others' address; provided that notice shall be deemed given to the Warrant Agent only upon receipt thereof: If to the Warrant Agent: Bank One Trust Company, N.A. 153 West 51st Street New York, New York 10019 Attention: Corporate Trust Administration Fax: (212) 373-1383 If to the Company: The Chubb Corporation 15 Mountain View Road Warren, New Jersey 07061-1615 Attention: General Counsel Fax: (908) 903-3607 If to the Collateral Agent: BNY Midwest Trust Company 2 North LaSalle Street, Suite 1020 Chicago, Illinois 60602 Attention: Corporate Finance Fax: (312) 827-8542 If to the Indenture Trustee: Bank One Trust Company, N.A. 153 West 51st Street New York, New York 10019 Attention: Corporate Trust Administration Fax: (212) 373-1383 The Warrant Agent shall send to the Indenture Trustee at the telecopier number set forth above a copy of any notices in the form of Exhibits C, D, E or F it sends or receives. SECTION 1.06. Notice to Holders; Waiver. Where this Agreement provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at its address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed to any particular 18
Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Agreement provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Warrant Agent, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Warrant Agent shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder. SECTION 1.07. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents. The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof. SECTION 1.08. Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements in this Agreement by the Company and the Warrant Agent shall bind their respective successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not. SECTION 1.09. Separability Clause. In case any provision in this Agreement or in the Units shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof and thereof shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. SECTION 1.10. Benefits of Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement or in the Units, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors hereunder and, to the extent provided hereby, the Holders, any benefits or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement. The Holders from time to time shall be beneficiaries of this Agreement and shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions hereof and of the Units evidenced by their Certificates by their acceptance of delivery of such Certificates. SECTION 1.11. Governing Law. This Agreement and the Warrants represented by the Units shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. SECTION 1.12. Legal Holidays. 19
In any case where any Payment Date shall not be a Business Day (notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Warrants or the Senior Notes), Warrant Fees or other distributions shall not be paid on such date, but Warrant Fees or such other distributions shall be paid on the next succeeding Business Day, unless such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, in which case such Warrant Fees or other distributions shall be paid on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such Payment Date. In any case where the Warrant Settlement Date or any Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date shall not be a Business Day (notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Units), Warrants shall not be performed and Early Settlement and Cash Merger Early Settlement shall not be effected on such date, but Warrants shall be performed or Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement shall be effected, as applicable, on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such Warrant Settlement Date, Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as applicable. SECTION 1.13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts by the parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed and delivered, shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. SECTION 1.14. Inspection of Agreement. A copy of this Agreement shall be available at all reasonable times during normal business hours at the Corporate Trust Office for inspection by any Holder or Beneficial Owner. SECTION 1.15. Appointment of Financial Institution as Agent for the Company.

Any such appointment shall not relieve the Company in any way from its obligations hereunder. SECTION 1.16. No Waiver. No failure on the part of the Company, the Warrant Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective agents to exercise, and no course of dealing with respect to, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Company, the Collateral Agent, the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective agents of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies provided by law. 20

UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITARY FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REQUESTED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO.

The Certificates shall be issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Corporate Unit or Treasury Unit and any integral multiple thereof. SECTION 3.02. Rights and Obligations Evidenced by the Certificates. Each Corporate Units Certificate shall evidence the number of Corporate Units specified therein, with each such Corporate Unit representing (1) the ownership by the Holder thereof of a beneficial interest in a Senior Note or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, subject to the Pledge of such Senior Note or the Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, by such Holder pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, and (2) the rights and obligations of the Holder thereof and the Company under one Warrant. The Warrant Agent is hereby authorized, as attorney-in-fact for, and on behalf of, the Holder of each Corporate Unit, to pledge, pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, the Senior Note and the Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, if any, represented by such Corporate Unit, to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company, and to grant to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, a security interest in the right, title and interest of such Holder in such Senior Note and the Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, if any, to secure the obligation of the Holder under each Warrant to pay the Settlement Price of such Warrant and thereby purchase shares of Common Stock.

Prior to the purchase of shares of Common Stock under any Warrant, such Warrant shall not entitle the Holder of the Unit representing such Warrant to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock, including, without limitation, the right to vote or receive any dividends or other payments or to consent or to receive notice as a shareholder in respect of the meetings of shareholders or for the election of directors of the Company or for any other matter, or any other rights whatsoever as a shareholder of the Company. SECTION 3.03. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating. Subject to the provisions of Sections 3.13 and 3.14 hereof, upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and at any time and from time to time thereafter, the Company may deliver Certificates executed by the Company to the Warrant Agent for authentication, execution on behalf of the Holders and delivery, together with its Issuer Order for authentication of such Certificates, and the Warrant Agent in accordance with such Issuer Order shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holders and deliver such Certificates. The Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board of Directors, its Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, its Chief Executive Officer, its President, its Treasurer, its Secretary or one of its Vice Presidents. The signature of any of these officers on the Certificates may be manual or facsimile. Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Certificates. No Warrant evidenced by a Certificate shall be valid until such Certificate has been executed on behalf of the Holder by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the Warrant Agent, as such Holder's attorney-in-fact. Such signature by an authorized officer of the Warrant Agent shall be conclusive evidence that the Holder of such Certificate has entered into the Warrants evidenced by such Certificate. Each Certificate shall be dated the date of its authentication. 23
No Certificate shall be entitled to any benefit under this Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by an authorized officer of the Warrant Agent by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Certificate has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. SECTION 3.04. Temporary Certificates. Pending the preparation of definitive Certificates, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Warrant Agent, and the Warrant Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holders, and deliver, in lieu of such definitive Certificates, temporary Certificates which are in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A or Exhibit B hereto, as the case may be, with such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements printed, lithographed or engraved thereon as may be required by the rules of any securities exchange on which the Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, are listed, or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers of the Company executing such Certificates, as evidenced by their execution of the Certificates. If temporary Certificates are issued, the Company will cause definitive Certificates to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Certificates, the temporary Certificates shall be exchangeable for definitive Certificates upon surrender of the temporary Certificates at the Corporate Trust Office, at the expense of the Company and without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Certificates, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Warrant Agent, and the Warrant Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver in exchange therefor, one or more definitive Certificates of like tenor and denominations and evidencing a like number of Units as the temporary Certificate or Certificates so surrendered. Until so exchanged, the temporary Certificates shall in all respects evidence the same benefits and the same obligations with respect to the Units evidenced thereby as definitive Certificates. SECTION 3.05. Registration; Registration of Transfer and Exchange. The Warrant Agent shall keep at the Corporate Trust Office a register (the "SECURITY REGISTER") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Warrant Agent shall provide for the registration of Certificates and of transfers of Certificates (the Warrant Agent, in such capacity, the "SECURITY REGISTRAR"). The Security Registrar shall record separately the registration and transfer of the Certificates evidencing Corporate Units and Treasury Units. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Certificate at the Corporate Trust Office, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Warrant Agent, and the Warrant Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the designated transferee or transferees, and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Certificates of any authorized 24
denominations, like tenor, and evidencing a like number of Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be. At the option of the Holder, Certificates may be exchanged for other Certificates, of any authorized denominations and evidencing a like number of Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, upon surrender of the Certificates to be exchanged at the Corporate Trust Office. Whenever any Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Warrant Agent, and the Warrant Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver the Certificates which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Certificates issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate shall evidence the ownership of the same number of Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, and be entitled to the same benefits and subject to the same obligations under this Agreement as the Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, evidenced by the Certificate surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. Every Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Warrant Agent) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Warrant Agent duly executed, by the Holder thereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate, but the Company and the Warrant Agent may require payment from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than any exchanges pursuant to Sections 3.04, 3.06 and 8.05 not involving any transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to execute and deliver to the Warrant Agent, and the Warrant Agent shall not be obligated to authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder and deliver any Certificate in exchange for any other Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange on or after the Business Day immediately preceding the earliest to occur of any Early Settlement Date with respect to such Certificate, any Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such Certificate, the Warrant Settlement Date or the Termination Date. In lieu of delivery of a new Certificate, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Warrant Agent shall: (i) if the Warrant Settlement Date (including upon any Cash Settlement) or an Early Settlement Date or a Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such other Certificate has occurred, deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of the Warrants represented by the Units evidenced by such other Certificate; or 25
(ii) if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Warrant Settlement Date, transfer the Senior Notes, the Treasury Securities, or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, evidenced thereby, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3.15 and Article Five hereof. SECTION 3.06. Book-Entry Interests. The Certificates, on original issuance, will be issued in the form of one or more fully registered Global Certificates, to be delivered to the Depositary or its custodian by, or on behalf of, the Company. The Company hereby designates DTC as the initial Depositary. Such Global Certificates shall initially be registered on the books and records of the Company in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of the Depositary, and no Beneficial Owner will receive a definitive Certificate representing such Beneficial Owner's interest in such Global Certificate, except as provided in Section 3.09. The Warrant Agent shall enter into an agreement with the Depositary if so requested by the Company. Unless and until definitive, fully registered Certificates have been issued to Beneficial Owners pursuant to Section 3.09: (i) the provisions of this Section 3.06 shall be in full force and effect; (ii) the Company and the Warrant Agent shall be entitled to deal with the Depositary for all purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, making payments of Warrant Fees and receiving approvals, votes or consents hereunder) as the Holder of the Units and the sole holder of the Global Certificates and shall have no obligation to the Beneficial Owners; (iii) to the extent that the provisions of this Section 3.06 conflict with any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 3.06 shall control; and (iv) the rights of the Beneficial Owners shall be exercised only through the Depositary and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Beneficial Owners and the Depositary or the Depositary Participants. Transfers of securities evidenced by Global Certificates shall be made through the facilities of the Depositary, and any cancellation of, or increase or decrease in the number of, such securities (including the creation of Treasury Units and the recreation of Corporate Units pursuant to Sections 3.13 and 3.14 respectively) shall be accomplished by making appropriate annotations on the Schedule of Increases and Decreases for such Global Certificate. SECTION 3.07. Notices to Holders. Whenever a notice or other communication to the Holders is required to be given under this Agreement, the Company or the Company's agent shall give such notices and communications to the Holders and, with respect to any Units registered in the name of the 26
Depositary or the nominee of the Depositary, the Company or the Company's agent shall, except as set forth herein, have no obligations to the Beneficial Owners. SECTION 3.08. Appointment of Successor Depositary. If the Depositary elects to discontinue its services as securities depositary with respect to the Units, the Company may, in its sole discretion, appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Units. SECTION 3.09. Definitive Certificates. If: (i) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue its services as securities depositary with respect to the Units and no successor Depositary has been appointed pursuant to Section 3.08 within 90 days after such notice; or (ii) the Depositary ceases to be a "clearing agency" registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as the Depositary and so notifies the Company, and no successor Depositary has been appointed pursuant to Section 3.08 within 90 days after such notice; or (iii) the Company determines in its discretion that the Global Certificates shall be exchangeable for definitive Certificates, then (x) definitive Certificates evidencing the Units shall be prepared by the Company and delivered to the Warrant Agent and (y) upon surrender of the Global Certificates evidencing the Units by the Depositary, accompanied by registration instructions, the Company shall cause definitive Certificates to be delivered to Beneficial Owners in accordance with the instructions of the Depositary. The Company and the Warrant Agent shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on and shall be authorized and protected in relying on, such instructions. Each definitive Certificate so delivered shall evidence Units of the same kind and tenor as the Global Certificate so surrendered in respect thereof. SECTION 3.10. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Certificates. If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Warrant Agent, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Warrant Agent, and the Warrant Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Certificate, evidencing the same number of Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, and bearing a Certificate number not contemporaneously outstanding. If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Warrant Agent (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate, and (ii) such security or indemnity 27
as may be required by them to hold each of them and any agent of any of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Warrant Agent that such Certificate has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Warrant Agent, and the Warrant Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate, evidencing the same number of Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, and bearing a Certificate number not contemporaneously outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to execute and deliver to the Warrant Agent, and the Warrant Agent shall not be obligated to authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, a Certificate on or after the Business Day immediately preceding the earliest of any Early Settlement Date with respect to such lost or mutilated Certificate, any Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such lost or mutilated Certificate, the Warrant Settlement Date or the Termination Date. In lieu of delivery of a new Certificate, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Warrant Agent shall: (i) if the Warrant Settlement Date or Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Certificate has occurred, deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of the Warrants represented by the Units evidenced by such Certificate; or (ii) if a Cash Settlement with respect to such lost or mutilated Certificate or if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Warrant Settlement Date, transfer the Senior Notes, the Treasury Securities or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, evidenced thereby, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3.15 and Article Five hereof. Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section, the Company and the Warrant Agent may require the payment by the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other fees and expenses (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of the Warrant Agent) connected therewith. Every new Certificate issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company and of the Holder in respect of the Units evidenced thereby, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate (and the Units evidenced thereby) shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits and be subject to all the obligations of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Certificates delivered hereunder. 28
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude, to the extent lawful, all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates. SECTION 3.11. Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment of a Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company and the Warrant Agent, and any agent of the Company or the Warrant Agent, may treat the Person in whose name such Certificate is registered as the owner of the Units evidenced thereby for purposes of (subject to any applicable record date) any payment or distribution on the Senior Notes or on the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (ii) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio (if any), as applicable, payment of Warrant Fees and performance of the Warrants and for all other purposes whatsoever in connection with such Units, whether or not such payment, distribution, or performance shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent, nor any agent of the Company or the Warrant Agent, shall be affected by notice to the contrary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Certificate, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company, the Warrant Agent or any agent of the Company or the Warrant Agent from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary (or its nominee), as a Holder, with respect to such Global Certificate, or impair, as between such Depositary and the related Beneficial Owner, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of rights of the Depositary (or its nominee) as Holder of such Global Certificate. None of the Company, the Warrant Agent or any agent of the Company or the Warrant Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Certificate or maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. SECTION 3.12. Cancellation. All Certificates surrendered for delivery of shares of Common Stock on or after the Warrant Settlement Date or upon the transfer of Senior Notes, or for delivery of the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, after the occurrence of a Termination Event or pursuant to a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or a Cash Merger Early Settlement, or upon the registration of transfer or exchange of a Unit, or a Collateral Substitution or the recreation of Corporate Units shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Warrant Agent, be delivered to the Warrant Agent along with appropriate written instructions regarding the cancellation thereof and, if not already cancelled, shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Warrant Agent for cancellation any Certificates previously authenticated, executed and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Certificates so delivered shall, upon an Issuer Order, be promptly cancelled by the Warrant Agent. No Certificates shall be authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holder and delivered in lieu of or in exchange for any 29
Certificates cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. All cancelled Certificates held by the Warrant Agent shall be disposed of in accordance with its customary practices. If the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall acquire any Certificate, such acquisition shall not operate as a cancellation of such Certificate unless and until such Certificate is delivered to the Warrant Agent cancelled or for cancellation. SECTION 3.13. Creation of Treasury Units by Substitution of Treasury Securities. Unless the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, a Holder may, at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, effect a Collateral Substitution and separate the Senior Notes represented by such Holder's Corporate Units from the Warrants so represented by substituting, for such Senior Notes, Treasury Securities in an aggregate principal amount at maturity equal to the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Notes; provided that Holders may make such Collateral Substitutions only in integral multiples of 40 Corporate Units. To effect such substitution, the Holder must: (1) deposit with the Securities Intermediary Treasury Securities having an aggregate principal amount at maturity equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes represented by such Corporate Units; and (2) transfer the related Corporate Units to the Warrant Agent accompanied by a notice to the Warrant Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) stating that the Holder has deposited the relevant amount of Treasury Securities with the Securities Intermediary and (ii) requesting that the Warrant Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Senior Notes represented by such Corporate Units, whereupon the Warrant Agent shall promptly provide an instruction to such effect to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit A to the Pledge Agreement. Upon receipt of the Treasury Securities described in clause (1) above and the instruction described in clause (2) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will cause the Securities Intermediary to effect the release of such Senior Notes from the Pledge, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and the transfer of such Senior Notes to the Warrant Agent on behalf of the Holder. Upon receipt of such Senior Notes, the Warrant Agent shall promptly: (i) cancel the related Corporate Units; (ii) transfer the Senior Notes to the Holder (such Senior Notes shall be tradeable as a separate security, independent of the resulting Treasury Units); and 30
(iii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver Treasury Units in book-entry form or, if applicable, in the form of a Treasury Units Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.03, representing the same number of Warrants as were represented by the cancelled Corporate Units. Holders who elect to separate the Senior Notes from the related Warrants and to substitute Treasury Securities for such Senior Notes shall be responsible for any fees or expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses payable to the Collateral Agent for its services as Collateral Agent) in respect of the substitution, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be responsible for any such fees or expenses. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, a Holder may, at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, substitute Treasury Securities for the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio represented by such Corporate Units, but only in integral multiples of 4,000 Corporate Units. In such an event, the Holder shall transfer Treasury Securities to the Securities Intermediary, and the Warrant Agent shall instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledge of and transfer to the Holder the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio in the manner set forth above. In the event a Holder making a Collateral Substitution pursuant to this Section 3.13 fails to effect a book-entry transfer of the Corporate Units or fails to deliver Corporate Units Certificates to the Warrant Agent after depositing Treasury Securities with the Securities Intermediary, any distributions on the Senior Notes or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio represented by such Corporate Units shall be held in the name of the Warrant Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until such Corporate Units are so transferred or the Corporate Units Certificate is so delivered, as the case may be, or, such Holder provides evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Warrant Agent that such Corporate Units Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Warrant Agent and the Company. Except as described in Section 5.02 or in this Section 3.13 or in connection with a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or a Termination Event, for so long as the Warrant represented by a Corporate Unit remains in effect, such Corporate Units shall not be separable into the Warrants and Senior Notes or Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, represented thereby, and the rights and obligations of the Holder in respect of the Senior Notes or Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and the Warrant represented by such Corporate Units may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Corporate Unit. SECTION 3.14. Recreation of Corporate Units. 31
Unless the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, a Holder of Treasury Units may recreate Corporate Units at any time on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date; provided that Holders of Treasury Units may only recreate Corporate Units in integral multiples of 40 Treasury Units. To recreate Corporate Units, the Holder must: (1) transfer to the Securities Intermediary Senior Notes having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount at stated maturity of the Treasury Securities represented by the Treasury Units; and (2) transfer the related Treasury Units to the Warrant Agent accompanied by a notice to the Warrant Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i) stating that the Holder has transferred the relevant amount of Senior Notes to the Securities Intermediary and (ii) requesting that the Warrant Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Treasury Securities represented by such Treasury Units, whereupon the Warrant Agent shall promptly provide an instruction to such effect to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit C to the Pledge Agreement. Upon receipt of the Senior Notes described in clause (1) above and the instruction described in clause (2) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will cause the Securities Intermediary to effect the release of the Treasury Securities having a corresponding aggregate principal amount at maturity from the Pledge, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and the transfer thereof to the Warrant Agent on behalf of the Holder. Upon receipt of such Treasury Securities, the Warrant Agent shall promptly: (i) cancel the related Treasury Units; (ii) transfer the Treasury Securities to the Holder; and (iii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver Corporate Units in book-entry form or, if applicable, in the form of a Corporate Units Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.03, representing the same number of Warrants as were represented by the cancelled Treasury Units. Holders who elect to recreate Corporate Units shall be responsible for any fees or expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses payable to the Collateral Agent for its services as Collateral Agent) in respect of the recreation, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be responsible for any such fees or expenses. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, a Holder may at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date substitute the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury 32
Portfolio for Treasury Securities, but only in multiples of 4,000 Treasury Units. In such an event, the Holder shall transfer the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio to the Collateral Agent, and the Warrant Agent shall instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledge of and transfer to the Holder Treasury Securities in the manner set forth above. Except as provided in Section 5.02 or in this Section 3.14 or in connection with a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or a Termination Event, for so long as the Warrant represented by a Treasury Unit remains in effect, such Treasury Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Treasury Unit in respect of the 1/40 of a Treasury Security and the Warrant represented by such Treasury Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Treasury Unit. SECTION 3.15. Transfer of Collateral upon Occurrence of Termination Event. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event and the transfer to the Warrant Agent of the Senior Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, represented by the Corporate Units or the Treasury Units, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Warrant Agent shall request transfer instructions with respect to such Senior Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, from each Holder by written request, substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, mailed to such Holder at its address as it appears in the Security Register. Upon book-entry transfer of the Corporate Units or the Treasury Units or delivery of a Corporate Units Certificate or Treasury Units Certificate to the Warrant Agent with such transfer instructions, the Warrant Agent shall transfer the Senior Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, represented by such Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, to such Holder by book-entry transfer, or other appropriate procedures, in accordance with such instructions. In the event a Holder of Corporate Units or Treasury Units fails to effect such transfer or delivery, the Senior Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, represented by such Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, and any distributions thereon, shall be held in the name of the Warrant Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until the earlier to occur of: (i) the transfer of such Corporate Units or Treasury Units or surrender of the Corporate Units Certificate or Treasury Units Certificate or the receipt by the Company and the Warrant Agent from such Holder of satisfactory evidence that such Corporate Units Certificate or Treasury Units Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Warrant Agent and the Company; and (ii) the expiration of the time period specified in the abandoned property laws of the relevant State in which the Warrant Agent holds such property. 33
SECTION 3.16. No Consent to Assumption. Each Holder of a Unit, by acceptance thereof, shall be deemed expressly to have withheld any consent to the assumption under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, of the Warrant by the Company or its trustee, receiver, liquidator or a person or entity performing similar functions in the event that the Company becomes the debtor under the Bankruptcy Code or subject to other similar state or Federal law providing for reorganization or liquidation. ARTICLE 4 THE SENIOR NOTES AND APPLICABLE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE TREASURY PORTFOLIO SECTION 4.01. Interest Payments; Rights to Interest Payments Preserved. Any payment on any Senior Note or on the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (ii) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, which is paid on any Payment Date shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Warrant Agent from the Collateral Agent as provided by the terms of the Pledge Agreement, be paid to the Person in whose name the Corporate Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Corporate Units Certificates) representing such Senior Note or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Each Corporate Units Certificate evidencing Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Corporate Units Certificate shall carry the right to accrued and unpaid interest or distributions, and to accrue interest or distributions, which were carried by the Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio represented by such other Corporate Units Certificate. In the case of any Corporate Unit with respect to which (A) Cash Settlement of the Warrant represented by such Corporate Unit is properly effected pursuant to Section 5.02 hereof, (B) Early Settlement of the Warrant represented by such Corporate Unit is properly effected pursuant to Section 5.07 hereof, (C) Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Warrant represented by such Corporate Unit is properly effected pursuant to Section 5.04(b)(2) hereof, (D) a Collateral Substitution is properly effected pursuant to Section 3.13, or (E) a Successful Initial Remarketing occurs with respect to the Senior Note that is represented by such Corporate Unit, in each case on a date that is after any Record Date and prior to or on the next succeeding Payment Date, interest on the Senior Notes or distributions on the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, represented by such Corporate Unit otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Cash Settlement, Early Settlement, Cash Merger Early Settlement, Collateral Substitution or Initial 34
Remarketing, and such payment or distributions shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Warrant Agent, be payable to the Person in whose name the Corporate Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Corporate Units Certificates) was registered at the close of business on the Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, in the case of any Corporate Units with respect to which Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Warrant represented by such Corporate Unit is properly effected, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution has been effected, payments on the related Senior Notes or distributions on the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, that would otherwise be payable or made after the Warrant Settlement Date, Early Settlement Date, Cash Merger Early Settlement Date or the date of the Collateral Substitution, as the case may be, shall not be payable hereunder to the Holder of such Corporate Units; provided, however, that to the extent that such Holder continues to hold Separate Senior Notes or Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio that were formerly represented by such Holder's Corporate Units, such Holder shall be entitled to receive interest on such Separate Senior Notes or distributions on the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio. SECTION 4.02. Notice and Voting. Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Warrant Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Senior Notes, but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders as described below. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Senior Notes are entitled to vote or upon any solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Senior Notes, the Warrant Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail, first class, postage pre-paid, to the Holders of Corporate Units a notice: (i) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation; (ii) stating that each Holder on the record date set by the Warrant Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Senior Notes, as the case may be, entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Warrant Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to such Senior Notes represented by their Corporate Units; and (iii) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Holders of Corporate Units on such record date received by the Warrant Agent at least six days prior to such meeting, the Warrant Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of Senior Notes, as the case may be, as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Corporate Unit, the Warrant Agent shall abstain from voting the Senior Notes represented by 35
such Corporate Unit. The Company hereby agrees, if applicable, to solicit Holders of Corporate Units to timely instruct the Warrant Agent in order to enable the Warrant Agent to vote such Senior Notes. The Holders of Corporate Units and Treasury Units shall have no voting or other rights in respect of Common Stock. SECTION 4.03. Special Event Redemption. (a) If the Company elects to redeem the Senior Notes on any Payment Date following the occurrence of a Special Event as permitted by the Indenture, it shall notify the Collateral Agent in writing that a Special Event has occurred and that it intends to redeem the Senior Notes and the Special Event Redemption Date. On the Special Event Redemption Date, the Collateral Agent shall surrender the Pledged Senior Notes to the Indenture Trustee against delivery of an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Price for such Pledged Senior Notes. Thereafter, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to apply an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Amount of such funds to purchase on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units the Treasury Portfolio and promptly remit the remaining portion of such funds to the Warrant Agent for payment to the Holders of such Corporate Units. (b) Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption, (i) the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio will be substituted as Collateral for the Pledged Senior Notes and will be held by the Securities Intermediary in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement to secure the obligation of each Holder of a Corporate Unit to pay the Settlement Price of the related Warrant and thereby purchase Common Stock of the Company thereunder, (ii) the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interest rights and obligations with respect to such Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) as the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Senior Notes, as the case may be, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement, and (iii) any reference herein to the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Corporate Units Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio for Senior Notes as Collateral. (c) The Holders of Separate Senior Notes shall directly receive the redemption price for the Separate Senior Notes. ARTICLE 5 THE WARRANTS 36
SECTION 5.01. Purchase of Shares of Common Stock. (a) Each Warrant shall have an exercise price of $0.00 and shall be subject to automatic exercise on the Warrant Settlement Date, unless a Termination Event shall occur on or prior to such date. The premium payable by the Holder in consideration for the issuance of the Warrant shall be $25.00. Such amount shall not be payable on the issue date of such Warrant but shall be deferred and payable as the settlement price of the Warrant (the "SETTLEMENT PRICE") on the earlier of the Warrant Settlement Date and any Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, unless a Termination Event shall occur on or prior to any such date. Accordingly, each Warrant shall obligate the Holder of the related Units to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Warrant Settlement Date at a price equal to the Settlement Price, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock (subject to Section 5.09) equal to the Settlement Rate unless an Early Settlement, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or a Termination Event with respect to such Warrant shall have occurred. The "SETTLEMENT RATE" is equal to: (i) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is greater than $69.10 (the "THRESHOLD APPRECIATION PRICE"), 0.3618 shares of Common Stock per Warrant; (ii) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value is less than or equal to the Threshold Appreciation Price but greater than or equal to $56.64 (the "REFERENCE PRICE"), the number of shares of Common Stock per Warrant having a value equal to the Stated Amount divided by the Adjusted Applicable Market Value; (iii) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value is less than the Reference Price, 0.4414 shares of Common Stock per Warrant; in each case subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.04 (and in each case rounded upward or downward to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share). The "APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, subject to adjustments set forth under Section 5.04 hereof. The "ADJUSTED APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means (i) prior to any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a), the Applicable Market Value, and (ii) at the time of and after any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a), the Applicable Market Value multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) and the denominator shall be the Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that if such adjustment to the Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), 37
(5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Settlement Rate. The "CLOSING PRICE" per share of Common Stock on any date of determination means: (i) the closing sale price as of the close of the principal trading session (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) per share on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") on such date; (ii) if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, the closing sale price (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) per share as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States national or regional securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed; (iii) if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, the last reported sale price per share as reported by The Nasdaq National Market, Inc.; (iv) if the Common Stock is not so reported by the Nasdaq National Market, Inc., the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization; or (v) if the bid price referred to in clause (iv) is not available, the market value of Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for purposes of determining the Closing Price. A "TRADING DAY" means a day on which the Common Stock (1) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (2) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock. (b) Each Holder of a Corporate Unit or a Treasury Unit, by its acceptance of such Unit: (i) irrevocably authorizes the Warrant Agent to enter into and perform the Warrant represented thereby on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact (including, without limitation, the execution of Certificates on behalf of such Holder); (ii) agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof; 38
(iii) covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Warrant for so long as such Holder remains a Holder of a Corporate Unit or a Treasury Unit representing such Warrant; (iv) consents to the provisions hereof; (v) irrevocably authorizes the Warrant Agent to enter into and perform this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement on its behalf and in its name as its attorney-in-fact; (vi) consents to, and agrees to be bound by, the Pledge of such Holder's right, title and interest in and to the Collateral Account, including the Senior Notes and the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio or the Treasury Securities pursuant to the Pledge Agreement; and (vii) for United States federal, state and local income and franchise tax purposes, agrees to (i) treat an acquisition of the Corporate Units as an acquisition of the Senior Note and Warrant represented by each Corporate Unit, (ii) treat the Senior Notes as indebtedness of the Company and (iii) treat itself as the owner of the applicable interest in the Collateral Account, including the Senior Notes and the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) or the Treasury Securities, provided that upon a Termination Event, the rights of the Holder of such Units under the Warrant may be enforced without regard to any other rights or obligations. (c) Each Holder of a Corporate Unit or a Treasury Unit, by its acceptance thereof, further covenants and agrees that to the extent and in the manner provided in Section 5.02 and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, the Treasury Securities, the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio or a portion of the Proceeds of the Holder's exercise of the Put Right equal to the Settlement Price, as applicable, on the Warrant Settlement Date, shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Warrant and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such portion of the Proceeds. (d) Upon registration of transfer of a Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee) by the terms of this Agreement, the Warrants represented by such Certificate and the Pledge Agreement and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under this Agreement, the Warrants represented by the Certificate so transferred and the Pledge Agreement. The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Certificate, by its acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. SECTION 5.02. Remarketing; Payment of Settlement Price. 39
(a) (i) Unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the Initial Remarketing Date, the Company shall engage the Remarketing Agent pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement for Remarketing the Senior Notes. By 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Initial Remarketing Date, the Warrant Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes, and the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed pursuant to clause (ii) below. Concurrently, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, will present for Remarketing the Pledged Senior Notes, and the Custodial Agent, pursuant to clause (ii) below, will present for Remarketing the Separate Senior Notes, to the Remarketing Agent. Upon receipt of such notice from the Warrant Agent and Custodial Agent and the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) from the Collateral Agent and Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Initial Remarketing Date, use its reasonable efforts to remarket (based on the Reset Rate) (the "INITIAL REMARKETING") such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes on such date at a price of approximately (but not less than) 100.50% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes at a price not less than 100.50% of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price (a "SUCCESSFUL INITIAL REMARKETING"), the portion of the proceeds from such Successful Initial Remarketing equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price will be applied to purchase the Treasury Portfolio. The Remarketing Agent shall deduct as a remarketing fee (the "REMARKETING FEE") an amount not execeeding 25 basis points (0.25%) of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. None of the Company, the Warrant Agent, or any Holders of Corporate Units or holders of Separate Senior Notes whose Senior Notes or Separate Senior Notes, as applicable, are so remarketed will otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. With respect to Separate Senior Notes, the proceeds of a Successful Initial Remarketing in excess of the Remarketing Fee attributable to the Separate Senior Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of Separate Senior Notes. With respect to Pledged Senior Notes, the proceeds of a Successful Initial Remarketing in excess of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Remarketing Fee with respect to such Pledged Senior Notes will be remitted to the Warrant Agent for payment to the Holders of the related Corporate Units. The Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Pledged Senior Notes and the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio will be pledged to the Collateral Agent to secure the obligation of the Holders of Corporate Units to pay the Settlement Price for the Common Stock under the related Warrants on the Warrant Settlement Date. Following the occurrence of a Successful Initial Remarketing, the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations 40
with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio as the Holder of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Senior Notes, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement, and any reference herein or in the Certificates to the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio and any reference herein or in the Certificates to interest on the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Corporate Units Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio for Senior Notes. If, in spite of using its reasonable efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) in the Initial Remarketing (other than to the Company) at a price not less than 100.50% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price or a condition precedent set forth in the Remarketing Agreement is not fulfilled, the Initial Remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "FAILED INITIAL REMARKETING"). Upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) subject to such Remarketing to the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be. (ii) Prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, but no earlier than the Payment Date immediately preceding such date, Holders of Separate Senior Notes may elect to have their Separate Senior Notes remarketed under the Remarketing Agreement by delivering their Separate Senior Notes, along with a notice of such election, substantially in the form of Exhibit F to the Pledge Agreement, to the Custodial Agent. After such time, such election shall become an election to have such Separate Senior Notes remarketed in such Remarketing and, if such Remarketing fails, in any subsequent Remarketing. The Custodial Agent shall hold Separate Senior Notes in an account separate from the Collateral Account in which the Pledged Senior Notes shall be held. Holders of Separate Senior Notes electing to have their Separate Senior Notes remarketed will also have the right to withdraw that election by written notice to the Custodial Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit G to the Pledge Agreement, on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, upon which notice the Custodial Agent shall return such Separate Senior Notes to such Holder. By 11:00 a.m. on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of the Separate Senior Notes to be remarketed and will deliver to the Remarketing Agent for remarketing all such Separate Senior Notes delivered to the Custodial Agent pursuant to Section 5.07(c) of the Pledge Agreement and not validly withdrawn prior to such date. 41
(iii) Not later than seven calendar days nor more than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable Remarketing Date, the Company shall request the Depositary or its nominee to notify the Beneficial Owners or Depositary Participants holding Units of the procedures to be followed in such Remarketing. (iv) The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, if required by applicable law, a registration statement with regard to the full amount of the Senior Notes to be remarketed in the Initial Remarketing, the Second Remarketing, the Third Remarketing or the Final Remarketing, as the case may be, shall be effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a form that will enable the Remarketing Agent to use it in connection with such Remarketing. (v) The Company shall cause a notice of a Failed Remarketing to be published (with a copy of such notice to be provided to the Warrant Agent) on the Business Day immediately following the applicable Remarketing Date, in a daily newspaper in the English language of general circulation in the City of New York. (b) (i) Unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the Second Remarketing Date, if a Failed Initial Remarketing occurs, the Remarketing Agent will use its reasonable efforts to remarket the Senior Notes (a "SECOND REMARKETING") on the Second Remarketing Date. By 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Second Remarketing Date for such Second Remarketing, the Warrant Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes, and the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii). Concurrently, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, and the Custodial Agent, pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii), will present for Remarketing the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed to the Remarketing Agent. Upon receipt of such notice from the Warrant Agent and the Custodial Agent and Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) from the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Second Remarketing Date, use its reasonable efforts to remarket (based on the Reset Rate) such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes on such date at a price of approximately (but not less than) 100.50% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes at a price not less than 100.50% of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price (a "SUCCESSFUL SECOND REMARKETING"), the portion of the proceeds from such Successful Second Remarketing equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price will be applied to purchase the Treasury Portfolio. The Remarketing Agent shall deduct the Remarketing Fee from any amount of such proceeds in excess of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. None of the 42
Company, the Warrant Agent or any Holders of Corporate Units or holders of Separate Senior Notes whose Senior Notes or Separate Senior Notes are so remarketed will otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. With respect to Separate Senior Notes, the proceeds of the Second Remarketing in excess of the Remarketing Fee attributable to the Separate Senior Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of Separate Senior Notes. With respect to Pledged Senior Notes, the proceeds of the Second Remarketing in excess of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Remarketing Fee with respect to such Pledged Senior Notes will be remitted to the Warrant Agent for payment to the Holders of the related Corporate Units. The Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Pledged Senior Notes and the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio will be pledged to the Collateral Agent to secure the obligation of the Holders of Corporate Units to pay the Settlement Price for the Common Stock under the related Warrants on the Warrant Settlement Date. Following the occurrence of a Successful Second Remarketing, the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio as the Holder of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the related Senior Notes, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement, and any reference herein or in the Certificates to the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio and any reference herein or in the Certificates to interest on the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Corporate Units Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio for Senior Notes. If, in spite of using its reasonable efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) in a Second Remarketing (other than to the Company) at a price not less than 100.50% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price or a condition precedent set forth in the Remarketing Agreement is not fulfilled, the Second Remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "FAILED SECOND REMARKETING"). Upon a Failed Second Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) subject to such Remarketing to the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be. (ii) Unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the Third Remarketing Date, if a Failed Second Remarketing occurs, the Remarketing Agent will use its reasonable efforts to remarket the Senior Notes (a "THIRD REMARKETING") on the 43
Third Remarketing Date. By 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Third Remarketing Date for such Third Remarketing, the Warrant Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes, and the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii). Concurrently, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, and the Custodial Agent, pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii), will present for Remarketing the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed to the Remarketing Agent. Upon receipt of such notice from the Warrant Agent and the Custodial Agent and such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes from the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Third Remarketing Date, use its reasonable efforts to remarket (based on the Reset Rate) such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes on such date at a price of approximately (but not less than) 100.50% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes at a price not less than 100.50% of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price (a "SUCCESSFUL THIRD REMARKETING"), the portion of the proceeds from such Successful Third Remarketing equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price will be applied to purchase the Treasury Portfolio. The Remarketing Agent shall deduct the Remarketing Fee from any amount of such proceeds in excess of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. None of the Company, the Warrant Agreement or any Holders of Corporate Units or holders of Separate Senior Notes whose Senior Notes or Separate Senior Notes are so remarketed will otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. With respect to Separate Senior Notes, the proceeds of the Third Remarketing in excess of the Remarketing Fee attributable to the Separate Senior Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of Separate Senior Notes. With respect to Pledged Senior Notes, the proceeds of the Third Remarketing in excess of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Remarketing Fee with respect to such Pledged Senior Notes will be remitted to the Warrant Agent for payment to the Holders of the related Corporate Units. The Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Pledged Senior Notes and the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio will be pledged to the Collateral Agent to secure the obligation of the Holders of Corporate Units to pay the Settlement Price for the Common Stock under the related Warrants on the Warrant Settlement Date. Following the occurrence of a Successful Third Remarketing, the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests (with respect to the Collateral Agent), rights and obligations with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio as the Holder of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Senior 44
Notes, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement, and any reference herein or in the Certificates to the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio and any reference herein or in the Certificates to interest on the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Corporate Units Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio for Senior Notes. If, in spite of using its reasonable efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) in a Third Remarketing (other than to the Company) at a price not less than 100.50% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price or a condition precedent set forth in the Remarketing Agreement is not fulfilled, the Third Remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "FAILED THIRD REMARKETING"). Upon a Failed Third Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) subject to such Remarketing to the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be. (c) (i) Unless a Special Event Redemption, an Early Settlement or a Cash Merger Early Settlement has occurred prior to the Final Remarketing Date, if no Successful Remarketing has occurred prior to the Final Remarketing Date, each Holder shall have the right to satisfy such Holder's obligations under the Warrant on the Warrant Settlement Date in cash by notifying the Warrant Agent by use of a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit E hereto of its intention to pay in cash ("CASH SETTLEMENT") prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date. Promptly following 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, the Warrant Agent shall notify the Collateral Agent and the Indenture Trustee of the receipt of such notices from Holders intending to make a Cash Settlement. (ii) A Holder of a Corporate Unit who has so notified the Warrant Agent of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement shall pay the Settlement Price to the Securities Intermediary for deposit in the Collateral Account prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashiers' check or wire transfer, in each case in immediately available funds payable to or upon the order of the Securities Intermediary. Any cash so received shall be invested promptly by the Securities Intermediary in Permitted Investments and paid to the Company on the Warrant Settlement Date in settlement of the Warrants in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Any funds received by the Securities Intermediary in respect of the investment earnings from such Permitted Investments in excess of the 45
Settlement Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased by such Holder shall be distributed to the Warrant Agent when received for payment to the Holder. (iii) If a Holder of a Corporate Unit does not notify the Warrant Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement in accordance with paragraph 5.02(c)(i) above, or does notify the Warrant Agent in accordance with paragraph 5.02(c)(i) above but fails to make such payment as required by paragraph 5.02(c)(ii) above, such Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition of the Pledged Senior Notes pursuant to the Final Remarketing as described in paragraph 5.02(d) below. (iv) Promptly after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent, based on cash payments received by the Securities Intermediary pursuant to Section 5.02(c)(ii) hereof, shall promptly notify the Warrant Agent and the Indenture Trustee of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes to be tendered for purchase in the Final Remarketing in a notice pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement. (d) (i) Unless a Special Event Redemption, an Early Settlement or a Cash Merger Early Settlement has occurred prior to the Final Remarketing Date, if a Failed Third Remarketing has occurred, the Senior Notes of such Holders of Corporate Units who have not notified the Warrant Agent of their intention to effect a Cash Settlement as provided in paragraph 5.02(c)(i) above, or who have so notified the Warrant Agent in accordance with paragraph 5.02(c)(i) above but have failed to make such payment as required by paragraph 5.02(c)(ii) above, and the Separate Senior Notes of any holder who has elected for its Separate Senior Notes to be remarketed pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii) will be sold by the Remarketing Agent (the "FINAL REMARKETING") on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date (the "FINAL REMARKETING DATE"). In order to facilitate the Final Remarketing, the Warrant Agent, based on the notices specified in Section 5.02(c)(iv), and the Collateral Agent, based on the notices specified in Section 5.02(a)(ii), shall notify the Remarketing Agent, by 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Final Remarketing Date, of the aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes or aggregate principal amount of Separate Senior Notes that are to be remarketed pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii), as the case may be, to be remarketed. Concurrently, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, and the Custodial Agent shall cause such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes to be presented to the Remarketing Agent for Remarketing. (ii) Upon receipt of such notice from the Warrant Agent and the Collateral Agent and the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) from the Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent, as set forth in clause (i) above, the Remarketing Agent shall, on the Final Remarketing Date, use its reasonable efforts to remarket (based on the Reset Rate) such Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes on such date at a price equal to approximately 100.50% (or, if the Remarketing Agent is unable to 46
remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes at such price, at a price below 100.50%, but in no event less than 100%, net of the Final Remarketing Fee) of the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes being remarketed, as provided in the Remarketing Agreement. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket the Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes at a price equal to or greater than 100% (net of the Final Remarketing Fee) of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) (a "SUCCESSFUL FINAL REMARKETING"), the Remarketing Agent will remit the proceeds attributable to the Remarketing of the Pledged Senior Notes from such Successful Final Remarketing to the Securities Intermediary. The Remarketing Agent shall deduct as the remarketing fee (the "FINAL REMARKETING FEE") an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (0.25%) of the aggregate principal amount of the remarketed Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any); provided that such fee shall be payable out of, and only to the extent of, remarketing proceeds, if any, in excess of such amount. With respect to Separate Senior Notes, any proceeds of the Final Remarketing in excess of the Final Remarketing Fee attributable to the Separate Senior Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of Separate Senior Notes. The proceeds from the Remarketing remitted to the Securities Intermediary shall be invested by the Collateral Agent in Permitted Investments, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement, and then applied to satisfy in full the obligations of such Holders of Corporate Units to pay the Settlement Price for the shares of Common Stock under the related Warrants on the Warrant Settlement Date. Any proceeds in excess of those required to pay the Settlement Price and the Final Remarketing Fee will be remitted to the Warrant Agent for payment to the Holders of the related Corporate Units. (iii) If, in spite of using its reasonable efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) at a price not less than 100% (net of the Final Remarketing Fee) of the aggregate principal amount of the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes to be remarketed in the Final Remarketing (other than to the Company) or a condition precedent set forth in the Remarketing Agreement is not fulfilled, the remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "FAILED FINAL REMARKETING"). Upon a Failed Final Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return the remarketed Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) to the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be. As of the Warrant Settlement Date, each Holder of any Pledged Senior Notes that are subject to a Failed Final Remarketing, and any Senior Notes that are represented by a Corporate Unit with respect to which the Holder has notified the Warrant Agent of his intent to effect Cash Settlement and failed to deliver the Settlement Price pursuant to Section 5.02(c)(ii) shall be deemed to have exercised such Holder's Put Right with respect to such Senior Notes and to have elected to pay the Settlement Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Warrants from a portion of the Proceeds of the Put Right equal to the Settlement Price in full satisfaction of such Holders' obligations under the Warrants. (e) Intentionally Omitted. 47
(f) (i) Unless a Holder of a Treasury Unit or a Corporate Unit (if the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by such Corporate AUnit) effects an Early Settlement of the Warrant represented by such Unit through the early delivery of cash to the Warrant Agent in the manner described in Section 5.07 or a Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Warrant represented by such Unit through the early delivery of cash to the Warrant Agent in the manner described in Section 5.04(b)(2), each Holder of a Treasury Unit or a Corporate Unit who intends to effect Cash Settlement of the Warrant represented by such Unit shall so notify the Warrant Agent by use of a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit E hereto prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date. Prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the next succeeding Business Day, the Warrant Agent shall notify the Collateral Agent of the receipt of such notices from such Holders intending to make a Cash Settlement. Holders of Treasury Units may make Cash Settlements only in integral multiples of 40 Corporate Units. (ii) A Holder of a Treasury Unit or a Corporate Unit (if the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Note represented by such Corporate Unit) who has so notified the Warrant Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement in accordance with paragraph 5.02(f)(i) above shall pay the Settlement Price to the Securities Intermediary for deposit in the Collateral Account prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashiers' check or wire transfer, in each case in immediately available funds payable to or upon the order of the Securities Intermediary. Any cash received by the Securities Intermediary shall be invested promptly by the Collateral Agent in Permitted Investments and paid to the Company on the Warrant Settlement Date in settlement of the Warrant in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Any funds received by the Securities Intermediary in respect of the investment earnings from the investment in such Permitted Investments in excess of the Settlement Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased by such Holder shall be distributed to the Warrant Agent when received for payment to the Holder. (iii) If a Holder of a Treasury Unit or a Corporate Unit (if the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Note represented by such Corporate Unit) fails to notify the Warrant Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement in accordance with Section 5.02(f)(i), or does notify the Warrant Agent as provided in Section 5.02(f)(i) of its intention to pay the Settlement Price in cash, but fails to make such payment as required by Section 5.02(f)(ii), then upon the maturity of the Pledged Treasury Securities or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio held by the Securities Intermediary on or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, the principal amount of the Treasury Securities or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio received by the Collateral Agent shall be invested promptly in Permitted Investments. On the Warrant 48
Settlement Date, an amount equal to the Settlement Price shall be remitted to the Company as payment of such Holder's obligation to pay such Settlement Price under the related Warrants without receiving any instructions from the Holder. In the event the sum of the Proceeds from related Pledged Treasury Securities or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio and the Proceeds from such Permitted Investments is in excess of the aggregate Settlement Price, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to distribute such excess to the Warrant Agent for the benefit of the Holder of the related Treasury Units or Corporate Units when received. (g) Any distribution to Holders of any payments described above shall be payable at the office of the Warrant Agent in New York City maintained for that purpose or, at the option of the Holder, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the Security Register. (h) Upon Cash Settlement of any Warrant: (i) the Collateral Agent will in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement cause the Pledged Senior Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio or the Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, represented by the relevant Units to be released from the Pledge, free and clear of any security interest of the Company, and transferred to the Warrant Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof or its designee as soon as practicable; and (ii) subject to the receipt thereof, the Warrant Agent shall, by book-entry transfer or other appropriate procedures, in accordance with written instructions provided by the Holder thereof, transfer such Senior Notes, or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio or such Treasury Securities, as the case may be (or, if no such instructions are given to the Warrant Agent by the Holder, the Warrant Agent shall hold such Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio or such Treasury Securities, as the case may be, and any interest payment thereon, in the name of the Warrant Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder until the expiration of the time period specified in the abandoned property laws of the relevant state where such property is held). (i) The obligations of the Holders to pay the Settlement Price are non-recourse obligations and, except to the extent satisfied by Early Settlement, Cash Merger Early Settlement or Cash Settlement, are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders, and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between the proceeds of the disposition of Collateral and the Settlement Price. 49
(j) The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Warrant or deliver any certificates thereof to the Holder of the related Units unless the Company shall have received payment of the Settlement Price for the Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner herein set forth. SECTION 5.03. Issuance of Shares of Common Stock. Unless a Termination Event, an Early Settlement or a Cash Merger Early Settlement shall have occurred, subject to Section 5.04(b), on the Warrant Settlement Date upon receipt of the aggregate Settlement Price payable on all Outstanding Units, the Company shall issue and deposit with the Warrant Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of the Outstanding Units, one or more certificates representing newly issued shares of Common Stock registered in the name of the Warrant Agent (or its nominee) as custodian for the Holders (such certificates for shares of Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions for which a record date and payment date for such dividend or distribution has occurred after the Warrant Settlement Date, being hereinafter referred to as the "WARRANT SETTLEMENT FUND") to which the Holders are entitled hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, upon surrender of a Certificate to the Warrant Agent on or after the Warrant Settlement Date, Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be, together with settlement instructions thereon duly completed and executed, the Holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive forthwith in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of newly issued whole shares of Common Stock which such Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article Five (after taking into account all Units then held by such Holder), together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 5.09 and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares constituting part of the Warrant Settlement Fund, but without any interest thereon, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Such shares shall be registered in the name of the Holder or the Holder's designee as specified in the settlement instructions provided by the Holder to the Warrant Agent. If any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of a Warrant are to be registered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Warrant is registered (but excluding any Depositary or nominee thereof), no such registration shall be made unless the Person requesting such registration has paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such registration in a name other than that of the registered Holder of the Certificate evidencing such Warrant or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax either has been paid or is not payable. SECTION 5.04. Adjustment of Settlement Rate. (a) Adjustments for Dividends, Distributions, Stock Splits, Etc. (1) In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock in Common Stock, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by dividing such Settlement Rate by a fraction of which: 50
(i) the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination; and (ii) the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this paragraph (1), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company agrees that it shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. (2) In case the Company shall issue rights, warrants or options, other than pursuant to any dividend reinvestment plans or share purchase plans, to all holders of its Common Stock (not being available on an equivalent basis to Holders of the Units upon settlement of the Warrants represented by such Units) entitling them, for a period expiring within 45 days after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date of announcement of such issuance, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the date of such announcement shall be increased by dividing such Settlement Rate by a fraction of which: (i) the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of such announcement plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such Current Market Price; and (ii) the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of such announcement plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Business Day following the date of such announcement. The Company agrees that it shall notify the Warrant Agent if any issuance of such rights, warrants or options is cancelled or not completed following the announcement thereof and the Settlement Rate shall thereupon be readjusted to the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the date of such announcement. For the purposes of this paragraph (2), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company agrees that it shall not issue any such rights, warrants or options in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. 51
(3) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the day preceding the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the day preceding the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective. (4) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including shares of capital stock, securities, cash and property but excluding any rights, warrants or options referred to in paragraph (2) of this Section 5.04(a), any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash and any dividend or distribution referred to in paragraph (1) of this Section 5.04(a)), the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution shall be adjusted by dividing such rate by a fraction of which: (i) the numerator shall be the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination less the then fair market value (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be described in a Board Resolution) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock; and (ii) the denominator shall be such Current Market Price per share of Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this paragraph (4) is applicable, paragraph (2) of this Section 5.04(a) shall not be applicable. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Settlement Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Settlement Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (5) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock cash (excluding any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.04(b) applies, as part of a distribution referred to in paragraph (4) of this Section or as a regular quarterly cash distribution) in an aggregate amount that, combined together with (I) the aggregate amount of any other distributions (other than regular quarterly cash distributions) to all holders of its Common Stock made exclusively in cash within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution (the "TRAILING 12 MONTH PERIOD") and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (5) or paragraph (6) of this Section has been made and (II) the aggregate amount of any cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the Board of 52
Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of consideration (other than consideration payable in respect of any odd-lot tender offer) payable in respect of any tender or exchange offer by the Company or any of its subsidiaries and calculated as of the expiration of such tender or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock concluded within the Trailing 12 Month Period and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (5) or paragraph (6) of this Section has been made, exceeds 10% of the product of the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date for the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date, then, in such case, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on such record date shall be adjusted by dividing such rate by a fraction of which: (i) the numerator shall be the Current Market Price of Common Stock on such record date less the amount of cash so distributed (and not excluded as provided above) applicable to one share of Common Stock; and (ii) the denominator shall be the Current Market Price of Common Stock, such increase to be effective at the opening of business on the day following the record date; provided, however, that in the event the portion of cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each holder of a Unit shall have the right to receive upon settlement of the Units the amount of cash such Holder would have received had such Holder settled each Unit on the record date. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Settlement Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Settlement Rate which would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (6) If the Company or any subsidiary of the Company shall make a tender or exchange offer (other than any odd-lot tender offer) for all or any portion of the Common Stock and upon expiration of such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) the Company or its subsidiary shall be required to pay to shareholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of Purchased Shares (as herein defined) any consideration, then if the sum of (I) the fair market value of the aggregate consideration to be paid in such tender offer or exchange offer (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be described in a Board Resolution) plus (II) the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be described in a Board Resolution), as of the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, of consideration payable in respect of any other tender or exchange offer (other than consideration payable in respect of any odd-lot tender offer), by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of Common Stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender or exchange offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (6) has been made, plus (III) the aggregate amount of any 53
distributions (other than regular quarterly cash distributions) to all holders of Common Stock made exclusively in cash within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender or exchange offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to paragraph (5) has been made, exceeds 10% of the product of the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock as of the last time (the "EXPIRATION TIME") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended) times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the Expiration Time, then, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the day of the Expiration Time shall be adjusted by dividing by a fraction: (i) the numerator of which shall be equal to (A) the product of (I) the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date of the Expiration Time and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) on the date of the Expiration Time less (B) the amount of cash plus the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to shareholders based on the transactions described in clauses (I), (II) and (III) above (assuming in the case of clause (I) the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares); and (ii) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (A) the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock as of the Expiration Time and (B) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) as of the Expiration Time less the number of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "PURCHASED SHARES"), such adjustment to become effective at the opening of business on the date following the date of the Expiration Time. (7) The reclassification of Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.04(b) applies) shall be deemed to involve: (i) a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution" and the "date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of paragraph (4) of this Section); and (ii) a subdivision, split or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective", 54
as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of paragraph (3) of this Section). (8) The "CURRENT MARKET PRICE" per share of Common Stock on any date of determination means the average of the daily Closing Prices on each of the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days ending on the earlier of such date of determination and the day before the "ex date" with respect to the issuance or distribution requiring the computation. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "ex date," when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, shall mean the first date on which Common Stock trades regular way on such exchange or in such market without the right to receive such issuance or distribution. (9) All adjustments to the Settlement Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment in the Settlement Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent thereof; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. (10) The Company may, but shall not be required to, make such increases in the Settlement Rate, in addition to those required by this Section, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reason. (11) The Company has entered into a Rights Agreement dated as of March 12, 1999 (the "RIGHTS AGREEMENT") with First Chicago Trust Company of New York pursuant to which share purchase rights (the "RIGHTS") have been, and may in the future be, issued in respect of shares of Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock issued upon settlement of any Warrant pursuant to this Article 5 shall be entitled to receive the appropriate number of Rights, if any, and the certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such settlement shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as provided by and subject to the terms of the Rights Agreement as in effect at the time of such settlement. If after the date of this Agreement the Rights separate from the Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the Rights Agreement so that a Holder would not be entitled to receive any Rights in respect of the Common Stock issuable upon settlement of such Warrant, the Settlement Rate will be adjusted as provided in this Section 5.04 on the separation date, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of the Rights. In lieu of any such adjustment, the Company may amend the Rights Agreement to provide that upon settlement Holders will receive, in addition to the Common Stock issuable upon such settlement, the Rights that would have attached to such shares of Common Stock if the Rights had not become separated from the Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of the Rights Agreement. If the Company hereafter adopts any stockholder rights plan similar to the Rights Agreement, a Holder shall be entitled to receive upon settlement of its 55
Warrants in addition to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement the related rights for the Common Stock whether or not the rights under the future stockholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock at the time of settlement but otherwise subject to the generally applicable terms of such plan and no additional adjustment to the Settlement Rate shall be made for the future stockholder rights plan under this Section 5.04. (b) Adjustment for Consolidation, Merger or Other Reorganization Event. (1) In the event of: (i) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation are not exchanged for cash, securities or other property of the Company or another corporation); (ii) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of the property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety; (iii) any statutory share exchange of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition); or (iv) any liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Company other than as a result of or after the occurrence of a Termination Event (any event described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), a "REORGANIZATION EVENT"), each Warrant shall become, without the consent of the Holder of the Unit representing such Warrant, an agreement to purchase only the kind of securities, cash and other property receivable upon consummation of such Reorganization Event by a holder of Common Stock immediately prior to the closing date of such Reorganization Event. The amount of such securities, cash and other property receivable upon settlement of each such Warrant after the consummation of the Reorganization Event shall be based on the value as of such settlement date of the hypothetical amount of securities, cash and other property that would have been received upon consummation of the Reorganization Event in exchange for the maximum number of Common Stock deliverable under a Warrant immediately prior to the closing date of the Reorganization Event (collectively, the "EXCHANGE PROPERTY"). In determining the kind and amount of the Exchange Property pursuant to the foregoing, it will be assumed that such holder of Common Stock is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a "CONSTITUENT PERSON"), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-affiliates and such Holder failed to exercise its rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, 56
cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("NON-ELECTING SHARE"), then for the purpose of this Section the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event by each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). The actual amount of Exchange Property receivable upon settlement of each Warrant shall be (1) in the case of settlement on the Warrant Settlement Date or pursuant to Section 5.04(b)(2), a variable amount based upon the applicable Settlement Rate and the Adjusted Applicable Market Value of the Exchange Property at such time and (2) in the case of any Early Settlement, determined in accordance with the procedures described under Section 5.07 using the Settlement Rate that results in the minimum amount of Exchange Property being delivered under such Warrant. For purposes of this Section 5.04(b)(1) and Section 5.04(b)(2), the term "Adjusted Applicable Market Value" shall be deemed to refer to the "Adjusted Applicable Market Value" of the Exchange Property, and such value shall be determined (A) with respect to any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the Closing Price of such securities, (B) in the case of any cash that comprises all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the amount of such cash and (C) in the case of any other property that comprises all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the value of such property, as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for this purpose; provided that prior to the separation of the Rights or any similar stockholder rights from the Common Stock, such Rights or similar stockholder rights shall be deemed to have no value. The term "Closing Price" shall be deemed to refer to the closing sale price, last quoted bid price or mid-point of the last bid and ask prices, as the case may be, of any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property. The term "Trading Day" shall be deemed to refer to any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property. In the event of such a Reorganization Event, the Person formed by such consolidation, merger or exchange or the Person which acquires the assets of the Company or, in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Company, the Company or a liquidating trust created in connection therewith, shall execute and deliver to the Warrant Agent an agreement supplemental hereto providing that each Holder of an Outstanding Unit shall have the rights provided by this Section 5.04(b). Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such supplemental agreement, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 5.04. The above provisions of this Section 5.04 shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events. (2) In the event of a consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person or any merger of another Person into the Company (other than a merger that does not 57
result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of Common Stock), in each case in which 30% or more of the total consideration paid to the Company's shareholders consists of cash or cash equivalents (a "CASH MERGER"), a Holder of a Unit may settle ("CASH MERGER EARLY SETTLEMENT") the Warrant represented by such Unit, upon the conditions set forth below, at the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the closing of the Cash Merger; provided that (i) the Cash Merger Early Settlement Date (as defined below) is no later than the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date and (ii) no Cash Merger Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(2) unless, at the time such Cash Merger Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Cash Merger Early Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) have in effect a Registration Statement covering any securities to be delivered in respect of the Warrants being settled and (B) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Cash Merger Early Settlement. If a Holder effects a Cash Merger Early Settlement of some or all of its Warrants, such Holder shall be entitled to receive, on the Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, the aggregate amount of any Deferred Warrant Fees and any Accrued and Unpaid Warrant Fees since the immediately preceding Payment Date with respect to such Warrants. The Company shall pay such amount as a credit against the amount otherwise payable by the Holders to effect such Cash Merger Early Settlement. Within five Business Days of the completion of a Cash Merger, the Company shall provide written notice to Holders of Units of such completion of a Cash Merger, which shall specify the deadline for submitting the notice to settle early in cash pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(2), the date on which such Cash Merger Early Settlement shall occur (which date shall be 10 days after the date of such written notice by the Company, but which shall in no event be later than the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date) (the "CASH MERGER EARLY SETTLEMENT DATE"), the applicable Settlement Rate and the amount (per share of Common Stock) of cash, securities and other consideration receivable by the Holder upon settlement, including the amount of Warrant Fees receivable upon settlement. Corporate Units Holders and Treasury Units Holders may only effect Cash Merger Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(2) in integral multiples of 40 Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, Corporate Units Holders may only effect Cash Merger Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(2) in multiples of 4,000 Corporate Units. Other than the provisions relating to timing of notice and settlement, which shall be as set forth above, the provisions of Section 5.01(a) shall apply with respect to a Cash Merger Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(2). In order to exercise the right to effect Cash Merger Early Settlement with respect to any Warrants, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing Units shall deliver, no later than 5:00 p.m. 58
(New York City time) on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, such Certificate to the Warrant Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount equal to the product of (A) the Stated Amount times (B) the number of Warrants with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Cash Merger Early Settlement, less the amount of any Warrant Fees payable to the Holder on the Cash Merger Early Settlement Date. If a Holder properly effects an effective Cash Merger Early Settlement in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.04(b)(2), the Company will deliver (or will cause the Collateral Agent to deliver) to the Holder on the Cash Merger Early Settlement Date: (i) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Cash Merger by a Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on account of each Warrant if the Warrant Settlement Date had occurred immediately prior to such Cash Merger (based on the Settlement Rate in effect at such time), assuming such Holder of Common Stock is not a Constituent Person or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Cash Merger provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-affiliates and such Holder failed to exercise its rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Cash Merger (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Cash Merger is not the same for each non- electing share, then for the purpose of this Section 5.04(b)(2), the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Cash Merger by each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of determining the Adjusted Applicable Market Value (in connection with determining the appropriate Settlement Rate to be applied in the foregoing sentence), the date of the closing of the Cash Merger shall be deemed to be the Warrant Settlement Date; (ii) the Senior Notes, the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, related to the Warrants with respect to which the Holder is effecting a Cash Merger Early Settlement; and (iii) if so required under the Securities Act, a Prospectus as contemplated by this Section 5.04(b)(2). (c) All calculations and determinations pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall be made by the Company or its agent and the Warrant Agent shall have no responsibility with respect thereto. (d) The Corporate Units or the Treasury Units of the Holders who do not elect Cash Merger Early Settlement in accordance with the foregoing will continue to remain outstanding and be subject to settlement on the Warrant Settlement Date in accordance with the terms hereof. 59
SECTION 5.05. Notice of Adjustments and Certain Other Events. (a) Whenever the Settlement Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall within 10 Business Days following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.04 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware): (i) compute the adjusted Settlement Rate in accordance with Section 5.04 and prepare and transmit to the Warrant Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Settlement Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and (ii) provide a written notice to the Holders of the Units of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to the Settlement Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted Settlement Rate. (b) The Warrant Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Units to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Settlement Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Warrant Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying on any Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.05(a)(i) and any adjustment contained therein and the Warrant Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it has received such certificate. The Warrant Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Warrant; and the Warrant Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Warrant Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Warrant or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article. SECTION 5.06. Termination Event; Notice. The Warrants and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Warrant Fees (including any accrued and unpaid Warrant Fees and any Deferred Warrant Fees), if the Company shall have such obligation, and the rights and obligations of Holders to purchase Common Stock, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Warrant Agent or the Company, if, prior to or on the Warrant Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. 60
Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Units shall thereafter represent solely the right to receive the Senior Notes, the Treasury Securities or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, represented by such Units, in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.04 of the Pledge Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Warrant Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. SECTION 5.07. Early Settlement. (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.07, at the option of the Holder thereof, Warrants represented by Units may be settled early ("EARLY SETTLEMENT") at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date; provided that no Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.07 unless, at the time such Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Early Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) have in effect a Registration Statement covering any securities to be delivered in respect of the Warrants being settled and (B) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Early Settlement. (b) In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Warrants, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing Units shall deliver, at any time prior to 5:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, such Certificate to the Warrant Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT AMOUNT") equal to: (i) the sum of (A) the product of (I) the Settlement Price, times (II) the number of Warrants with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (B) if such delivery is made with respect to any Warrants during the period from the close of business on any Record Date next preceding any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Warrant Fees payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Warrants, less (ii) the amount of any Deferred Warrant Fees payable to such Holder as a result of such Early Settlement. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, no payment shall be made upon Early Settlement of any Warrant on account of any Warrant Fees accrued on such Warrant since the immediately preceding Payment Date or on account of any dividends on the Common Stock issued upon such Early Settlement. However, a Holder effecting an Early Settlement of 61
some or all of its Warrants shall be entitled to receive, on the date it receives the shares of Common Stock referred to in Section 5.07(d), the amount of any Deferred Warrant Fees with respect to such Warrants, calculated as of the immediately preceding Payment Date. The amount of such Deferred Warrant Fees shall be credited against the amount otherwise payable by the Holder to effect such Early Settlement as set forth in clause (ii) above. If the foregoing requirements are first satisfied with respect to Warrants represented by any Units at or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on a Business Day, such day shall be the "EARLY SETTLEMENT DATE" with respect to such Units and if such requirements are first satisfied after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on a Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day, the "EARLY SETTLEMENT DATE" with respect to such Units shall be the next succeeding Business Day. Upon the receipt of such Certificate and Early Settlement Amount from the Holder, the Warrant Agent shall pay to the Company such Early Settlement Amount, the receipt of which payment the Company shall confirm in writing. The Warrant Agent shall then, in accordance with Section 5.06 of the Pledge Agreement, notify the Collateral Agent that (A) such Holder has elected to effect an Early Settlement, which notice shall set forth the number of such Warrants as to which such Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, (B) the Warrant Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Early Settlement Amount and (C) all conditions to such Early Settlement have been satisfied. Holders of Treasury Units may only effect Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.07 in integral multiples of 40 Treasury Units. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, Corporate Units Holders may only effect Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.07 in integral multiples of 4,000 Corporate Units. Upon Early Settlement of the Warrants, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any accrued and unpaid Warrant Fees since the immediately preceding Payment Date and any future Warrant Fees with respect to such Warrants shall immediately and automatically terminate. (c) Upon Early Settlement of Warrants by a Holder of the related Units, the Company shall issue, and the Holder shall be entitled to receive, 0.3618 shares of Common Stock on account of each Warrant as to which Early Settlement is effected (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT RATE"). The Early Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rate is adjusted pursuant to Section 5.04. (d) No later than the third Business Day after the applicable Early Settlement Date, the Company shall cause: (i) the shares of Common Stock issuable upon Early Settlement of Warrants to be issued and delivered, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.09; and 62
(ii) the related Senior Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable, in the case of Corporate Units, or the related Treasury Securities, in the case of Treasury Units, to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent and transferred, in each case, to the Warrant Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof or its designee. (e) Upon Early Settlement of any Warrants, and subject to receipt of shares of Common Stock from the Company and the Senior Notes, the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, from the Securities Intermediary, as applicable, the Warrant Agent shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof on the applicable form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse of the Certificate evidencing the related Units: (i) transfer to the Holder the Senior Notes, the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, represented by such Units, (ii) deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates for the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Early Settlement, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.09, and (iii) if so required under the Securities Act, deliver a Prospectus for the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Early Settlement as contemplated by Section 5.07(a). (f) In the event that Early Settlement is effected with respect to Warrants represented by less than all the Units evidenced by a Certificate, upon such Early Settlement the Company shall execute and the Warrant Agent shall execute on behalf of the Holder, authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a Certificate evidencing the Units as to which Early Settlement was not effected. (g) A Holder of a Unit who effects Early Settlement may elect to have the Senior Notes no longer represented by a Corporate Unit remarketed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.02. SECTION 5.08. Intentionally Omitted. SECTION 5.09. No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered upon settlement on the Warrant Settlement Date, or upon Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement of any Warrants. If Certificates evidencing more than one Warrant shall be surrendered for settlement at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock which shall be delivered upon settlement shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Warrants evidenced by the Certificates so surrendered. Instead 63
of any fractional share of Common Stock which would otherwise be deliverable upon settlement of any Warrants on the Warrant Settlement Date, or upon Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Company, through the Warrant Agent, shall make a cash payment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to the percentage of such fractional share times the Applicable Market Value calculated as if the date of such settlement were the Warrant Settlement Date. The Company shall provide the Warrant Agent from time to time with sufficient funds to permit the Warrant Agent to make all cash payments required by this Section 5.09 in a timely manner. SECTION 5.10. Charges and Taxes. The Company will pay all stock transfer and similar taxes attributable to the initial issuance and delivery of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Warrants; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any such tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any exchange of or substitution for a Certificate evidencing a Unit or any issuance of a share of Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered Holder of a Certificate surrendered in respect of the Units evidenced thereby, other than in the name of the Warrant Agent, as custodian for such Holder, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such share certificates or Certificates unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the transfer or issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. SECTION 5.11. Warrant Fees. (a) Subject to Section 5.11(d) and Section 5.12, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Warrant Fees payable in respect of each Warrant to the Person in whose name a Certificate is registered at the close of business on the Record Date relating to such Payment Date. The Warrant Fees will be payable at the office of the Warrant Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City maintained for that purpose. If the book-entry system for the Units has been terminated, the Warrant Fees will be payable, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Security Register, or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person by a prior written notice to the Warrant Agent. If any date on which Warrant Fees are to be made is not a Business Day, then payment of the Warrant Fees payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest in respect of any such delay); provided that if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, then payment of the Warrant Fees will be made on the Business Day immediately preceding such Business Day. Warrant Fees payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Warrant Fees will accrue from December 2, 2002. (b) Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company's obligation to pay future Warrant Fees (including any accrued Warrant Fees and any Deferred Warrant Fees) shall cease. 64
(c) Each Certificate delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of (including as a result of a Collateral Substitution or the recreation of Corporate Units) any other Certificate shall carry the right to accrued and unpaid Warrant Fees and Deferred Warrant Fees, which right was carried by the Warrants represented by such other Certificates. (d) In the case of any Unit with respect to which Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Warrant represented by such Unit is effected on a date that is after any Record Date and prior to or on the next succeeding Payment Date, Warrant Fees otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, and such Warrant Fees shall be paid to the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Unit is registered at the close of business on such Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any Unit with respect to which Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Warrant represented by such Unit is effected, Warrant Fees that would otherwise be payable after the Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such Warrant shall not be payable. (e) The Company's obligations with respect to Warrant Fees, if any, will be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations under any Indebtedness. (f) In the event (x) of any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors upon any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings, or (y) subject to the provisions of Section 5.11(h) below, that (i) a default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the payment of principal, interest or any other monetary amounts due and payable on any Indebtedness and such default shall have continued beyond the period of grace, if any, specified in the instrument evidencing such Indebtedness (and the Warrant Agent shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or one or more holders of Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any such Indebtedness may have been issued), or (ii) the maturity of any Indebtedness shall have been accelerated because of a default in respect of such Indebtedness (and the Warrant Agent shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or one or more holders of Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any such Indebtedness may have been issued), then: (i) the holders of all Indebtedness shall first be entitled to receive, in the case of clause (x) above, payment of all amounts due or to become due upon all Indebtedness and, in the case of subclauses (i) and (ii) of clause (y) above, payment of all amounts due thereon, or provision shall be made for such payment in money or money's worth, before the Holders of any of the Units are entitled to receive any Warrant Fees on the Warrants represented by the Units; 65
(ii) any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the Holders of any of the Units would be entitled except for the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (q), shall be paid or delivered by the Person making such payment or distribution, whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver or liquidating trustee or otherwise, directly to the representative or representatives of the holders of Indebtedness or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any of such Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably according to the aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of such Indebtedness held or represented by each, to the extent necessary to make payment in full of all Indebtedness remaining unpaid after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Indebtedness, before any payment or distribution is made of such Warrant Fees to the Holders of such Units; and (iii) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, shall be received by the Warrant Agent or the Holders of any of the Units when such payment or distribution is prohibited pursuant to Section 5.11(e) through (q), such payment or distribution shall be paid over to the representative or representatives of the holders of Indebtedness or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any such Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably as aforesaid, for application to the payment of all Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all such Indebtedness shall have been paid in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Indebtedness. (g) For purposes of Section 5.11(e) through (q), the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other Person provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in Section 5.11(e) through (q) with respect to such Warrant Fees on the Units to the payment of all Indebtedness which may at the time be outstanding; provided that (i) the indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness, as the case may be, that constitutes Indebtedness is assumed by the Person, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) the rights of the holders of the Indebtedness are not, without the consent of each such holder adversely affected thereby, altered by such reorganization or readjustment; (h) Any failure by the Company to make any payment on or perform any other obligation under Indebtedness, other than any indebtedness incurred by the Company or assumed or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by the Company for money borrowed (or any deferral, renewal, extension or refunding thereof) or any indebtedness or obligation as to which the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (g) shall have been waived by the Company in the instrument or instruments by which the Company incurred, assumed, guaranteed or otherwise created such indebtedness or obligation, shall not be deemed a default or event of default if (i) the Company shall be disputing its obligation to make such payment or perform such obligation 66
and (ii) either (A) no final judgment relating to such dispute shall have been issued against the Company which is in full force and effect and is not subject to further review, including a judgment that has become final by reason of the expiration of the time within which a party may seek further appeal or review, and (B) in the event a judgment that is subject to further review or appeal has been issued, the Company shall in good faith be prosecuting an appeal or other proceeding for review and a stay of execution shall have been obtained pending such appeal or review. (i) Subject to the irrevocable payment in full of all Indebtedness, the Holders of the Units shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all obligations of the Company which by their express terms are subordinated to Indebtedness of the Company to the same extent as payment of the Warrant Fees in respect of the Warrants represented by the Units is subordinated and which are entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to the Indebtedness until all such Warrant Fees owing on the Units shall be paid in full, and as between the Company, its claimholders other than holders of such Indebtedness and the Holders, no such payment or distribution made to the holders of Indebtedness by virtue of Section 5.11(e) through (q) that otherwise would have been made to the Holders shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company on account of such Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (q) are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of Indebtedness, on the other hand. (j) Nothing contained in Section 5.11(e) through (q) or elsewhere in this Agreement or in the Units is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its claimholders other than the holders of Indebtedness and the Holders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders such Warrant Fees on the Units as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders and claimholders of the Company other than the holders of Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Warrant Agent or any Holder from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Agreement, subject to the rights, if any, under Section 5.11(e) through (q), of the holders of Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy. (k) Upon payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in Section 5.11(e) through (q), the Warrant Agent and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which any such dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceeding affecting the affairs of the Company is pending or upon a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidating trustee or Warrant Agent or other person making any payment or distribution, delivered to the Warrant Agent or to the Holders, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts 67
paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to these Section 5.11(e) through (q). (l) The Warrant Agent shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Indebtedness (or a trustee or representative on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Indebtedness or a trustee or representative on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Warrant Agent determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to Section 5.11(e) through (q), the Warrant Agent may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Warrant Agent as to the amount of Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under Section 5.11(e) through (q), and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Warrant Agent may defer payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. (m) Nothing contained in Section 5.11(e) through (q) shall affect the obligations of the Company to make, or prevent the Company from making, payment of the Warrant Fees, except as otherwise provided in these Section 5.11(e) through (q). (n) Each Holder of Units, by its acceptance thereof, authorizes and directs the Warrant Agent on its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in Section 5.11 (e) through (q) and appoints the Warrant Agent its attorney-in-fact, as the case may be, for any and all such purposes. (o) The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Warrant Agent of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Warrant Agent in respect of the Units pursuant to the provisions of this Section. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (q) or any other provisions of this Agreement, the Warrant Agent shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Warrant Agent, or the taking of any other action by the Warrant Agent, unless and until the Warrant Agent shall have received written notice thereof mailed or delivered to the Warrant Agent from the Company, any Holder, or the holder or representative of any Indebtedness; provided that if at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any such moneys may become payable for any purpose, the Warrant Agent shall not have received with respect to such moneys the notice provided for in this Section, then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Warrant Agent shall have full power and authority to receive such moneys and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it within two Business Days prior to or on or after such date. (p) The Warrant Agent in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Section with respect to any Indebtedness at the time held by it, to the same extent as 68
any other holder of Indebtedness and nothing in this Agreement shall deprive the Warrant Agent of any of its rights as such holder. (q) No right of any present or future holder of any Indebtedness to enforce the subordination herein shall at any time or in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with. (r) Nothing in this Section 5.11 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Warrant Agent under or pursuant to Section 7.07. (s) With respect to the holders of Indebtedness, (i) the duties and obligations of the Warrant Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement; (ii) the Warrant Agent shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall, acting in good faith, mistakenly pay over or distribute to the Holders or to the Company or any other Person cash, property or securities to which any holders of Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Section 5.11 or otherwise; (iii) no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Warrant Agent; and (iv) the Warrant Agent shall not be deemed to be a fiduciary as to such holders. SECTION 5.12. Deferral of Warrant Fees. (a) The Company has the right to defer payment of all or part of the Warrant Fees in respect of each Warrant until no later than the Warrant Settlement Date (or, in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be), but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Warrant Agent written notice of its election to defer such payment (specifying the amount to be deferred) at least ten Business Days prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding Payment Date or (ii) the date the Company is required to give notice of the Record Date or Payment Date with respect to payment of such Warrant Fees to the NYSE or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to Holders, but in any event not less than one Business Day prior to such Record Date. If the Company so elects to defer Warrant Fees, the Company shall pay additional Warrant Fees on such deferred installments of Warrant Fees at a rate equal to 7.00% per annum, compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until such deferred installments are paid in full (such deferred installments of Warrant Fees together with the accrued additional Warrant Fees thereon, being referred to herein as the "DEFERRED WARRANT FEES"). Deferred Warrant Fees shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to this Section. (b) In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Warrant Fees on the Warrants until the Warrant Settlement Date (or, in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be), each Holder will receive on the Warrant Settlement Date, Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as applicable, the aggregate amount of Deferred 69
Warrant Fees to the extent such amounts are not deducted from the Settlement Price in the case of a Cash Settlement, any Early Settlement or any Cash Merger Early Settlement. The Company shall pay such amount on the Warrant Settlement Date (or, in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be) in the manner described in Section 5.11(a). (c) In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Warrant Fees, then, until all Deferred Warrant Fees have been paid, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to, declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock or their capital stock; provided that the Company's subsidiaries will not be restricted from declaring or paying such dividends, or making such distributions, to the Company or any of the Company's other subsidiaries as a result of the foregoing. ARTICLE 6 REMEDIES SECTION 6.01. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Warrant Fees and to Purchase Shares of Common Stock. Each Holder of a Unit shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, (i) subject to Article 5, to receive each Warrant Fee with respect to the Warrant represented by such Unit on the applicable Payment Date and (ii) except upon and following a Termination Event, to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Warrant and, in each such case, to institute suit for the enforcement of any such right to receive Warrant Fees and the right to purchase shares of Common Stock, and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder. SECTION 6.02. Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Agreement and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company and such Holder shall be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of such Holder shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted. SECTION 6.03. Rights and Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates in the last paragraph of Section 3.10, no right or remedy 70
herein conferred upon or reserved to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. SECTION 6.04. Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of any Holder to exercise any right upon a default or remedy upon a default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such right. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by such Holders. SECTION 6.05. Undertaking for Costs. All parties to this Agreement agree, and each Holder of a Unit, by its acceptance of such Unit shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Agreement, or in any suit against the Warrant Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Warrant Agent, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; provided that the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Warrant Agent, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% of the Outstanding Units, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of interest on any Senior Notes or Warrant Fees on or after the respective Payment Date therefor in respect of any Unit held by such Holder, or for enforcement of the right to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Warrants represented by any Unit held by such Holder. SECTION 6.06. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Agreement; and the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Warrant Agent or the Holders, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

SECTION 9.03. Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel Given to Warrant Agent.

SECTION 10.06. Tax Treatment.

The "ADJUSTED APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means (i) prior to any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Warrant Agreement, the Applicable Market Value, and (ii) at the time of and after any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Warrant Agreement, the Applicable Market Value multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Warrant Agreement and the denominator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that if such adjustment to the Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Warrant Agreement during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Settlement Rate. The "CLOSING PRICE" per share of Common Stock on any date of determination means: (1) the closing sale price as of the close of the principal trading session (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) per share on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") on such date; (2) if Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, the closing sale price (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) per share as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States national or regional securities exchange on which Common Stock is so listed; (3) if Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, the last reported sale price per share as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.; (4) if Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization; or A-8
(5) if such bid price is not available, the market value of Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company. A "TRADING DAY" means a day on which Common Stock (1) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (2) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of Common Stock. In accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement, the Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate may pay the Settlement Price for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Warrant evidenced hereby by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or, if applicable, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or from the proceeds of the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio or a Remarketing of the related Pledged Senior Notes. Unless the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by Corporate Units, a Holder of Corporate Units who (1) does not, on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, notify the Warrant Agent of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement, or who does so notify the Warrant Agent but fails to make an effective Cash Settlement prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, or (2) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day prior to the Warrant Settlement Date, does not make an effective Early Settlement, shall pay the Settlement Price for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered under the related Warrant from the proceeds of the sale of the related Pledged Senior Notes held by the Collateral Agent unless the Holder has previously made a Cash Merger Early Settlement. Unless the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by Corporate Unit, such sale will be made by the Remarketing Agent pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement on the Final Remarketing Date. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by Corporate Units, a Holder of Corporate Units who does not notify the Warrant Agent, on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement shall pay the Settlement Price for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered under the related Warrant from the proceeds at maturity of the Applicable Ownership Interests (as defined in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio. As provided in the Warrant Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Failed Final Remarketing, each Holder of any Pledged Senior Notes that are subject to a Failed Final Remarketing, and any Senior Notes that are represented by a Corporate Unit with respect to which the Holder has notified the Warrant Agent of his intent to effect Cash Settlement and failed to deliver the Settlement Price pursuant to Section 5.02(c)(ii) shall be deemed to have exercised such Holder's Put Right and to have elected to pay for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Warrants from a portion of the Proceeds of the Put Right equal to the Settlement Price in full satisfaction of such Holders' obligations under the Warrants. A-9
The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Warrant or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment of the aggregate Settlement Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Warrant Agreement. Each Warrant evidenced hereby and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holder thereunder shall terminate if a Termination Event shall occur. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall give written notice to the Warrant Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Pledged Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio represented by each Corporate Unit from the Pledge. A Corporate Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Senior Note or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio represented by such Corporate Units in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement and the Warrant Agreement, the Warrant Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Senior Notes, but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Senior Notes are entitled to vote or upon the solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Senior Notes, the Warrant Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the Corporate Units Holders a notice: (1) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation; (2) stating that each Corporate Units Holder on the record date set by the Warrant Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Senior Notes entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Warrant Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the Senior Notes represented by such Holder's Corporate Units; and (3) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Corporate Units Holders on such record date, received by the Warrant Agent at least six days prior to such meeting, the Warrant Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Corporate Unit, the Warrant Agent shall abstain from voting the Senior Note evidenced by such Corporate Unit. Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption, the Collateral Agent shall surrender the Pledged Senior Notes against delivery of an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Price of the Pledged Senior Notes and shall deposit funds in the Collateral Account in exchange for the A-10
Pledged Senior Notes. Thereafter, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to apply an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Amount of such funds to purchase on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units, the Treasury Portfolio and promptly (a) transfer the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio to the Collateral Account to secure the obligations of each Holder of Corporate Units to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Warrants represented by such Corporate Units, (b) transfer the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (ii) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio to the Warrant Agent for the benefit of the Holders of such Corporate Units and (C) remit the remaining portion of such funds to the Warrant Agent for payment to the Holders of such Corporate Units. Upon the occurrence of a Successful Remarketing of Senior Notes prior to the Final Remarketing Date, pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, the Remarketing Agent will apply an amount equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price to purchase on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units, the Treasury Portfolio, and, after deducting the Remarketing Fee to the extent permitted under the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, promptly remit the remaining portion of such proceeds of such Successful Remarketing to the Warrant Agent for payment to the Holders of such Corporate Units. Following the occurrence of (i) a Special Event Redemption prior to the Warrant Settlement Date, or (ii) a Successful Remarketing of the Senior Notes prior to the Final Remarketing Date, the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interest rights and obligations with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio as the Holder of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Senior Notes, as the case may be, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement and any reference herein to the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Treasury Portfolio. The Corporate Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Corporate Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Corporate Units Certificate will be registered and Corporate Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Warrant Agreement. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Warrant Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company and the Warrant Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. A Holder who elects to substitute a Treasury Security for a Senior Note, thereby creating Treasury Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Warrant Agreement, for so long as the Warrant represented by a Corporate Units remains in effect, such Corporate Units shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Corporate Units in respect of the Senior Notes and Warrant represented by such Corporate Units may be transferred and exchanged only as a Corporate Unit. A-11
Unless the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Warrant Agreement, the Holder of Corporate Units may substitute, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, for the Pledged Senior Notes securing such Holder's obligations under the related Warrants, Treasury Securities in an aggregate principal amount at maturity equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Pledged Senior Notes in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such Collateral Substitution, each Unit for which such Pledged Treasury Securities secures the Holder's obligation under the Warrant shall be referred to as a "TREASURY UNIT". A Holder may make such Collateral Substitution only in integral multiples of 40 Corporate Units for 40 Treasury Units. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, a Holder may, at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, substitute Treasury Securities for the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, but only in integral multiples of 4,000 Corporate Units. In such an event, the Holder shall transfer Treasury Securities to the Collateral Agent, and the Warrant Agent shall instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledge of and transfer to the Holder the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio. The Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Warrant Fees payable in respect of each Warrant to the Person in whose name the Corporate Units Certificate evidencing such Warrant is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Warrant Fees will be payable at the office of the Warrant Agent in New York City. If the book- entry system for the Corporate Units has been terminated, the Warrant Fees will be payable, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Security Register, or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person by a prior written notice to the Warrant Agent. The Company has the right to defer payment of all or part of the Warrant Fees in respect of each Warrant until no later than the Warrant Settlement Date (or in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be). If the Company so elects to defer Warrant Fees, the Company shall pay additional Warrant Fees on such deferred installments of Warrant Payments at a rate equal to 7.00% per annum, compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until such deferred installments are paid. In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Warrant Fees on the Warrants until the Warrant Settlement Date (or, in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be), each Holder will receive on the Warrant Settlement Date, Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as applicable, the aggregate amount of Deferred Warrant Fees to the extent such fees are not deducted from the Settlement Price in the case of a Cash Settlement or any Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement. A-12
The Warrants and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Warrant Fees, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Warrant Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Warrant Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Warrant Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, from the Pledge in accordance with the provisions of the Pledge Agreement. Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Warrant Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Warrants represented by Units may be settled early at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date ("EARLY SETTLEMENT") as provided in the Warrant Agreement. In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Warrant evidenced by this Certificate, the Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate shall deliver to the Warrant Agent at the Corporate Trust Office an Election to Settle Early form set forth below duly completed and accompanied by payment in the form of immediately available funds payable to the order of the Company in an amount (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT AMOUNT") equal to: (i) (A) the product of (I) the Stated Amount, times (B) the number of Warrants with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (B) if such delivery is made with respect to any Warrants during the period from the close of business on any Record Date next preceding any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Warrant Fees payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Warrants, less (ii) the amount of any Deferred Warrant Fees payable to such Holder as a result of such Early Settlement. Upon Early Settlement of Warrants by a Holder of the related Units, the Pledged Senior Notes or Pledge Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) represented by such Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Warrant represented by a Corporate Unit as to which Early Settlement is effected equal to 0.3618 shares of Common Stock per Warrant (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT RATE"). The Early Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rate is adjusted as provided in Section 5.04 of the Warrant Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Cash Merger, a Holder of Corporate Units may effect Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Warrant represented by such Corporate Units pursuant to the A-13
terms of Section 5.04(b)(2) of the Warrant Agreement. Upon Cash Merger Early Settlement of Warrants by a Holder of the related Corporate Units, the Pledged Senior Notes or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio represented by such Corporate Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Pledge Agreement. Upon registration of transfer of this Corporate Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Warrant Agent pursuant to the Warrant Agreement), under the terms of the Warrant Agreement and the Warrants evidenced hereby and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Warrants evidenced by this Corporate Units Certificate. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. The Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, authorizes the Warrant Agent to enter into and perform the related Warrants represented by the Corporate Units evidenced hereby on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) of the Warrants by the Company or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Warrants, consents to the provisions of the Warrant Agreement, authorizes the Warrant Agent to enter into and perform the Warrant Agreement and the Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to the Pledge of the Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, represented by this Corporate Units Certificate pursuant to the Pledge Agreement. The Holder further covenants and agrees that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Warrant Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, payments with respect to the aggregate principal amount of the Pledged Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, on the Warrant Settlement Date shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Warrant and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments. Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Warrant Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the Warrants.

Each Treasury Unit represents (i) a 1/40 undivided beneficial ownership interest of a Treasury Security having a principal amount at maturity equal to $1,000, subject to the Pledge of such Treasury Security by such Holder pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, and (ii) the rights and obligations of the Holder under one Warrant with The Chubb Corporation, a New Jersey corporation (the "COMPANY").

(REVERSE OF TREASURY UNIT CERTIFICATE) Each Warrant evidenced hereby is governed by a Warrant Agreement, dated as of December 2, 2002 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "WARRANT AGREEMENT") between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., asWarrant Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "WARRANT AGENT"), to which the Warrant Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Warrant Agent, the Company and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Treasury Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. Each Warrant evidenced hereby shall have an exercise price of $0.00 and shall be subject to automatic exercise on November 16, 2005 (the "WARRANT SETTLEMENT DATE"), unless a Termination Event shall occur on or prior to such date. The premium payable by the Holder in consideration for the issuance of the Warrant evidenced hereby shall be $25.00. Such amount shall not be payable on the issue date of such Warrant but shall be deferred and payable as the settlement price of the Warrant (the "SETTLEMENT PRICE") on the earlier of the Warrant Settlement Date and any Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, unless a Termination Event shall occur on or prior to any such date. Accordingly, each Warrant evidenced hereby shall obligate the Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Warrant Settlement Date, at a price equal to the Settlement Price, a number of newly issued shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("COMMON STOCK"), of the Company, equal to the Settlement Rate, unless on or prior to the Warrant Settlement Date there shall have occurred a Termination Event or an Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement with respect to such Warrant. The "SETTLEMENT RATE" is equal to: (1) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is greater than $69.10 (the "THRESHOLD APPRECIATION PRICE"), 0.3619 shares of Common Stock per Warrant; (2) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value is less than or equal to the Threshold Appreciation Price but greater than or equal to $56.64 (the "REFERENCE PRICE"), the number of shares of Common Stock per Warrant having a value equal to the Stated Amount divided by the Adjusted Applicable Market Value; and (3) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value is less than the Reference Price, 0.4414 shares of Common Stock per Warrant; in each case subject to adjustment as provided in the Warrant Agreement (and in each case rounded upward or downward to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share). No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Warrants, as provided in Section of the Warrant Agreement. B-6
Each Warrant evidenced hereby, which is settled through Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement shall obligate the Holder of the related Treasury Units to purchase at the Settlement Price, and the Company to sell, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Early Settlement Rate (in the case of an Early Settlement) or applicable Settlement Rate (in the case of a Cash Merger Early Settlement). The "APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means the average of the Closing Prices per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, subject to adjustments set forth under Section 5.04 hereof. The "ADJUSTED APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means (i) prior to any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Warrant Agreement, the Applicable Market Value, and (ii) at the time of and after any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Warrant Agreement, the Applicable Market Value multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Warrant Agreement and the denominator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that if such adjustment to the Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Warrant Agreement during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Settlement Rate. The "CLOSING PRICE" per share of Common Stock on any date of determination means the: (1) closing sale price as of the close of the principal trading session (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) per share on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") on such date; (2) if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, the closing sale price (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) per share as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States national or regional securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed; (3) if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, the last reported sale price per share as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.; (4) if the Common Stock is not so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization; or B-7
(5) if such bid price is not available, the market value of the Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company. A "TRADING DAY" means a day on which the Common Stock (1) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (2) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock. In accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement, the Holder of this Treasury Unit shall pay the Settlement Price for the shares of the Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Warrant evidenced hereby either by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or, if applicable, a Cash Merger Early Settlement of each such Warrant or by applying a principal amount of the Pledged Treasury Securities represented by such Holder's Treasury Unit equal to the Stated Amount of such Warrant to the purchase of the Common Stock. A Holder of Treasury Units who (1) does not on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, notify the Warrant Agent of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement, or who does so notify the Warrant Agent but fails to make an effective Cash Settlement prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, (2) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day prior to the Warrant Settlement Date, does not make an effective Early Settlement, or (3) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day prior to the Warrant Settlement Date, does not make an effective Cash Merger Early Settlement, shall pay the Settlement Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the related Warrant from the proceeds of the Pledged Treasury Securities. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Warrant or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment of the aggregate settlement price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Warrant Agreement. The Company has the right to defer payment of all or part of the Warrant Fees in respect of each Warrant until no later than the Warrant Settlement Date (or in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be). If the Company so elects to defer Warrant Fees, the Company shall pay additional Warrant Fees on such deferred installments of Warrant Payments at a rate equal to 7.00% per annum, compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until such deferred installments are paid. In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Warrant Fees on the Warrants until the Warrant Settlement Date (or, in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement, as the case may be), each Holder will receive on the Warrant Settlement Date or Early Settlement Date, as applicable, the aggregate amount of Deferred Warrant Fees to the B-8
extent such fees are not deducted from the Settlement Price in the case of a Cash Settlement or any Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement. The Warrants and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Warrant Fees, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Warrant Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Warrant Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Warrant Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Pledged Treasury Securities (as defined in the Pledge Agreement) represented by each Treasury Unit. A Treasury Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Proceeds of the Treasury Security represented by such Treasury Unit, in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. The Treasury Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Treasury Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Treasury Units Certificate will be registered and Treasury Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Warrant Agreement. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Warrant Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company and the Warrant Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. A Holder who elects to substitute Senior Notes, for Treasury Securities, thereby recreating Corporate Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses associated therewith. Except as provided in the Warrant Agreement, for so long as the Warrant represented by a Treasury Unit remains in effect, such Treasury Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Treasury Unit in respect of the Treasury Security and the Warrant represented by such Treasury Unit may be transferred and exchanged only as a Treasury Unit. Unless the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units and subject to the conditions set forth in the Warrant Agreement, a Holder of Treasury Units may recreate, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, Corporate Units by delivering to the Securities Intermediary Senior Notes with an aggregate principal amount, equal to the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Pledged Treasury Securities in exchange for the release of such Pledged Treasury Securities in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such substitution, the Holder's Units shall be referred to as a "CORPORATE UNIT". Any such creation of Corporate Units may be effected only in multiples of 40 Treasury Units for 40 Corporate Units. B-9
The Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Warrant Fees payable in respect of each Warrant to the Person in whose name the Treasury Units Certificate evidencing such Warrant is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Warrant Fees will be payable at the office of the Warrant Agent in New York City or, at the option of the Holder, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the Security Register. The Warrants and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Warrant Fees, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Warrant Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Warrant Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Warrant Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Treasury Securities from the Pledge in accordance with the provisions of the Pledge Agreement. A Treasury Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the interest in the Treasury Security represented by such Treasury Unit, in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Warrant Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Warrants represented by Units may be settled early ("EARLY SETTLEMENT") as provided in the Warrant Agreement. In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Warrant evidenced by this Certificate, the Holder of this Treasury Units Certificate shall deliver to the Warrant Agent at the Corporate Trust Office an Election to Settle Early form set forth below duly completed and accompanied by payment in the form of immediately available funds payable to the order of the Company in an amount (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT AMOUNT") equal to: (i) (A) the product of (I) the Stated Amount, times (II) the number of Warrants with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (B) if such delivery is made with respect to any Warrants during the period from the close of business on any Record Date next preceding any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Adjustment Payments payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Warrants (ii) the amount of any Deferred Warrant Fees payable to such Holder as a result of such Early Settlement. Upon Early Settlement of Warrants by a Holder of the related Units, the Pledged Treasury Securities represented by such Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Warrant represented by a Treasury Unit as to which Early Settlement is effected B-10
equal to 0.3618 shares of Common Stock per Warrant (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT RATE"). The Early Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rate is adjusted as provided in Section 5.04 of the Warrant Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Cash Merger, a Holder of Treasury Units may effect Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Warrant represented by such Treasury Units pursuant to the terms of Section 5.04(b)(2) of the Warrant Agreement. Upon Cash Merger Early Settlement of Warrants by a Holder of the related Treasury Units, the Pledged Treasury Securities represented by such Treasury Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Pledge Agreement. Upon registration of transfer of this Treasury Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Warrant Agent pursuant to the Warrant Agreement), under the terms of the Warrant Agreement and the Warrants evidenced hereby and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Warrants evidenced by this Treasury Units Certificate. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. The Holder of this Treasury Units Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, authorizes the Warrant Agent to enter into and perform the related Warrants represented by the Treasury Units evidenced hereby on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) of the Warrants by the Company or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof, covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Warrants, consents to the provisions of the Warrant Agreement, authorizes the Warrant Agent to enter into and perform the Warrant Agreement and the Pledge Agreement on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, and consents to the Pledge of the Treasury Securities represented by this Treasury Units Certificate pursuant to the Pledge Agreement. The Holder further covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Warrant Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, payments in respect to the aggregate principal amount of the Pledged Treasury Securities on the Warrant Settlement Date shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Warrant and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments. Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Warrant Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a majority of the Warrants. The Warrants shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. Prior to due presentment of this Certificate for registration or transfer, the Company, the Warrant Agent and its Affiliates and any agent of the Company or the Warrant Agent may treat the Person in whose name this Treasury Units Certificate is registered as the owner of the Treasury Units evidenced hereby for the purpose of receiving payments of interest on the B-11
Treasury Securities, receiving payments of Warrant Fees (subject to any applicable record date), performance of the Warrants and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company, the Warrant Agent nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Section 7. Indemnification.

Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or any other Remarketing Materials, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse the Remarketing Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Remarketing Agent in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use therein. (b) The Remarketing Agent will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus supplement, or any other Remarketing Materials, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to subsection (a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Remarketing Agent. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any G-11
one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 7 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. Section 8. Contribution. (a) If the indemnification provided for in Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Sections 7(a) or 7(b), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other from the offering of the Remarketed Senior Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other in connection with the statements of omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equile considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand in connection with the Remarketing shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes less the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent on the one hand and the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent on the other hand bear to the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agent on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equile if contribution pursuant to this subsection (a) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equile considerations referred to above in this subsection (a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (a) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (a), the Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the fees received by it under Section 4 exceeds the amount of any damages which the Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person G-12
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (b) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Remarketing Agent and to each person, if any, who controls the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Remarketing Agent under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Remarketing Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act. (c) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in Section 7 and this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent or any person controlling the Remarketing Agent, or the Company, its officers or director or any controlling person of the Company, and the completion of the Remarketing. Section 9. Resignation and Removal of the Remarketing Agent. The Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove the Remarketing Agent, by giving 30 days' prior written notice, in the case of a resignation, to the Company and the Depositary and, in the case of a removal, to the removed Remarketing Agent and the Depositary; provided, however, that (a) the Remarketing Agent may not resign without reasonable cause; and (b) no such resignation nor any such removal shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor Remarketing Agent and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Company, in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Transaction Documents in all material respects. In any such case, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent and enter into such a remarketing agreement with such person as soon as reasonably practicable. The provisions of Section 7 and Section 8 shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement. Section 10. Dealing in Securities. The Remarketing Agent, when acting as a Remarketing Agent or in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the G-13
Remarketed Senior Notes, Corporate Units, Treasury Units or any of the securities of the Company (together, the "SECURITIES"). The Remarketing Agent may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of such Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. Section 11. Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care. The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents.

The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties except as otherwise set forth herein. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketed Senior Notes in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from its failure to comply with the material terms of this Agreement or the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part. The provisions of this Section 11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement. Section 12. Termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate (i) as to the Remarketing Agent on the effective date of the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 9 and (ii) on the earlier of (x) any Special Event Redemption Date and (y) the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the other provisions hereof, except as otherwise provided herein, the Company shall not be under any liability to the Remarketing Agent and the Remarketing Agent shall not be under any liability to the Company, except that if this Agreement is terminated by the Remarketing Agent because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Remarketing Agent for all of its out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of its counsel) reasonably incurred by it. Section 7, Section 8 and Section 11 hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent. Section 13. Notices.

(a) Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of (1) a notice from the Warrant Agent promptly after the receipt by the Warrant Agent of a notice from a Holder of Corporate Units or Treasury Units that such Holder has elected, in accordance with the procedures specified in Section 5.02(c)(i) or (f)(i) of the Warrant Agreement, respectively, to effect a Cash Settlement and (2) payment by such Holder by deposit in the Collateral Account prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date of the Settlement Price in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashier's check or wire transfer of immediately available funds payable to or upon the order of the Securities Intermediary, then the Collateral Agent shall: (i) instruct the Securities Intermediary promptly to invest any such Cash in Permitted Investments; (ii) instruct the Securities Intermediary to release from the Pledge such Holder's related Pledged Senior Notes, Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests or Pledged Treasury Securities, as applicable, as to which such Holder has effected a Cash Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.05(a); and (iii) instruct the Securities Intermediary to Transfer all such Pledged Senior Notes, Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests or the Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, to the Warrant Agent for distribution to such Holder, in each case free and clear of the Pledge created hereby. The Company shall instruct the Collateral Agent in writing as to the type of Permitted Investments in which any such Cash shall be invested; provided, however, that if the Company fails to deliver such written instructions by 10:30 a.m. (New York City time) on the day such Cash is received by the Collateral Agent or to be reinvested by the Securities Intermediary, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to invest such Cash in the Permitted Investments described in clause (6) of the definition of Permitted Investments. In 17
no event shall the Collateral Agent or Securities Intermediary be liable for the selection of Permitted Investments or for investment losses incurred thereon. The Collateral Agent and Securities Intermediary shall have no liability in respect of losses incurred as a result of the failure of the Company to provide timely written investment direction. Upon receipt of the proceeds upon the maturity of the Permitted Investments on the Warrant Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to (A) pay the portion of such proceeds and deliver any certified or cashier's checks received, in an aggregate amount equal to the Settlement Price, to the Company on the Warrant Settlement Date, and (B) release any amounts in excess of the Settlement Price earned from such Permitted Investments to the Warrant Agent for distribution to such Holder. (b) If a Holder of Corporate Units (if the Treasury Portfolio has not replaced the Senior Notes represented by such Corporate Units) (i) fails to notify the Warrant Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement as provided in paragraph 5.02(c)(i) of the Warrant Agreement or (ii) does notify the Warrant Agent of its intention to pay the Settlement Price in cash, but fails to make such payment as required by paragraph 5.02(c)(ii) of the Warrant Agreement, such Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition of such Holder's Pledged Senior Notes in accordance with paragraph 5.02(c)(iii) of the Warrant Agreement. (c) If a Holder of a Treasury Unit or a Holder of a Corporate Unit (if the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by such Corporate Unit) (i) fails to notify the Warrant Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement as provided in paragraph 5.02(f)(i) of the Warrant Agreement or (ii) does notify the Warrant Agent as provided in paragraph 5.02(f)(ii) of the Warrant Agreement of its intention to pay the Settlement Price in cash, but fails to make such payment as required by paragraph 5.02(f)(ii) of the Warrant Agreement, such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to pay the Settlement Price in accordance with paragraph 5.02(f)(iii) of the Warrant Agreement. (d) As soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Warrant Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall deliver to the Warrant Agent a notice, substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, stating (i) the amount of Cash that it has received with respect to the Cash Settlement of Corporate Units, (ii) the amount of Cash that it has received with respect to the Cash Settlement of Treasury Units and (iii) the amount of Pledged Senior Notes to be remarketed in the Final Remarketing pursuant to Section 5.02(c)(iii) of the Warrant Agreement. 18
SECTION 5.06. Early Settlement and Cash Merger Early Settlement. Upon receipt by the Collateral Agent of a notice from the Warrant Agent that a Holder of Units has elected to effect either (i) Early Settlement of its obligations under the Warrants represented by such Units in accordance with the terms of the Warrants and Section 5.07 of the Warrant Agreement or (ii) Cash Merger Early Settlement of its obligations under the Warrants represented by such Units in accordance with the terms of the Warrants and Section 5.04(b)(2) of the Warrant Agreement (which notice shall set forth the number of such Warrants as to which such Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement), and that the Warrant Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Settlement Price pursuant to the terms of the Warrants and the Warrant Agreement and that all conditions to such Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, as the case may be, have been satisfied, then the Collateral Agent shall release from the Pledge, (1) Pledged Senior Notes or the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in the case of a Holder of Corporate Units or (2) Pledged Treasury Securities, in the case of a Holder of Treasury Units, in each case with a Value equal to the product of (x) the Stated Amount times (y) the number of Warrants as to which such Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, and shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to Transfer all such Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests or Pledged Senior Notes or Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, to the Warrant Agent for distribution to such Holder, in each case free and clear of the Pledge created hereby. A holder of Treasury Units may settle early only in integral multiples of 40 Treasury Units, and a Holder of Corporate Units, if the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by such Corporate Units, may settle early only in integral multiples of 4,000 Corporate Units. SECTION 5.07. Application of Proceeds in Settlement of Warrants. (a) If a Holder of Corporate Units (if the Treasury Portfolio has not replaced the Senior Notes represented by such Corporate Units) has not elected to make an effective Cash Settlement by notifying the Warrant Agent in the manner provided for in Section 5.02(c)(i) of the Warrant Agreement or does notify the Warrant Agent as provided in paragraph 5.02(c)(i) of the Warrant Agreement of its intention to pay the Settlement Price in cash, but fails to make such payment as required by paragraph 5.02(c)(ii) of the Warrant Agreement, such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to pay for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Warrants from the Proceeds of the Final Remarketing of the related Pledged Senior Notes. In the event of a Successful Final Remarketing, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to Transfer the related Pledged Senior Notes to the Remarketing Agent upon confirmation of deposit by the Remarketing Agent of the Proceeds of such Final Remarketing (less, to the extent permitted by 19
the Remarketing Agreement, the Remarketing Fee) in the Collateral Account. The Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to invest the Proceeds of the Final Remarketing in Permitted Investments set forth in clause (6) of the definition of Permitted Investments. On the Warrant Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall, in consultation with the Warrant Agent, instruct the Securities Intermediary to remit a portion of the Proceeds from such Final Remarketing equal to the aggregate principal amount of such Pledged Senior Notes to the Company to satisfy in full such Holder's obligations to pay the Settlement Price to purchase the shares of Common Stock under the related Warrants and to remit the balance of the Proceeds from the Final Remarketing, if any, to the Warrant Agent for distribution to such Holder. If the Remarketing Agent advises the Collateral Agent in writing that there has been a Failed Final Remarketing, each Holder of Corporate Units (if the Treasury Portfolio has not replaced the Senior Notes represented by such Corporate Units) that has not elected to make an effective Cash Settlement by notifying the Warrant Agent in the manner provided for in Section 5.02(c)(i) of the Warrant Agreement or does notify the Warrant Agent as provided in paragraph 5.02(c)(i) of the Warrant Agreement of its intention to pay the Settlement Price in cash, but fails to make such payment as required by paragraph 5.02(c)(ii) of the Warrant Agreement, shall be deemed to have exercised such Holder's Put Right with respect to such Senior Notes and to have elected to have a portion of the Proceeds of the Put Right set-off against such Holder's obligation to pay the aggregate Settlement Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Warrants in full satisfaction of such Holders' obligations under the Warrants. Following such set-off, the Holder's obligations to pay the Settlement Price for the shares of Common Stock will be deemed to be satisfied in full, and the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to release the Pledged Senior Notes from the Collateral Account and shall promptly transfer the Pledged Senior Notes to the Company. Thereafter, the Collateral Agent shall promptly remit the remaining portion the Proceeds of the Holder's exercise of the Put Right in excess of the aggregate Settlement Price for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Warrants to the Warrant Agent for payment to the Holder of the Corporate Units to which such Senior Notes relate. (b) If a Holder of a Treasury Unit or a Holder of a Corporate Unit (if the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by such Corporate Unit) has not elected to make an effective Cash Settlement by notifying the Warrant Agent in the manner provided for in Section 5.02(f)(i) of the Warrant Agreement, or has given such notice but failed to make such payment in the manner required by Section 5.02(f)(ii) of the Warrant Agreement, such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to pay for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Warrants from the Proceeds of the related Pledged Treasury 20
Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests, as the case may be. Promptly, after 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately prior to the Warrant Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to invest the Cash Proceeds of the maturing Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests, as the case may be, in Permitted Investments set forth in clause (6) of the definition of Permitted Investments, unless prior to 10:30 a.m. (New York City time) on such date, the Company shall otherwise instruct the Collateral Agent in writing as to the type of Permitted Investments in which any such Cash Proceeds shall be invested. In no event shall the Collateral Agent be liable for the selection of Permitted Investments or for investment losses incurred thereon. The Collateral Agent shall have no liability in respect of losses incurred as a result of the failure of the Company to provide timely written investment direction. Without receiving any instruction from any such Holder, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to remit the Proceeds of the related Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests, as the case may be, to the Company in settlement of such Warrants on the Warrant Settlement Date. In the event the sum of the Proceeds from the related Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests, as the case may be, and the investment earnings from the investment in Permitted Investments exceeds the aggregate Settlement Price of the Warrants being settled thereby, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to transfer such excess, when received, to the Warrant Agent for distribution to such Holder. (c) Prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, but no earlier than the Payment Date immediately preceding such date, Holders of Separate Senior Notes may elect to have their Separate Senior Notes remarketed under the Remarketing Agreement, by delivering their Separate Senior Notes along with a notice of such election, substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto, to the Custodial Agent. After such time, such election shall become an irrevocable election to have such Separate Senior Notes remarketed in such Remarketing and, if such Remarketing fails, in any subsequent Remarketing. The Custodial Agent shall hold Separate Senior Notes in an account separate from the Collateral Account in which the Pledged Securities shall be held. Holders of Separate Senior Notes electing to have their Separate Senior Notes remarketed will also have the right to withdraw that election by written notice to the Custodial Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit G hereto, prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, upon which notice the Custodial Agent shall return such Separate Senior Notes to such Holder. By 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, the Custodial Agent shall notify the 21
Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of the Separate Senior Notes to be remarketed and deliver to the Remarketing Agent for remarketing all Separate Senior Notes delivered to the Custodial Agent pursuant to this Section 5.07(c) and not validly withdrawn prior to such date. In the event of a Successful Remarketing, after deducting the Remarketing Fee (to the extent permitted under the terms of the Remarketing Agreement), the Remarketing Agent will remit to the Custodial Agent the remaining portion of the proceeds of such Remarketing for payment to the Holders of the remarketed Separate Senior Notes, in accordance with their respective interests. In the event of a Failed Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent will promptly return such Separate Senior Notes to the Custodial Agent, and, in the event of a Failed Final Remarketing, the Custodial Agent shall deliver such Separate Senior Notes to the appropriate Holders. SECTION 5.08. Special Event Redemption. If the Collateral Agent receives written notice that a Special Event Redemption has occurred while Senior Notes are still credited to the Collateral Account, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Redemption Amount to be deposited in the Collateral Account and shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to apply the Redemption Amount to purchase the Treasury Portfolio, and to credit the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio to the Collateral Account and transfer the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (ii)(y) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio to the Warrant Agent for distribution to the Holders of the Corporate Units. Upon credit to the Collateral Account of the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio having a Value equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Pledged Senior Notes, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to release the Pledged Senior Notes from the Collateral Account and promptly transfer the Pledged Senior Notes to the Company. ARTICLE 6 VOTING RIGHTS - PLEDGED SENIOR NOTES SECTION 6.01. Voting Rights. Subject to the terms of Section 4.02 of the Warrant Agreement, the Warrant Agent may exercise, or refrain from exercising, any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Senior Notes or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement; provided, that the Warrant Agent shall not exercise or shall not refrain from exercising such right, as the case may be, if, in the judgment of the Warrant Agent, such action 22
would impair or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the value of all or any of the Pledged Senior Notes; and provided, further, that the Warrant Agent shall give the Company and the Collateral Agent at least five Business Days' prior written notice of the manner in which it intends to exercise, or its reasons for refraining from exercising, any such right. Upon receipt of any notices and other communications in respect of any Pledged Senior Notes, including notice of any meeting at which holders of the Senior Notes are entitled to vote or solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of the Senior Notes, the Collateral Agent shall use reasonable efforts to send promptly to the Warrant Agent such notice or communication, and as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of a written request therefor from the Warrant Agent, execute and deliver to the Warrant Agent such proxies and other instruments in respect of such Pledged Senior Notes (in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent) as are prepared by the Company and delivered to the Warrant Agent with respect to the Pledged Senior Notes. ARTICLE 7 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES SECTION 7.01. Rights and Remedies of the Collateral Agent. (a) In addition to the rights and remedies specified in Section 5.07 hereof or otherwise available at law or in equity, after an event of default (as specified in Section 7.01(b) below) hereunder, the Collateral Agent shall have all of the rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral of a secured party under the UCC (whether or not the UCC is in effect in the jurisdiction where the rights and remedies are asserted) and the TRADES Regulations and such additional rights and remedies to which a secured party is entitled under the laws in effect in any jurisdiction where any rights and remedies hereunder may be asserted. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such remedies may include, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (1) retention of the Pledged Senior Notes, Pledged Treasury Securities or the applicable Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in full satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the Warrants and the Warrant Agreement or (2) sale of the Pledged Senior Notes, Pledged Treasury Securities or the applicable Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in one or more public or private sales. (b) Without limiting any rights or powers otherwise granted by this Agreement to the Collateral Agent, in the event the Collateral Agent is unable to make payments to the Company on account of the applicable Pledged Applicable 23
Ownership Interests, or on account of principal payments of any Pledged Treasury Securities as provided in Article 3 hereof, in satisfaction of the Obligations of the Holder of the Units represented by such applicable Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests or such Pledged Treasury Securities, as applicable, under the related Warrants, the inability to make such payments shall constitute an event of default hereunder and the Collateral Agent shall have and may exercise, with reference to such Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests, as applicable, any and all of the rights and remedies available to a secured party under the UCC and the TRADES Regulations after default by a debtor, and as otherwise granted herein or under any other law. (c) Without limiting any rights or powers otherwise granted by this Agreement to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to receive and collect all payments of (i) the principal amount of the Pledged Senior Notes, (ii) the principal amount of the Pledged Treasury Securities and (iii) the principal amount of the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests, subject, in each case, to the provisions of Article 3 hereof, and as otherwise granted herein. (d) The Warrant Agent and each Holder of Units agrees that, from time to time, upon the written request of the Collateral Agent or the Warrant Agent, such Holder shall execute and deliver such further documents and do such other acts and things as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request or as may be necessary or advisable in order to maintain the Pledge, and the perfection and priority thereof, and to confirm the rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder. The Warrant Agent shall have no liability to any Holder for executing any documents or taking any such acts requested by the Collateral Agent hereunder, except for liability for its own grossly negligent acts, its own grossly negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct. SECTION 7.02. Special Event Redemption. Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption while Senior Notes are still credited to the Collateral Account, the Collateral Agent is hereby authorized to present the Pledged Senior Notes for payment as may be required by their respective terms and to direct the Indenture Trustee to remit the Redemption Price to the Securities Intermediary for credit to the Collateral Account on or prior to 12:30 p.m., New York City time on such Special Event Redemption Date, by federal funds check or wire transfer of immediately available funds. Upon receipt of such funds, the Pledged Senior Notes shall be released from the Collateral Account. Upon the crediting of such funds to the Collateral Account, the Collateral Agent, at the written direction of the Company, shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to (a) apply an amount equal to the Redemption Amount of such funds to purchase the Treasury Portfolio from the Quotation Agent, (b) credit to the Collateral Account the Applicable 24
Ownership Interests specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term and (c) promptly remit the remaining portion of such funds, if any, to the Warrant Agent for payment to the Holders of Corporate Units, in accordance with their respective interests. SECTION 7.03. Successful Remarketing. In the event of a Successful Remarketing prior to the Final Remarketing Date, the Collateral Agent shall, at the direction of the Company, instruct the Securities Intermediary to (i) Transfer the Pledged Senior Notes to the Remarketing Agent upon confirmation of deposit by the Remarketing Agent of the Proceeds of such Successful Remarketing (after deducting any Remarketing Fee to the extent permitted under the terms of the Remarketing Agreement) in the Collateral Account, (ii) apply an amount equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price to purchase from the Quotation Agent the Treasury Portfolio, (iii) credit the Applicable Ownership Interests specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term to the Collateral Account, and (iv) promptly remit the remaining portion of such Proceeds to the Warrant Agent for payment to the Holders of Corporate Units, in accordance with their respective interests. With respect to Separate Senior Notes, any Proceeds of such Remarketing (after deducting any Remarketing Fee to the extent permitted under the terms of the Remarketing Agreement) attributable to the Separate Senior Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of Separate Senior Notes. The Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests thus credited to the Collateral Account will secure the obligation of all Holders of Corporate Units to purchase Common Stock of the Company under the Warrants represented by such Corporate Units, in substitution for the Pledged Senior Notes, which shall be released from the Collateral Account. In the event of a Failed Final Remarketing, the Pledged Senior Notes shall remain credited to the Collateral Account. SECTION 7.04. Substitutions. Whenever a Holder has the right to substitute Treasury Securities, Senior Notes or security entitlements for any of them or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as defined in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, for financial assets held in the Collateral Account, such substitution shall not constitute a novation of the security interest created hereby. ARTICLE 8 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; COVENANTS 25

Each Holder from time to time, acting through the Warrant Agent as attorney-in-fact (it being understood that the Warrant Agent shall not be liable for any representation or warranty made by or on behalf of a Holder), hereby represents and warrants to the Collateral Agent (with respect to such Holder's interest in the Collateral), which representations and warranties shall be deemed repeated on each day a Holder Transfers Collateral, that: (a) such Holder has the power to grant a security interest in and lien on the Collateral; (b) such Holder is the sole beneficial owner of the Collateral and, in the case of Collateral delivered in physical form, is the sole holder of such Collateral and is the sole beneficial owner of, or has the right to Transfer, the Collateral it Transfers to the Collateral Agent for credit to the Collateral Account, free and clear of any security interest, lien, encumbrance, call, liability to pay money or other restriction other than the security interest and lien granted under Article 2 hereof; (c) upon the Transfer of the Collateral to the Collateral Agent for credit to the Collateral Account, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, will have a valid and perfected first priority security interest therein (assuming that any central clearing operation or any securities intermediary or other entity not within the control of the Holder involved in the Transfer of the Collateral, including the Collateral Agent and the Securities Intermediary, gives the notices and takes the action required of it hereunder and under applicable law for perfection of that interest and assuming the establishment and exercise of control pursuant to Article 4 hereof); and (d) the execution and performance by the Holder of its obligations under this Agreement will not result in the creation of any security interest, lien or other encumbrance on the Collateral other than the security interest and lien granted under Article 2 hereof or violate any provision of any existing law or regulation applicable to it or of any mortgage, charge, pledge, indenture, contract or undertaking to which it is a party or which is binding on it or any of its assets. SECTION 8.2. Covenants. The Holders from time to time, acting through the Warrant Agent as their attorney-in-fact (it being understood that the Warrant Agent shall not be liable for any covenant made by or on behalf of a Holder), hereby covenant to the Collateral Agent that for so long as the Collateral remains subject to the Pledge: 26

(b) The Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent or the Securities Intermediary shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, entitlement order, approval or other paper or document.
