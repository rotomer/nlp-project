file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement unless the Company has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, if the Registration Statement has become or becomes effective pursuant to Rule 430A, or filing of the Final Prospectus is otherwise required under Rule 424(b), the Company will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise the Representatives (A) when the Registration Statement, if not effective at the Execution Time, shall have become effective, (B) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or when any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have been filed with the Commission, (C) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (D) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (E) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (F) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. (ii) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the 10
respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (A) notify the Representatives of such event, (B) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of Section 5(a)(i), an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance and (C) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request.

The Company will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering. (v) The Company will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company be obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities, in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject. (vi) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company) directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration 11

(vii) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities. (viii) The Company will comply in all material respects with all applicable securities and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and will use its best efforts to cause the Company's directors and officers, in their capacities as such, to comply with such laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. (ix) The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that would constitute or that might reasonably be expected to cause or result in, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of the Securities.

(e) The Representatives shall have received from Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters. (f) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board or the President and the principal financial or accounting officer or the treasurer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, any supplements to the Final Prospectus and this Agreement and that: (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied in all material respects with all the 14
agreements and satisfied in all material respects all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). (g) The Company shall have requested and caused Ernst & Young LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder and that they have performed a review of the unaudited interim financial information of the Company for the three-month period ended March 31, 2003, and as at March 31, 2003, in accordance with Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, and stating in effect, except as provided in Schedule I hereto, that: (i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission; (ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of 15
significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and the executive, finance and audit committees of the Company and the Subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to March 31, 2003, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that: (A) any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements of the Act and with the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated by reference in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; (B) with respect to the period subsequent to March 31, 2003, there were any increases, at a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of the letter, in the long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or decreases in the shareholders' equity of the Company as compared with the amounts shown on March 31, 2003 consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from April 1, 2003 to May 31, 2003 there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in total revenues or premiums earned of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; or (C) the information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus in response to Regulation S-K, Item 301 (Selected Financial Data), Item 302 (Supplementary 16
Financial Information), Item 402 (Executive Compensation) and Item 503(d) (Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges) is not in conformity with the applicable disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K; (iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information set forth under the captions "Summary Historical Financial Data" and "Capitalization" in the Final Prospectus, the information included or incorporated by reference in Items 5-8 and 10-13 inclusive of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, and the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph 6(g) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter. (h) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in Section 6(g) or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). 17
(i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request. (j) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change. (k) The Company shall have used commercially reasonable best efforts to furnish, at the Execution Time, and the Company shall have furnished, on or prior to the Closing Date, to the Representatives a letter substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto from each executive officer and director of the Company addressed to the Representatives. If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing. The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Underwriters, at 450 Lexington Avenue, on the Closing Date. 7. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. 8. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The company agrees to indenmify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter. 18
within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in (A) the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, (B) under the heading "Underwriting": (i) the table listing the Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) following the table of Underwriters and their shares, the second paragraph and the fifth paragraph (including the four bullets thereunder relating to international offerings) and (iii) following the table regarding underwriting discounts and commissions, the first, second, and third paragraphs in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a 19
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph 8(a) or 8(b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph 8(a) or 8(b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "LOSSES") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the 20
Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph 8(d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph 8(d). 9. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of 21
Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 10. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (a) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission on the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on the New York Stock Exchange, (b) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (c) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). 11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. 12. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. General Counsel (fax no.: 22

Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers, directors, employees, agents and controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. 14. Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed within the State of New York. 15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 16. Headings.

EXHIBIT B FORM OF OPINION OF JOANNE L. BOBER, GENERAL COUNSEL TO THE COMPANY TO THE EFFECT THAT: (i) The Company has been duly qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing under the laws of each foreign jurisdiction in which it owns or leases properties, or conducts any business, so as to require such qualification, or is subject to no material liability or disability by reason of failure to be so qualified in any such jurisdiction; (ii) To the best of such counsel's knowledge and other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is the subject which would individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries; and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened; (iii) The issue and sale of the Securities and the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement and the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument known to me to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound to or which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, nor will such actions result in any violations of the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation known to me of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties, such as would be material to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; (iv) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for the issue and sale of the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement.
EXHIBIT C FORM OF OPINION OF DEBEVOISE & PLIMPTON TO THE EFFECT THAT: (i) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company under the law of the State of New York; (ii) The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Final Prospectus, will not be an "investment company" as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; (iii) No holders of securities of the Company have rights to the registration of such securities under the Registration Statement; (iv) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial data included therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion), as of the Execution Time, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, other than Regulation S-T; (v) The Registration Statement has become effective under the Act; any required filing of the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, and any supplements thereto, pursuant to Rule 424(b) has been made in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); to the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened and the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements and other financial information contained therein, as to which such counsel need express no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the respective rules thereunder; and such counsel has no reason to believe that on the Effective Date, or the date the Registration Statement was last deemed amended, or on the date of the Underwriting Agreement the Registration Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Final Prospectus as of its date on the Closing Date included or includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not

(vi) The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company) directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any shares of Common Stock or any securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, shares of Common Stock; or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, until the Business Day set forth on Schedule I hereto, provided, however, that (A) the Company may issue and sell 13,500,000 shares of Common Stock (or 15,525,000 if the Underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of Common Stock in full) in the concurrent offering, (B) the Company may issue and sell Common Stock pursuant to any employee stock option plan, stock ownership plan or dividend reinvestment plan of the Company in effect at the Execution Time, (C) the Company may issue Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of securities or the exercise of warrants outstanding at the Execution Time and (D) the Company may issue stock options and restricted stock to employees, provided that such options are not exercisable, and such restricted stock grants do not vest, before such date.

by it in relation to the Securities in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and (iv) the offer in The Netherlands of the Securities is exclusively limited to persons who trade or invest in securities in the conduct of a profession or business (which includes banks, stockbrokers, insurance companies, pension funds, other institutional investors and finance companies and treasury departments of large enterprises). 6. Conditions to the Obligations of the Underwriters. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Underwritten Securities and the Option Securities, as the case may be, shall be subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company contained herein as of the Execution Time, the Closing Date and any settlement date pursuant to Section 3 hereof, to the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions: (a) If the Registration Statement has not become effective prior to the Execution Time, unless the Representatives agree in writing to a later time, the Registration Statement will become effective not later than (i) 6:00 PM New York City time on the date of determination of the public offering price, if such determination occurred at or prior to 3:00 PM New York City time on such date or (ii) 9:30 AM on the Business Day following the day on which the public offering price was determined, if such determination occurred after 3:00 PM New York City time on such date; if filing of the Final Prospectus, or any supplement thereto, is required pursuant to Rule 424(b), the Final Prospectus, and any such supplement, will be filed in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted or threatened. (b) The Company shall have requested and caused Joanne L. Bober, General Counsel for the Company, to have furnished to the Representatives her opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B. (c) The Company shall have requested and caused Debevoise & Plimpton, outside counsel for the Company, to have furnished to the Representatives their opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit C. (d) The Company shall have requested and caused Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP, outside New Jersey counsel for the Company, to 15
have furnished to the Representatives their opinion, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit D. (e) The Representatives shall have received from Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters. (f) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company, signed by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board or the President and the principal financial or accounting officer or the treasurer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, any supplements to the Final Prospectus and this Agreement and that: (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company has complied in all material respects with all the agreements and satisfied in all material respects all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened; and (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse change in on the condition (financial or otherwise), prospects, earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). (g) The Company shall have requested and caused Ernst & Young LLP to have furnished to the Representatives, at the Execution 16
Time and at the Closing Date, letters (which may refer to letters previously delivered to one or more of the Representatives), dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, confirming that they are independent accountants within the meaning of the Act and the respective applicable rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder and that they have performed a review of the unaudited interim financial information of the Company for the three-month period ended March 31, 2003, and as at March 31, 2003, in accordance with Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, and stating in effect, except as provided in Schedule I hereto, that: (i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission; (ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; carrying out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the stockholders, directors and the executive, finance and audit committees of the Company and the Subsidiaries; and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries as to transactions and events subsequent to March 31, 2003, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that: (A) any unaudited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements of the Act and with the related rules and regulations adopted by the Commission with respect to financial statements included or incorporated by reference in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act; and said unaudited financial statements are not in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited financial statements included or incorporated by 17
reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus; (B) with respect to the period subsequent to March 31, 2003, there were any increases, at a specified date not more than five days prior to the date of the letter, in the long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or decreases in the shareholders' equity of the Company as compared with the amounts shown on the March 31, 2003 consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the period from April 1, 2003 to May 31, 2003 there were any decreases, as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year, in total revenues or premiums earned of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances for changes or decreases set forth in such letter, in which case the letter shall be accompanied by an explanation by the Company as to the significance thereof unless said explanation is not deemed necessary by the Representatives; or (C) the information included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and Final Prospectus in response to Regulation S-K, Item 301 (Selected Financial Data), Item 302 (Supplementary Financial Information), Item 402 (Executive Compensation) and Item 503(d) (Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges) is not in conformity with the applicable disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K; (iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a result of which they determined that certain information of an accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the Registration Statement, including the information set forth under the captions "Summary Historical Financial Data" and "Capitalization" in the Final Prospectus, the information included or incorporated by reference in Items 5-8 and 10-13 inclusive of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, and the information included in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, 18
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, agrees with the accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation. References to the Final Prospectus in this paragraph 6(g) include any supplement thereto at the date of the letter. (h) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in Section 6(g) or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). (i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request. (j) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change. (k) The Company shall have used commercially reasonable best efforts to furnish, at the Execution Time, and the Company shall have furnished, on or prior to the Closing Date, to the Representatives a letter substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto from each executive officer and director of the Company addressed to the Representatives. If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance 19
to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing. The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Underwriters, at 450 Lexington Avenue, on the Closing Date. 7. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Citigroup Global Markets Inc. on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. 8. Indemnification and Contribution. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion 20
therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting": (i) the table listing the Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) following the table of underwriters and their shares, the second paragraph and the fifth paragraph (including the four bullets thereunder relating to the international offerings) and (iii) following the table regarding underwriting discounts and commissions, the first, second, and third paragraphs in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph 8(a) or 8(b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph 8(a) or 8(b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel 21
with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "LOSSES") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to 22
state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph 8(d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph 8(d). 9. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 10. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior 23
to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (a) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission on the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on the New York Stock Exchange, (b) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (c) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). 11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. 12. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to Citigroup Global Markets Inc. General Counsel (fax no.: (212) 816-7912) and confirmed to the General Counsel, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, 10013, Attention: General Counsel; or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to the General Counsel, The Chubb Corporation (fax no.: 908-903-3607) and confirmed to it at the office of the General Counsel, The Chubb Corporation, 15 Mountain View Road, Warren, New Jersey 07059. 13. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers, directors, employees, agents and controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. 14. Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed within the State of New York. 15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 24

Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.

UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITARY FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REQUESTED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR SUCH OTHER NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITARY (AND ANY PAYMENT HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPOSITARY), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN. SECTION 2.02. Form of Purchase Contract Agent's Certificate of Authentication. The form of the Purchase Contract Agent's certificate of authentication of the Units shall be in substantially the form set forth on the form of the applicable Certificates. ARTICLE 3 THE UNITS SECTION 3.01. Amount; Form and Denominations. The aggregate number of Units evidenced by Certificates authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holders and delivered hereunder is limited to 18,400,000, except for Certificates authenticated, executed and delivered upon registration of transfer of, in exchange for, or in lieu of, other Certificates pursuant to Sections 3.04, 3.05, 3.10, 3.13, 3.14 or 8.05. The Certificates shall be issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Corporate Unit or Treasury Unit and any integral multiple thereof. SECTION 3.02. Rights and Obligations Evidenced by the Certificates. Each Corporate Units Certificate shall evidence the number of Corporate Units specified therein, with each such Corporate Unit representing (1) the ownership by the Holder thereof of a beneficial interest in a Senior Note or the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, subject to the Pledge of such Senior Note or the Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, by such Holder pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, and (2) the rights and obligations of the Holder thereof and the Company under one Purchase Contract. The Purchase Contract Agent is hereby authorized, as attorney-in-fact for, and on behalf of, the Holder of each Corporate Unit, to pledge, pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, the Senior Note and the Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, if any, represented by such Corporate Unit, to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company, and to grant to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, a security interest in the right, title and interest of such Holder in such Senior Note and the 22
Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, if any, to secure the obligation of the Holder under each Purchase Contract to pay the Stated Amount of such Purchase Contract and thereby purchase shares of Common Stock. Upon the formation of a Treasury Unit pursuant to Section 3.13, each Treasury Unit Certificate shall evidence the number of Treasury Units specified therein, with each such Treasury Unit representing (1) the ownership by the Holder thereof of a 1/40 undivided beneficial interest in a Treasury Security with a principal amount equal to $1,000, subject to the Pledge of such interest by such Holder pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, and (2) the rights and obligations of the Holder thereof and the Company under one Purchase Contract. The Purchase Contract Agent is hereby authorized, as attorney-in-fact for, and on behalf of, the Holder of each Treasury Unit, to pledge, pursuant to the Pledge Agreement, such Holder's interest in the Treasury Security represented by such Treasury Unit to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, and to grant to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, a security interest in the right, title and interest of such Holder in such Treasury Security to secure the obligation of the Holder under each Purchase Contract to pay the Stated Amount of such Purchase Contract and thereby purchase shares of Common Stock. Prior to the purchase of shares of Common Stock under any Purchase Contract, such Purchase Contract shall not entitle the Holder of the Unit representing such Purchase Contract to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock, including, without limitation, the right to vote or receive any dividends or other payments or to consent or to receive notice as a shareholder in respect of the meetings of shareholders or for the election of directors of the Company or for any other matter, or any other rights whatsoever as a shareholder of the Company. SECTION 3.03. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating. Subject to the provisions of Sections 3.13 and 3.14 hereof, upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and at any time and from time to time thereafter, the Company may deliver Certificates executed by the Company to the Purchase Contract Agent for authentication, execution on behalf of the Holders and delivery, together with its Issuer Order for authentication of such Certificates, and the Purchase Contract Agent in accordance with such Issuer Order shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holders and deliver such Certificates. The Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board of Directors, its Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, its Chief Executive Officer, its President, its Treasurer, its Secretary or one of its Vice Presidents. The signature of any of these officers on the Certificates may be manual or facsimile. Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Certificates. 23
No Purchase Contract evidenced by a Certificate shall be valid until such Certificate has been executed on behalf of the Holder by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the Purchase Contract Agent, as such Holder's attorney-in-fact. Such signature by an authorized officer of the Purchase Contract Agent shall be conclusive evidence that the Holder of such Certificate has entered into the Purchase Contracts evidenced by such Certificate. Each Certificate shall be dated the date of its authentication. No Certificate shall be entitled to any benefit under this Agreement or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by an authorized officer of the Purchase Contract Agent by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Certificate has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. SECTION 3.04. Temporary Certificates. Pending the preparation of definitive Certificates, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holders, and deliver, in lieu of such definitive Certificates, temporary Certificates that are in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A, Exhibit B or Exhibit C hereto, as the case may be, with such letters, numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements printed, lithographed or engraved thereon as may be required by the rules of any securities exchange on which the Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, are listed, or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers of the Company executing such Certificates, as evidenced by their execution of the Certificates. If temporary Certificates are issued, the Company will cause definitive Certificates to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Certificates, the temporary Certificates shall be exchangeable for definitive Certificates upon surrender of the temporary Certificates at the Corporate Trust Office, at the expense of the Company and without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Certificates, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver in exchange therefor, one or more definitive Certificates of like tenor and denominations and evidencing a like number of Units as the temporary Certificate or Certificates so surrendered. Until so exchanged, the temporary Certificates shall in all respects evidence the same benefits and the same obligations with respect to the Units evidenced thereby as definitive Certificates. SECTION 3.05. Registration; Registration of Transfer and Exchange. The Purchase Contract Agent shall keep at the Corporate Trust Office a register (the "SECURITY REGISTER") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Purchase Contract Agent shall provide for the registration of Certificates and of transfers of Certificates (the Purchase Contract Agent, in such capacity, the "SECURITY REGISTRAR"). The 24
Security Registrar shall record separately the registration and transfer of the Certificates evidencing Corporate Units and Treasury Units. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Certificate at the Corporate Trust Office, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the designated transferee or transferees, and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Certificates of any authorized denominations, like tenor, and evidencing a like number of Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be. At the option of the Holder, Certificates may be exchanged for other Certificates, of any authorized denominations and evidencing a like number of Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, upon surrender of the Certificates to be exchanged at the Corporate Trust Office. Whenever any Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver the Certificates that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Certificates issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate shall evidence the ownership of the same number of Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, and be entitled to the same benefits and subject to the same obligations under this Agreement as the Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, evidenced by the Certificate surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. Every Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Purchase Contract Agent) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent duly executed, by the Holder thereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of a Certificate, but the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require payment from the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Certificates, other than any exchanges pursuant to Sections 3.04, 3.06 and 8.05 not involving any transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be obligated to authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder and deliver any Certificate in exchange for any other Certificate presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange on or after the Business Day immediately preceding the earliest to occur of any Early Settlement Date with respect to such Certificate, any Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such Certificate, the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or the Termination Date. In lieu of delivery of a new Certificate, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent shall: 25
(i) if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (including upon any Cash Settlement) or an Early Settlement Date or a Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such other Certificate has occurred, deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of the Purchase Contracts represented by the Units evidenced by such other Certificate; or (ii) if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, transfer the Senior Notes, the Treasury Securities, or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, evidenced thereby, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3.15 and Article Five hereof. SECTION 3.06. Book-Entry Interests. The Certificates, on original issuance, will be issued in the form of one or more fully registered Global Certificates, to be delivered to the Depositary or its custodian by, or on behalf of, the Company. The Company hereby designates DTC as the initial Depositary. Such Global Certificates shall initially be registered on the books and records of the Company in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of the Depositary, and no Beneficial Owner will receive a definitive Certificate representing such Beneficial Owner's interest in such Global Certificate, except as provided in Section 3.09. The Purchase Contract Agent shall enter into an agreement with the Depositary if so requested by the Company. Unless and until definitive, fully registered Certificates have been issued to Beneficial Owners pursuant to Section 3.09: (i) the provisions of this Section 3.06 shall be in full force and effect; (ii) the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent shall be entitled to deal with the Depositary for all purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, making payments of Contract Adjustment Payments and receiving approvals, votes or consents hereunder) as the Holder of the Units and the sole holder of the Global Certificates and shall have no obligation to the Beneficial Owners; (iii) to the extent that the provisions of this Section 3.06 conflict with any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 3.06 shall control; and (iv) the rights of the Beneficial Owners shall be exercised only through the Depositary and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Beneficial Owners and the Depositary or the Depositary Participants. Transfers of securities evidenced by Global Certificates shall be made through the facilities of the Depositary, and any cancellation of, or increase or decrease in the number of, such securities (including the creation of Treasury Units and the recreation of Corporate Units pursuant to Sections 3.13 and 3.14, respectively) shall be accomplished by making appropriate annotations on the Schedule of Increases and Decreases for such Global Certificate. 26
SECTION 3.07. Notices to Holders. Whenever a notice or other communication to the Holders is required to be given under this Agreement, the Company or the Company's agent shall give such notices and communications to the Holders and, with respect to any Units registered in the name of the Depositary or the nominee of the Depositary, the Company or the Company's agent shall, except as set forth herein, have no obligations to the Beneficial Owners. SECTION 3.08. Appointment of Successor Depositary. If the Depositary elects to discontinue its services as securities depositary with respect to the Units, the Company may, in its sole discretion, appoint a successor Depositary with respect to the Units. SECTION 3.09. Definitive Certificates. If: (i) the Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue its services as securities depositary with respect to the Units and no successor Depositary has been appointed pursuant to Section 3.08 within 90 days after such notice; or (ii) the Depositary ceases to be a "clearing agency" registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act when the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as the Depositary and so notifies the Company, and no successor Depositary has been appointed pursuant to Section 3.08 within 90 days after such notice; or (iii) the Company determines in its discretion that the Global Certificates shall be exchangeable for definitive Certificates, then (x) definitive Certificates evidencing the Units shall be prepared by the Company and delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent and (y) upon surrender of the Global Certificates evidencing the Units by the Depositary, accompanied by registration instructions, the Company shall cause definitive Certificates to be delivered to Beneficial Owners in accordance with the instructions of the Depositary. The Company and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on and shall be authorized and protected in relying on, such instructions. Each definitive Certificate so delivered shall evidence Units of the same kind and tenor as the Global Certificate so surrendered in respect thereof. SECTION 3.10. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Certificates. If any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Certificate, 27
evidencing the same number of Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, and bearing a Certificate number not contemporaneously outstanding. If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to hold each of them and any agent of any of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent that such Certificate has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate, evidencing the same number of Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, and bearing a Certificate number not contemporaneously outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be obligated to authenticate, execute on behalf of the Holder, and deliver to the Holder, a Certificate on or after the Business Day immediately preceding the earliest of any Early Settlement Date with respect to such lost or mutilated Certificate, any Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such lost or mutilated Certificate, the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or the Termination Date. In lieu of delivery of a new Certificate, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions specified above in this Section and receipt of appropriate registration or transfer instructions from such Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent shall: (i) if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Certificate has occurred, deliver the shares of Common Stock issuable in respect of the Purchase Contracts represented by the Units evidenced by such Certificate; or (ii) if a Cash Settlement with respect to such lost or mutilated Certificate or if a Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, transfer the Senior Notes, the Treasury Securities or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, evidenced thereby, in each case subject to the applicable conditions and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3.15 and Article Five hereof. Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section, the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require the payment by the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other fees and expenses (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of the Purchase Contract Agent) connected therewith. Every new Certificate issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company and of the Holder in respect of the Units evidenced thereby, whether or not the destroyed, lost or 28
stolen Certificate (and the Units evidenced thereby) shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits and be subject to all the obligations of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Certificates delivered hereunder. The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude, to the extent lawful, all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates. SECTION 3.11. Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment of a Certificate for registration of transfer, the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent, and any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent, may treat the Person in whose name such Certificate is registered as the owner of the Units evidenced thereby for purposes of (subject to any applicable record date) any payment or distribution on the Senior Notes or on the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (ii) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio (if any), as applicable, payment of Contract Adjustment Payments and performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever in connection with such Units, whether or not such payment, distribution, or performance shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company nor the Purchase Contract Agent, nor any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent, shall be affected by notice to the contrary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Certificate, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent or any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary (or its nominee), as a Holder, with respect to such Global Certificate, or impair, as between such Depositary and the related Beneficial Owner, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of rights of the Depositary (or its nominee) as Holder of such Global Certificate. None of the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent or any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Global Certificate or maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests. SECTION 3.12. Cancellation. All Certificates surrendered for delivery of shares of Common Stock on or after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or upon the transfer of Senior Notes, or for delivery of the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, after the occurrence of a Termination Event or pursuant to a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or a Cash Merger Early Settlement, or upon the registration of transfer or exchange of a Unit, or a Collateral Substitution or the recreation of Corporate Units shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Purchase Contract Agent, be delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent along with appropriate written instructions regarding the cancellation thereof and, if not already cancelled, shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent for cancellation any Certificates previously authenticated, 29
executed and delivered hereunder that the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Certificates so delivered shall, upon an Issuer Order, be promptly cancelled by the Purchase Contract Agent. No Certificates shall be authenticated, executed on behalf of the Holder and delivered in lieu of or in exchange for any Certificates cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. All cancelled Certificates held by the Purchase Contract Agent shall be disposed of in accordance with its customary practices. If the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall acquire any Certificate, such acquisition shall not operate as a cancellation of such Certificate unless and until such Certificate is delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent cancelled or for cancellation. SECTION 3.13. Creation of Treasury Units by Substitution of Treasury Securities. Unless the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, a Holder may, at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, effect a Collateral Substitution and separate the Senior Notes represented by such Holder's Corporate Units from the Purchase Contracts so represented by substituting, for such Senior Notes, Treasury Securities in an aggregate principal amount at maturity equal to the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Notes; provided that Holders may make such Collateral Substitutions only in integral multiples of 40 Corporate Units. To effect such substitution, the Holder must: (1) deposit with the Securities Intermediary Treasury Securities having an aggregate principal amount at maturity equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes represented by such Corporate Units; and (2) transfer the related Corporate Units to the Purchase Contract Agent accompanied by a notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, (i) stating that the Holder has deposited the relevant amount of Treasury Securities with the Securities Intermediary and (ii) requesting that the Purchase Contract Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Senior Notes represented by such Corporate Units, whereupon the Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly provide an instruction to such effect to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit A to the Pledge Agreement. Upon receipt of the Treasury Securities described in clause (1) above and the instruction described in clause (2) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will cause the Securities Intermediary to effect the release of such Senior Notes from the Pledge, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and the transfer of such Senior Notes to the Purchase Contract Agent on behalf of the Holder. Upon receipt of such Senior Notes, the Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly: (i) cancel the related Corporate Units; 30
(ii) transfer the Senior Notes to the Holder (such Senior Notes shall be tradeable as a separate security, independent of the resulting Treasury Units); and (iii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver Treasury Units in book-entry form or, if applicable, in the form of a Treasury Units Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.03, representing the same number of Purchase Contracts as were represented by the cancelled Corporate Units. Holders who elect to separate the Senior Notes from the related Purchase Contracts and to substitute Treasury Securities for such Senior Notes shall be responsible for any fees or expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses payable to the Collateral Agent for its services as Collateral Agent) in respect of the substitution, and neither the Company nor the Purchase Contract Agent shall be responsible for any such fees or expenses. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, a Holder may, at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, substitute Treasury Securities for the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio represented by such Corporate Units, but only in integral multiples of 64,000 Corporate Units. In such an event, the Holder shall transfer Treasury Securities to the Securities Intermediary, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledge of and transfer to the Holder the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio in the manner set forth above. In the event a Holder making a Collateral Substitution pursuant to this Section 3.13 fails to effect a book-entry transfer of the Corporate Units or fails to deliver Corporate Units Certificates to the Purchase Contract Agent after depositing Treasury Securities with the Securities Intermediary, any distributions on the Senior Notes or Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio represented by such Corporate Units shall be held in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until such Corporate Units are so transferred or the Corporate Units Certificate is so delivered, as the case may be, or, such Holder provides evidence satisfactory to the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent that such Corporate Units Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent and the Company. Except as described in Section 5.02 or in this Section 3.13 or in connection with a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or a Termination Event, for so long as the Purchase Contract represented by a Corporate Unit remains in effect, such Corporate Units shall not be separable into the Purchase Contracts and Senior Notes or Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, represented thereby, and the rights and obligations of the Holder in respect of the Senior Notes or Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, and the Purchase Contract represented by such Corporate Units may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Corporate Unit. 31
SECTION 3.14. Recreation of Corporate Units. Unless the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, a Holder of Treasury Units may recreate Corporate Units at any time on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date; provided that Holders of Treasury Units may only recreate Corporate Units in integral multiples of 40 Treasury Units. To recreate Corporate Units, the Holder must: (1) transfer to the Securities Intermediary Senior Notes having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount at stated maturity of the Treasury Securities represented by the Treasury Units; and (2) transfer the related Treasury Units to the Purchase Contract Agent accompanied by a notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, (i) stating that the Holder has transferred the relevant amount of Senior Notes to the Securities Intermediary and (ii) requesting that the Purchase Contract Agent instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Treasury Securities represented by such Treasury Units, whereupon the Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly provide an instruction to such effect to the Collateral Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit C to the Pledge Agreement. Upon receipt of the Senior Notes described in clause (1) above and the instruction described in clause (2) above, in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent will cause the Securities Intermediary to effect the release of the Treasury Securities having a corresponding aggregate principal amount at maturity from the Pledge, free and clear of the Company's security interest therein, and the transfer thereof to the Purchase Contract Agent on behalf of the Holder. Upon receipt of such Treasury Securities, the Purchase Contract Agent shall promptly: (i) cancel the related Treasury Units; (ii) transfer the Treasury Securities to the Holder; and (iii) authenticate, execute on behalf of such Holder and deliver Corporate Units in book-entry form or, if applicable, in the form of a Corporate Units Certificate executed by the Company in accordance with Section 3.03, representing the same number of Purchase Contracts as were represented by the cancelled Treasury Units. Holders who elect to recreate Corporate Units shall be responsible for any fees or expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses payable to the Collateral Agent for its services as Collateral Agent) in respect of the recreation, and neither the Company nor the Purchase Contract Agent shall be responsible for any such fees or expenses. 32
If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, a Holder may at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date substitute the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio for Treasury Securities, but only in multiples of 64,000 Treasury Units. In such an event, the Holder shall transfer the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio to the Collateral Agent in an amount such that the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the portion of such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) is equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of the Purchase Contracts underlying such Treasury Units, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledge of and transfer to the Holder Treasury Securities in the manner set forth above. Except as provided in Section 5.02 or in this Section 3.14 or in connection with a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or a Termination Event, for so long as the Purchase Contract represented by a Treasury Unit remains in effect, such Treasury Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Treasury Unit in respect of the 1/40 of a Treasury Security and the Purchase Contract represented by such Treasury Unit may be acquired, and may be transferred and exchanged, only as a Treasury Unit. SECTION 3.15. Transfer of Collateral upon Occurrence of Termination Event. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event and the transfer to the Purchase Contract Agent of the Senior Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or the Treasury Securities, as the case may be, represented by the Corporate Units or the Treasury Units, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent shall request transfer instructions with respect to such Senior Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, from each Holder by written request, substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto, mailed to such Holder at its address as it appears in the Security Register. Upon book-entry transfer of the Corporate Units or the Treasury Units or delivery of a Corporate Units Certificate or Treasury Units Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent with such transfer instructions, the Purchase Contract Agent shall transfer the Senior Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, represented by such Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, to such Holder by book-entry transfer, or other appropriate procedures, in accordance with such instructions. In the event a Holder of Corporate Units or Treasury Units fails to effect such transfer or delivery, the Senior Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, represented by such Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be, and any distributions thereon, shall be held in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder, until the earlier to occur of: 33
(i) the transfer of such Corporate Units or Treasury Units or surrender of the Corporate Units Certificate or Treasury Units Certificate or the receipt by the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent from such Holder of satisfactory evidence that such Corporate Units Certificate or Treasury Units Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, together with any indemnity that may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent and the Company; and (ii) the expiration of the time period specified in the abandoned property laws of the relevant State in which the Purchase Contract Agent holds such property. SECTION 3.16. No Consent to Assumption. Each Holder of a Unit, by acceptance thereof, shall be deemed expressly to have withheld any consent to the assumption under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, of the Purchase Contract by the Company or its trustee, receiver, liquidator or a person or entity performing similar functions in the event that the Company becomes the debtor under the Bankruptcy Code or subject to other similar state or Federal law providing for reorganization or liquidation. ARTICLE 4 THE SENIOR NOTES AND APPLICABLE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE TREASURY PORTFOLIO SECTION 4.01. Interest Payments; Rights to Interest Payments Preserved. Any payment on any Senior Note or on the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (ii) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, which is paid on any Payment Date shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Purchase Contract Agent from the Collateral Agent as provided by the terms of the Pledge Agreement, be paid to the Person in whose name the Corporate Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Corporate Units Certificates) representing such Senior Note or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Each Corporate Units Certificate evidencing Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Corporate Units Certificate shall carry the right to accrued and unpaid interest or distributions, and to accrue interest or distributions, which were carried by the Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio represented by such other Corporate Units Certificate. In the case of any Corporate Unit with respect to which (A) Cash Settlement of the Purchase Contract represented by such Corporate Unit is properly effected pursuant to Section 34
5.02 hereof, (B) Early Settlement of the Purchase Contract represented by such Corporate Unit is properly effected pursuant to Section 5.07 hereof, (C) Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Purchase Contract represented by such Corporate Unit is properly effected pursuant to Section 5.04(b)(2) hereof, (D) a Collateral Substitution is properly effected pursuant to Section 3.13, or (E) a Successful Initial Remarketing occurs with respect to the Senior Note that is represented by such Corporate Unit, in each case on a date that is after any Record Date and prior to or on the next succeeding Payment Date, interest on the Senior Notes or distributions on the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, represented by such Corporate Unit otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Cash Settlement, Early Settlement, Cash Merger Early Settlement, Collateral Substitution or Initial Remarketing, and such payment or distributions shall, subject to receipt thereof by the Purchase Contract Agent, be payable to the Person in whose name the Corporate Units Certificate (or one or more Predecessor Corporate Units Certificates) was registered at the close of business on the Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, in the case of any Corporate Units with respect to which Cash Settlement, Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Purchase Contract represented by such Corporate Unit is properly effected, or with respect to which a Collateral Substitution has been effected, payments on the related Senior Notes or distributions on the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, that would otherwise be payable or made after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Early Settlement Date, Cash Merger Early Settlement Date or the date of the Collateral Substitution, as the case may be, shall not be payable hereunder to the Holder of such Corporate Units; provided, however, that to the extent that such Holder continues to hold Separate Senior Notes or Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio that were formerly represented by such Holder's Corporate Units, such Holder shall be entitled to receive interest on such Separate Senior Notes or distributions on the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio. SECTION 4.02. Notice and Voting. Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Senior Notes, but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders as described below. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Senior Notes are entitled to vote or upon any solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Senior Notes, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail, first class, postage pre-paid, to the Holders of Corporate Units a notice: (i) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation; (ii) stating that each Holder on the record date set by the Purchase Contract Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Senior Notes, as the case may be, entitled to vote) shall be 35
entitled to instruct the Purchase Contract Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to such Senior Notes represented by their Corporate Units; and (iii) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Holders of Corporate Units on such record date received by the Purchase Contract Agent at least six days prior to such meeting, the Purchase Contract Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum number of Senior Notes, as the case may be, as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Corporate Unit, the Purchase Contract Agent shall abstain from voting the Senior Notes represented by such Corporate Unit. The Company hereby agrees, if applicable, to solicit Holders of Corporate Units to timely instruct the Purchase Contract Agent in order to enable the Purchase Contract Agent to vote such Senior Notes. The Holders of Corporate Units and Treasury Units shall have no voting or other rights in respect of Common Stock. SECTION 4.03. Special Event Redemption. (a) If the Company elects to redeem the Senior Notes on any Payment Date following the occurrence of a Special Event as permitted by the Indenture, it shall notify the Collateral Agent in writing that a Special Event has occurred and that it intends to redeem the Senior Notes and the Special Event Redemption Date. On the Special Event Redemption Date, the Collateral Agent shall surrender the Pledged Senior Notes to the Indenture Trustee against delivery of an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Price for such Pledged Senior Notes. Thereafter, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to apply an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Amount of such funds to purchase on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units the Treasury Portfolio and promptly remit the remaining portion of such funds to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of such Corporate Units. (b) Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption, (i) the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio will be substituted as Collateral for the Pledged Senior Notes and will be held by the Securities Intermediary in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement to secure the obligation of each Holder of a Corporate Unit to pay the Stated Amount of the related Purchase Contract and thereby purchase Common Stock of the Company thereunder, (ii) the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interest rights and obligations with respect to such Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) as the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Senior Notes, as the case may be, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement, and (iii) any reference herein to the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Corporate Units Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to 36
reflect the substitution of the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio for Senior Notes as Collateral. (c) The Holders of Separate Senior Notes shall directly receive the redemption price for the Separate Senior Notes. ARTICLE 5 THE PURCHASE CONTRACTS SECTION 5.01. Purchase of Shares of Common Stock. (a) Each Purchase Contract shall obligate the Holder of the related Units to purchase, and the Company to sell, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date at a price equal to the Stated Amount, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock (subject to Section 5.09) equal to the Settlement Rate unless an Early Settlement, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or a Termination Event with respect to such Purchase Contract shall have occurred. The "SETTLEMENT RATE" is equal to: (i) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is greater than $71.40 (the "THRESHOLD APPRECIATION PRICE"), 0.3501 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract; (ii) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value is less than or equal to the Threshold Appreciation Price but greater than or equal to $59.50 (the "REFERENCE PRICE"), the number of shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract having a value equal to the Stated Amount divided by the Adjusted Applicable Market Value; (iii) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value is less than the Reference Price, 0.4202 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract; in each case subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.04 (and in each case rounded upward or downward to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share). The "APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, subject to adjustments set forth under Section 5.04 hereof. The "ADJUSTED APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means (i) prior to any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a), the Applicable Market Value, and (ii) at the time of and after any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of 37
Section 5.04(a), the Applicable Market Value multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) and the denominator shall be the Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that if such adjustment to the Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Settlement Rate. The "CLOSING PRICE" per share of Common Stock on any date of determination means: (i) the closing sale price as of the close of the principal trading session (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) per share on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") on such date; (ii) if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, the closing sale price (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) per share as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States national or regional securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed; (iii) if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, the last reported sale price per share as reported by The Nasdaq National Market, Inc.; (iv) if the Common Stock is not so reported by the Nasdaq National Market, Inc., the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization; or (v) if the bid price referred to in clause (iv) is not available, the market value of Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for purposes of determining the Closing Price. A "TRADING DAY" means a day on which the Common Stock (1) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (2) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock. (b) Each Holder of a Corporate Unit or a Treasury Unit, by its acceptance of such Unit: (i) irrevocably authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the Purchase Contract represented thereby on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact (including, without limitation, the execution of Certificates on behalf of such Holder); (ii) agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof; 38
(iii) covenants and agrees to perform its obligations under such Purchase Contract for so long as such Holder remains a Holder of a Corporate Unit or a Treasury Unit representing such Purchase Contract; (iv) consents to the provisions hereof; (v) irrevocably authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement on its behalf and in its name as its attorney-in-fact; (vi) consents to, and agrees to be bound by, the Pledge of such Holder's right, title and interest in and to the Collateral Account, including the Senior Notes and the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio or the Treasury Securities pursuant to the Pledge Agreement; and (vii) for United States federal, state and local tax purposes, agrees to (i) treat an acquisition of the Corporate Units as an acquisition of the Senior Note and Purchase Contract represented by each Corporate Unit, (ii) treat the Senior Notes as indebtedness of the Company and (iii) treat itself as the owner of the applicable interest in the Collateral Account, including the Senior Notes and the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) or the Treasury Securities, provided that upon a Termination Event, the rights of the Holder of such Units under the Purchase Contract may be enforced without regard to any other rights or obligations. (c) Each Holder of a Corporate Unit or a Treasury Unit, by its acceptance thereof, further covenants and agrees that to the extent and in the manner provided in Section 5.02 and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, the Treasury Securities or the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable, on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such Proceeds. (d) Upon registration of transfer of a Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee) by the terms of this Agreement, the Purchase Contracts represented by such Certificate and the Pledge Agreement and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under this Agreement, the Purchase Contracts represented by the Certificate so transferred and the Pledge Agreement. The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Certificate, by its acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. SECTION 5.02. Remarketing; Payment of Stated Amount. 39
(a) (i) Unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the Initial Remarketing Date, the Company shall engage the Remarketing Agent pursuant to the Remarketing Agreement for Remarketing the Senior Notes. By 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Initial Remarketing Date, the Purchase Contract Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes, and the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed pursuant to clause (ii) below. Concurrently, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, will present for Remarketing the Pledged Senior Notes, and the Custodial Agent, pursuant to clause (ii) below, will present for Remarketing the Separate Senior Notes, to the Remarketing Agent. Upon receipt of such notice from the Purchase Contract Agent and Custodial Agent and the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) from the Collateral Agent and Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Initial Remarketing Date, use its reasonable efforts to remarket (based on the Reset Rate) (the "INITIAL REMARKETING") such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes on such date at a price of approximately (but not less than) 100.50% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes at a price not less than 100.50% of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price (a "SUCCESSFUL INITIAL REMARKETING"), the portion of the proceeds from such Successful Initial Remarketing equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price will be applied to purchase the Treasury Portfolio. The Remarketing Agent shall deduct as a remarketing fee (the "REMARKETING FEE") an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (0.25%) of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. None of the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent, or any Holders of Corporate Units or holders of Separate Senior Notes whose Senior Notes or Separate Senior Notes, as applicable, are so remarketed will otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. With respect to Separate Senior Notes, the proceeds of a Successful Initial Remarketing in excess of the Remarketing Fee attributable to the Separate Senior Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of Separate Senior Notes. With respect to Pledged Senior Notes, the proceeds of a Successful Initial Remarketing in excess of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Remarketing Fee with respect to such Pledged Senior Notes will be remitted to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of the related Corporate Units. The Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Pledged Senior Notes and the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio will be pledged to the Collateral Agent to secure the obligation of the Holders of Corporate Units to pay the Stated Amount for the Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Following the occurrence of a Successful Initial Remarketing, the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the 40
definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio as the Holder of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Senior Notes, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement, and any reference herein or in the Certificates to the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio and any reference herein or in the Certificates to interest on the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Corporate Units Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio for Senior Notes. If, in spite of using its reasonable efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) in the Initial Remarketing (other than to the Company) at a price not less than 100.50% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price or the Initial Remarketing is not settled in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement for any reason, including the failure to fulfill a condition precedent set forth in the Remarketing Agreement, the Initial Remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "FAILED INITIAL REMARKETING"). Upon a Failed Initial Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) subject to such Remarketing to the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be. (ii) Prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, but no earlier than the Payment Date immediately preceding such date, Holders of Separate Senior Notes may elect to have their Separate Senior Notes remarketed under the Remarketing Agreement by delivering their Separate Senior Notes, along with a notice of such election, substantially in the form of Exhibit F to the Pledge Agreement, to the Custodial Agent. After such time, such election shall become an election to have such Separate Senior Notes remarketed in such Remarketing and, if such Remarketing fails, in any subsequent Remarketing. The Custodial Agent shall hold Separate Senior Notes in an account separate from the Collateral Account in which the Pledged Senior Notes shall be held. Holders of Separate Senior Notes electing to have their Separate Senior Notes remarketed will also have the right to withdraw that election by written notice to the Custodial Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit G to the Pledge Agreement, on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, upon which notice the Custodial Agent shall return such Separate Senior Notes to such Holder. By 11:00 a.m. on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of the Separate Senior Notes to be remarketed and will deliver to the Remarketing Agent for remarketing all such Separate Senior Notes delivered to the Custodial Agent pursuant to Section 5.07(c) of the Pledge Agreement and not validly withdrawn prior to such date. 41
(iii) Not later than seven calendar days nor more than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable Remarketing Date, the Company shall request the Depositary or its nominee to notify the Beneficial Owners or Depositary Participants holding Units of the procedures to be followed in such Remarketing. (iv) The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, if required by applicable law, a registration statement with regard to the full amount of the Senior Notes to be remarketed in the Initial Remarketing, the Second Remarketing, the Third Remarketing or the Final Remarketing, as the case may be, shall be effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a form that will enable the Remarketing Agent to use it in connection with such Remarketing. (v) The Company shall cause a notice of a Failed Remarketing to be published (with a copy of such notice to be provided to the Purchase Contract Agent) on the Business Day immediately following the applicable Remarketing Date, in a daily newspaper in the English language of general circulation in the City of New York, which is expected to be The Wall Street Journal. (b) (i) Unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the Second Remarketing Date, if a Failed Initial Remarketing occurs, the Remarketing Agent will use its reasonable efforts to remarket the Senior Notes (a "SECOND REMARKETING") on the Second Remarketing Date. By 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Second Remarketing Date for such Second Remarketing, the Purchase Contract Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes, and the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii). Concurrently, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, and the Custodial Agent, pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii), will present for Remarketing the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed to the Remarketing Agent. Upon receipt of such notice from the Purchase Contract Agent and the Custodial Agent and Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) from the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Second Remarketing Date, use its reasonable efforts to remarket (based on the Reset Rate) such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes on such date at a price of approximately (but not less than) 100.50% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes at a price not less than 100.50% of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price (a "SUCCESSFUL SECOND REMARKETING"), the portion of the proceeds from such Successful Second Remarketing equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price will be applied to purchase the Treasury Portfolio. The Remarketing Agent shall deduct the Remarketing Fee from any amount of such proceeds in excess of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. None of the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holders of Corporate Units or holders of Separate Senior Notes 42
whose Senior Notes or Separate Senior Notes are so remarketed will otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. With respect to Separate Senior Notes, the proceeds of the Second Remarketing in excess of the Remarketing Fee attributable to the Separate Senior Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of Separate Senior Notes. With respect to Pledged Senior Notes, the proceeds of the Second Remarketing in excess of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Remarketing Fee with respect to such Pledged Senior Notes will be remitted to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of the related Corporate Units. The Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Pledged Senior Notes and the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio will be pledged to the Collateral Agent to secure the obligation of the Holders of Corporate Units to pay the Stated Amount for the Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Following the occurrence of a Successful Second Remarketing, the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio as the Holder of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the related Senior Notes, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement, and any reference herein or in the Certificates to the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio and any reference herein or in the Certificates to interest on the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Corporate Units Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio for Senior Notes. If, in spite of using its reasonable efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) in a Second Remarketing (other than to the Company) at a price not less than 100.50% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price or the Second Remarketing is not settled in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement for any reason, including the failure to fulfill a condition precedent set forth in the Remarketing Agreement, the Second Remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "FAILED SECOND REMARKETING"). Upon a Failed Second Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) subject to such Remarketing to the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be. (ii) Unless a Special Event Redemption has occurred prior to the Third Remarketing Date, if a Failed Second Remarketing occurs, the Remarketing Agent will use its reasonable efforts to remarket the Senior Notes (a "THIRD REMARKETING") on the Third Remarketing Date. By 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day 43
immediately preceding the Third Remarketing Date for such Third Remarketing, the Purchase Contract Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes, and the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii). Concurrently, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, and the Custodial Agent, pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii), will present for Remarketing the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) that are to be remarketed to the Remarketing Agent. Upon receipt of such notice from the Purchase Contract Agent and the Custodial Agent and such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes from the Collateral Agent and the Custodial Agent, the Remarketing Agent will, on the Third Remarketing Date, use its reasonable efforts to remarket (based on the Reset Rate) such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes on such date at a price of approximately (but not less than) 100.50% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes at a price not less than 100.50% of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price (a "SUCCESSFUL THIRD REMARKETING"), the portion of the proceeds from such Successful Third Remarketing equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price will be applied to purchase the Treasury Portfolio. The Remarketing Agent shall deduct the Remarketing Fee from any amount of such proceeds in excess of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price. None of the Company, the Purchase Contract Agreement or any Holders of Corporate Units or holders of Separate Senior Notes whose Senior Notes or Separate Senior Notes are so remarketed will otherwise be responsible for the payment of any Remarketing Fee in connection therewith. With respect to Separate Senior Notes, the proceeds of the Third Remarketing in excess of the Remarketing Fee attributable to the Separate Senior Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of Separate Senior Notes. With respect to Pledged Senior Notes, the proceeds of the Third Remarketing in excess of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Remarketing Fee with respect to such Pledged Senior Notes will be remitted to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of the related Corporate Units. The Treasury Portfolio will be substituted for the Pledged Senior Notes and the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio will be pledged to the Collateral Agent to secure the obligation of the Holders of Corporate Units to pay the Stated Amount for the Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Following the occurrence of a Successful Third Remarketing, the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interests (with respect to the Collateral Agent), rights and obligations with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio as the Holder of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Senior Notes, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement, and any reference herein or in the Certificates to the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a 44
reference to such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio and any reference herein or in the Certificates to interest on the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to corresponding distributions on such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio. The Company may cause to be made in any Corporate Units Certificates thereafter to be issued such change in phraseology and form (but not in substance) as may be appropriate to reflect the substitution of such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio for Senior Notes. If, in spite of using its reasonable efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) in a Third Remarketing (other than to the Company) at a price not less than 100.50% of the sum of the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price plus the Separate Senior Notes Purchase Price or the Third Remarketing is not settled in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement for any reason, including the failure to fulfill a condition precedent set forth in the Remarketing Agreement, the Third Remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "FAILED THIRD REMARKETING"). Upon a Failed Third Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes (if any) subject to such Remarketing to the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be. (c) (i) Unless a Special Event Redemption, an Early Settlement or a Cash Merger Early Settlement has occurred prior to the Final Remarketing Date, if no Successful Remarketing has occurred prior to the Final Remarketing Date, each Holder shall have the right to satisfy such Holder's obligations under the Purchase Contract on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in cash by notifying the Purchase Contract Agent by use of a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit F hereto of its intention to pay in cash ("CASH SETTLEMENT") prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Promptly following 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Purchase Contract Agent shall notify the Collateral Agent and the Indenture Trustee of the receipt of such notices from Holders intending to make a Cash Settlement. (ii) A Holder of a Corporate Unit who has so notified the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement shall pay the Stated Amount to the Securities Intermediary for deposit in the Collateral Account prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashiers' check or wire transfer, in each case in immediately available funds payable to or upon the order of the Securities Intermediary. Any cash so received shall be invested promptly by the Securities Intermediary in Permitted Investments and paid to the Company on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in settlement of the Purchase Contracts in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Any funds received by the Securities Intermediary in respect of the investment earnings from such Permitted Investments in excess of the Stated Amount for the shares of Common Stock to be 45
purchased by such Holder shall be distributed to the Purchase Contract Agent when received for payment to the Holder. (iii) If a Holder of a Corporate Unit does not notify the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement in accordance with paragraph 5.02(c)(i) above, or does notify the Purchase Contract Agent in accordance with paragraph 5.02(c)(i) above but fails to make such payment as required by paragraph 5.02(c)(ii) above, such Holder shall be deemed to have consented to the disposition of the Pledged Senior Notes pursuant to the Final Remarketing as described in paragraph 5.02(d) below. (iv) Promptly after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent, based on cash payments received by the Securities Intermediary pursuant to Section 5.02(c)(ii) hereof, shall promptly notify the Purchase Contract Agent and the Indenture Trustee of the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes to be tendered for purchase in the Final Remarketing in a notice pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement. (d) (i) Unless a Special Event Redemption, an Early Settlement or a Cash Merger Early Settlement has occurred prior to the Final Remarketing Date, if a Failed Third Remarketing has occurred, the Senior Notes of such Holders of Corporate Units who have not notified the Purchase Contract Agent of their intention to effect a Cash Settlement as provided in paragraph 5.02(c)(i) above, or who have so notified the Purchase Contract Agent in accordance with paragraph 5.02(c)(i) above but have failed to make such payment as required by paragraph 5.02(c)(ii) above, and the Separate Senior Notes of any holder who has elected for its Separate Senior Notes to be remarketed pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii) will be sold by the Remarketing Agent (the "FINAL REMARKETING") on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (the "FINAL REMARKETING DATE"). In order to facilitate the Final Remarketing, the Purchase Contract Agent, based on the notices specified in Section 5.02(c)(iv), and the Collateral Agent, based on the notices specified in Section 5.02(a)(ii), shall notify the Remarketing Agent, by 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the Final Remarketing Date, of the aggregate principal amount of Pledged Senior Notes or aggregate principal amount of Separate Senior Notes that are to be remarketed pursuant to Section 5.02(a)(ii), as the case may be, to be remarketed. Concurrently, the Collateral Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, and the Custodial Agent shall cause such Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes to be presented to the Remarketing Agent for Remarketing. (ii) Upon receipt of such notice from the Purchase Contract Agent and the Collateral Agent and the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) from the Collateral Agent or Custodial Agent, as set forth in clause (i) above, the Remarketing Agent shall, on the Final Remarketing Date, use its reasonable efforts to remarket (based on the Reset Rate) such Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes on such date equal to approximately 100.50% (or, if the Remarketing Agent is unable to remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and the Separate Senior Notes at such price, at a price 46
below 100.50%, but in no event less than 100%, net of the Final Remarketing Fee) of the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes being remarketed, as provided in the Remarketing Agreement. If the Remarketing Agent is able to remarket the Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes at a price equal to or greater than 100% (net of the Final Remarketing Fee) of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) (a "SUCCESSFUL FINAL REMARKETING"), the Remarketing Agent will remit the proceeds attributable to the Remarketing of the Pledged Senior Notes from such Successful Final Remarketing to the Securities Intermediary. The Remarketing Agent shall deduct as the remarketing fee (the "FINAL REMARKETING FEE") an amount not exceeding 25 basis points (0.25%) of the aggregate principal amount of the remarketed Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any); provided that such fee shall be payable out of, and only to the extent of, remarketing proceeds, if any, in excess of such amount. With respect to Separate Senior Notes, any proceeds of the Final Remarketing in excess of the Final Remarketing Fee attributable to the Separate Senior Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of Separate Senior Notes. The proceeds from the Remarketing remitted to the Securities Intermediary shall be invested by the Collateral Agent in Permitted Investments, in accordance with the Pledge Agreement, and then applied to satisfy in full the obligations of such Holders of Corporate Units to pay the Stated Amount for the shares of Common Stock under the related Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Any proceeds in excess of those required to pay the Stated Amount and the Final Remarketing Fee will be remitted to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of the related Corporate Units. (iii) If, in spite of using its reasonable efforts, the Remarketing Agent cannot remarket the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) at a price not less than 100% (net of the Final Remarketing Fee) of the aggregate principal amount of the Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes to be remarketed in the Final Remarketing (other than to the Company) or the Final Remarketing is not settled in accordance with the Remarketing Agreement for any reason, including the failure to fulfill a condition precedent set forth in the Remarketing Agreement, the remarketing will be deemed to have failed (a "FAILED FINAL REMARKETING"). Upon a Failed Final Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent shall return the remarketed Pledged Senior Notes and Separate Senior Notes (if any) to the Collateral Agent or the Custodial Agent, as the case may be. Upon a Failed Final Remarketing, a default shall be deemed to have occurred under this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement and in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, shall exercise its rights as a secured party with respect to the Pledged Senior Notes, including, without limitation, those actions specified in paragraph 5.02(e) below; provided that if upon a Failed Final Remarketing, the Collateral Agent exercises such rights for the benefit of the Company with respect to such Senior Notes, any accrued and unpaid interest on such Senior Notes shall become payable by the Company to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Beneficial Owner of the Corporate Units to which such Senior Notes relate. 47
(e) With respect to any Pledged Senior Notes that are subject to a Failed Final Remarketing, and any Senior Notes that are represented by a Corporate Unit with respect to which the Holder has notified the Purchase Contract Agent of his intent to effect Cash Settlement and failed to deliver the Stated Amount pursuant to Section 5.02(c)(ii), in each case resulting in an event of default under this Agreement, the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Company reserves all of its rights as a secured party with respect thereto and, subject to applicable law and paragraph 5.02(i) below, may, in full satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts among other things, (A) retain the Senior Notes in accordance with applicable law or (B) dispose of the Senior Notes in accordance with applicable law, which in each case shall constitute payment in full for the aggregate Stated Amount for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased under the Purchase Contracts. (f) (i) Unless a Holder of a Treasury Unit or a Corporate Unit (if the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by such Corporate Unit) effects an Early Settlement of the Purchase Contract represented by such Unit through the early delivery of cash to the Purchase Contract Agent in the manner described in Section 5.07 or a Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Purchase Contract represented by such Unit through the early delivery of cash to the Purchase Contract Agent in the manner described in Section 5.04(b)(2), each Holder of a Treasury Unit or a Corporate Unit who intends to effect Cash Settlement of the Purchase Contract represented by such Unit shall so notify the Purchase Contract Agent by use of a notice in substantially the form of Exhibit F hereto prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. Prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the next succeeding Business Day, the Purchase Contract Agent shall notify the Collateral Agent of the receipt of such notices from such Holders intending to make a Cash Settlement. Holders of Treasury Units may make Cash Settlements only in integral multiples of 40 Corporate Units. (ii) A Holder of a Treasury Unit or a Corporate Unit (if the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Note represented by such Corporate Unit) who has so notified the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement in accordance with paragraph 5.02(f)(i) above shall pay the Stated Amount to the Securities Intermediary for deposit in the Collateral Account prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, in lawful money of the United States by certified or cashiers' check or wire transfer, in each case in immediately available funds payable to or upon the order of the Securities Intermediary. Any cash received by the Securities Intermediary shall be invested promptly by the Collateral Agent in Permitted Investments and paid to the Company on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in settlement of the Purchase Contract in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Any funds received by the Securities Intermediary in respect of the investment earnings from the investment in such Permitted Investments in excess of the Stated Amount for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased by such Holder shall be distributed to the Purchase Contract Agent when received for payment to the Holder. 48
(iii) If a Holder of a Treasury Unit or a Corporate Unit (if the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Note represented by such Corporate Unit) fails to notify the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to make a Cash Settlement in accordance with Section 5.02(f)(i), or does notify the Purchase Contract Agent as provided in Section 5.02(f)(i) of its intention to pay the Stated Amount in cash, but fails to make such payment as required by Section 5.02(f)(ii), then upon the maturity of the Pledged Treasury Securities or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio held by the Securities Intermediary on or prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the principal amount of the Treasury Securities or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio received by the Collateral Agent shall be invested promptly in Permitted Investments. On the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, an amount equal to the Stated Amount shall be remitted to the Company as payment of such Holder's obligation to pay such Stated Amount under the related Purchase Contracts without receiving any instructions from the Holder. In the event the sum of the Proceeds from related Pledged Treasury Securities or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio and the Proceeds from such Permitted Investments is in excess of the aggregate Stated Amount, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to distribute such excess to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holder of the related Treasury Units or Corporate Units when received. (g) Any distribution to Holders of any payments described above shall be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in New York City maintained for that purpose or, at the option of the Holder, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the Security Register. (h) Upon Cash Settlement of any Purchase Contract: (i) the Collateral Agent will in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement cause the Pledged Senior Notes, the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio or the Pledged Treasury Securities, as the case may be, represented by the relevant Units to be released from the Pledge, free and clear of any security interest of the Company, and transferred to the Purchase Contract Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof or its designee as soon as practicable; and (ii) subject to the receipt thereof, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, by book-entry transfer or other appropriate procedures, in accordance with written instructions provided by the Holder thereof, transfer such Senior Notes, or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio or such Treasury Securities, as the case may be (or, if no such instructions are given to the Purchase Contract Agent by the Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent shall hold such Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership 49
Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio or such Treasury Securities, as the case may be, and any interest payment thereon, in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent or its nominee in trust for the benefit of such Holder until the expiration of the time period specified in the abandoned property laws of the relevant state where such property is held). (i) The obligations of the Holders to pay the Stated Amount are non-recourse obligations and, except to the extent satisfied by Early Settlement, Cash Merger Early Settlement or Cash Settlement, are payable solely out of the proceeds of any Collateral pledged to secure the obligations of the Holders, and in no event will Holders be liable for any deficiency between the proceeds of the disposition of Collateral and the Stated Amount. (j) The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates thereof to the Holder of the related Units unless the Company shall have received payment of the Stated Amount for the Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner herein set forth. SECTION 5.03. Issuance of Shares of Common Stock. Unless a Termination Event, an Early Settlement or a Cash Merger Early Settlement shall have occurred, subject to Section 5.04(b), on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date upon receipt of the aggregate Stated Amount payable on all Outstanding Units, the Company shall issue and deposit with the Purchase Contract Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of the Outstanding Units, one or more certificates representing newly issued shares of Common Stock registered in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent (or its nominee) as custodian for the Holders (such certificates for shares of Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions for which a record date and payment date for such dividend or distribution has occurred after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, being hereinafter referred to as the "PURCHASE CONTRACT SETTLEMENT FUND") to which the Holders are entitled hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, upon surrender of a Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent on or after the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be, together with settlement instructions thereon duly completed and executed, the Holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive forthwith in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of newly issued whole shares of Common Stock which such Holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article Five (after taking into account all Units then held by such Holder), together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 5.09 and any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares constituting part of the Purchase Contract Settlement Fund, but without any interest thereon, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Such shares shall be registered in the name of the Holder or the Holder's designee as specified in the settlement instructions provided by the Holder to the Purchase Contract Agent. If any shares of Common Stock issued in respect of a Purchase Contract are to be registered to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered (but excluding any Depositary or nominee thereof), no such registration shall be made unless the Person requesting such registration has paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such registration in a name other than that of the registered Holder of the Certificate evidencing 50
such Purchase Contract or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax either has been paid or is not payable. SECTION 5.04. Adjustment of Settlement Rate. (a) Adjustments for Dividends, Distributions, Stock Splits, Etc. (1) In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution on Common Stock in Common Stock, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution shall be increased by dividing such Settlement Rate by a fraction of which: (i) the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such determination; and (ii) the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution, such increase to become effective immediately at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such determination. For the purposes of this paragraph (1), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company agrees that it shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. (2) In case the Company shall issue rights, warrants or options, other than pursuant to any dividend reinvestment plans or share purchase plans, to all holders of its Common Stock (not being available on an equivalent basis to Holders of the Units upon settlement of the Purchase Contracts represented by such Units) entitling them, for a period expiring within 45 days after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such rights, warrants or options, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date of announcement of such issuance, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the date of such announcement shall be increased by dividing such Settlement Rate by a fraction of which: (i) the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of such announcement plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such Current Market Price; and (ii) the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of such announcement plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase, 51
such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Business Day following the date of such announcement. The Company agrees that it shall notify the Purchase Contract Agent if any issuance of such rights, warrants or options is cancelled or not completed following the announcement thereof and the Settlement Rate shall thereupon be readjusted to the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the date of such announcement. For the purposes of this paragraph (2), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include any shares issuable in respect of any scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company agrees that it shall not issue any such rights, warrants or options in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. (3) In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or split into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the day preceding the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective shall be proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the day preceding the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to become effective immediately at the opening of business on the day following the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective. (4) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including shares of capital stock, securities, cash and property but excluding any rights, warrants or options referred to in paragraph (2) of this Section 5.04(a), any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash and any dividend or distribution referred to in paragraph (1) of this Section 5.04(a)), the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution shall be adjusted by dividing such rate by a fraction of which: (i) the numerator shall be the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date fixed for such determination less the then fair market value (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be described in a Board Resolution) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock; and (ii) the denominator shall be such Current Market Price per share of Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution. In any case in which this paragraph (4) is applicable, paragraph (2) of this Section 5.04(a) shall not be applicable. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Settlement Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Settlement Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. 52
(5) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock cash (excluding any cash that is distributed in a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.04(b) applies, as part of a distribution referred to in paragraph (4) of this Section or as a regular quarterly cash distribution) in an aggregate amount that, combined together with (I) the aggregate amount of any other distributions (other than regular quarterly cash distributions) to all holders of its Common Stock made exclusively in cash within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution (the "TRAILING 12 MONTH PERIOD") and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (5) or paragraph (6) of this Section has been made and (II) the aggregate amount of any cash plus the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution) of consideration (other than consideration payable in respect of any odd-lot tender offer) payable in respect of any tender or exchange offer by the Company or any of its subsidiaries and calculated as of the expiration of such tender or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock concluded within the Trailing 12 Month Period and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (5) or paragraph (6) of this Section has been made, exceeds 10% of the product of the Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock on the date for the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date, then, in such case, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on such record date shall be adjusted by dividing such rate by a fraction of which: (i) the numerator shall be the Current Market Price of Common Stock on such record date less the amount of cash so distributed (and not excluded as provided above) applicable to one share of Common Stock; and (ii) the denominator shall be the Current Market Price of Common Stock, such increase to be effective at the opening of business on the day following the record date; provided, however, that in the event the portion of cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the record date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each holder of a Unit shall have the right to receive upon settlement of the Units the amount of cash such Holder would have received had such Holder settled each Unit on the record date. In the event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Settlement Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Settlement Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. (6) If the Company or any subsidiary of the Company shall make a tender or exchange offer (other than any odd-lot tender offer) for all or any portion of the Common Stock and upon expiration of such tender or exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof) the Company or its subsidiary shall be required to pay to shareholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of Purchased Shares (as herein defined) any consideration, then if the sum of (I) the fair market value of the aggregate consideration to be paid in such tender offer or exchange offer (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be 53
described in a Board Resolution) plus (II) the aggregate of the cash plus the fair market value (as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and the basis for which shall be described in a Board Resolution), as of the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, of consideration payable in respect of any other tender or exchange offer (other than consideration payable in respect of any odd-lot tender offer), by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any portion of Common Stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender or exchange offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (6) has been made, plus (III) the aggregate amount of any distributions (other than regular quarterly cash distributions) to all holders of Common Stock made exclusively in cash within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender or exchange offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to paragraph (5) has been made, exceeds 10% of the product of the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock as of the last time (the "EXPIRATION TIME") tenders could have been made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended) times the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) at the Expiration Time, then, the Settlement Rate in effect at the close of business on the day of the Expiration Time shall be adjusted by dividing by a fraction: (i) the numerator of which shall be equal to (A) the product of (I) the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock on the date of the Expiration Time and (II) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) on the date of the Expiration Time less (B) the amount of cash plus the fair market value (determined as aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to shareholders based on the transactions described in clauses (I), (II) and (III) above (assuming in the case of clause (I) the acceptance, up to any maximum specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer, of Purchased Shares); and (ii) the denominator of which shall be equal to the product of (A) the Current Market Price per share of Common Stock as of the Expiration Time and (B) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) as of the Expiration Time less the number of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up to any such maximum, being referred to as the "PURCHASED SHARES"), such adjustment to become effective at the opening of business on the date following the date of the Expiration Time. (7) The reclassification of Common Stock into securities including securities other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon a Reorganization Event to which Section 5.04(b) applies) shall be deemed to involve: (i) a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution" and the "date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of paragraph (4) of this Section); and 54
(ii) a subdivision, split or combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such subdivision or split becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes effective", as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision, split or combination becomes effective" within the meaning of paragraph (3) of this Section). (8) The "CURRENT MARKET PRICE" per share of Common Stock on any date of determination means the average of the daily Closing Prices on each of the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days ending on the earlier of such date of determination and the day before the "ex date" with respect to the issuance or distribution requiring the computation. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "ex date," when used with respect to any issuance or distribution, shall mean the first date on which Common Stock trades regular way on such exchange or in such market without the right to receive such issuance or distribution. (9) All adjustments to the Settlement Rate shall be calculated to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock (or if there is not a nearest 1/10,000th of a share, to the next lower 1/10,000th of a share). No adjustment in the Settlement Rate shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent thereof; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subparagraph are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. (10) The Company may, but shall not be required to, make such increases in the Settlement Rate, in addition to those required by this Section, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reason. (11) The Company has entered into a Rights Agreement dated as of March 12, 1999 (the "RIGHTS AGREEMENT") with EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. pursuant to which share purchase rights (the "RIGHTS") have been, and may in the future be, issued in respect of shares of Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock issued upon settlement of any Purchase Contract pursuant to this Article 5 shall be entitled to receive the appropriate number of Rights, if any, and the certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such settlement shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as provided by and subject to the terms of the Rights Agreement as in effect at the time of such settlement. If after the date of this Agreement the Rights separate from the Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the Rights Agreement so that a Holder would not be entitled to receive any Rights in respect of the Common Stock issuable upon settlement of such Purchase Contract, the Settlement Rate will be adjusted as provided in this Section 5.04 on the separation date, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of the Rights. In lieu of any such adjustment, the Company may amend the Rights Agreement to provide that upon settlement Holders will receive, in addition to 55
the Common Stock issuable upon such settlement, the Rights that would have attached to such shares of Common Stock if the Rights had not become separated from the Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of the Rights Agreement. If the Company hereafter adopts any stockholder rights plan similar to the Rights Agreement, a Holder shall be entitled to receive upon settlement of its Purchase Contracts in addition to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon settlement the related rights for the Common Stock whether or not the rights under the future stockholder rights plan have separated from the Common Stock at the time of settlement but otherwise subject to the generally applicable terms of such plan and no additional adjustment to the Settlement Rate shall be made for the future stockholder rights plan under this Section 5.04. (b) Adjustment for Consolidation, Merger or Other Reorganization Event. (1) In the event of: (i) any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the continuing corporation and in which the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation are not exchanged for cash, securities or other property of the Company or another corporation); (ii) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of the property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety; (iii) any statutory share exchange of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition); or (iv) any liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Company other than as a result of or after the occurrence of a Termination Event (any event described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), a "REORGANIZATION EVENT"), each Purchase Contract shall become, without the consent of the Holder of the Unit representing such Purchase Contract, an agreement to purchase only the kind of securities, cash and other property receivable upon consummation of such Reorganization Event by a holder of Common Stock immediately prior to the closing date of such Reorganization Event. The amount of such securities, cash and other property receivable upon settlement of each such Purchase Contract after the consummation of the Reorganization Event shall be based on the value as of such settlement date of the hypothetical amount of securities, cash and other property that would have been received upon consummation of the Reorganization Event in exchange for the maximum number of Common Stock deliverable under a Purchase Contract immediately prior to the closing date of the Reorganization Event (collectively, the "EXCHANGE PROPERTY"). In determining the kind and amount of the Exchange Property pursuant to the foregoing, it will be assumed that such holder of Common Stock is not a Person with which the Company consolidated or into which the Company merged or which merged into the Company or to which 56
such sale or transfer was made, as the case may be (any such Person, a "CONSTITUENT PERSON"), or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Reorganization Event provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-affiliates and such Holder failed to exercise its rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event is not the same for each share of Common Stock held immediately prior to such Reorganization Event by other than a Constituent Person or an Affiliate thereof and in respect of which such rights of election shall not have been exercised ("NON-ELECTING SHARE"), then for the purpose of this Section the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Reorganization Event by each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). The actual amount of Exchange Property receivable upon settlement of each Purchase Contract shall be (1) in the case of settlement on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or pursuant to Section 5.04(b)(2), a variable amount based upon the applicable Settlement Rate and the Adjusted Applicable Market Value of the Exchange Property at such time and (2) in the case of any Early Settlement, determined in accordance with the procedures described under Section 5.07 using the Settlement Rate that results in the minimum amount of Exchange Property being delivered under such Purchase Contract. For purposes of this Section 5.04(b)(1) and Section 5.04(b)(2), the term "Adjusted Applicable Market Value" shall be deemed to refer to the "Adjusted Applicable Market Value" of the Exchange Property, and such value shall be determined (A) with respect to any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the Closing Price of such securities, (B) in the case of any cash that comprises all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the amount of such cash and (C) in the case of any other property that comprises all or part of the Exchange Property, based on the value of such property, as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for this purpose; provided that prior to the separation of the Rights or any similar stockholder rights from the Common Stock, such Rights or similar stockholder rights shall be deemed to have no value. The term "Closing Price" shall be deemed to refer to the closing sale price, last quoted bid price or mid-point of the last bid and ask prices, as the case may be, of any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property. The term "Trading Day" shall be deemed to refer to any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property. In the event of such a Reorganization Event, the Person formed by such consolidation, merger or exchange or the Person which acquires the assets of the Company or, in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Company, the Company or a liquidating trust created in connection therewith, shall execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent an agreement supplemental hereto providing that each Holder of an Outstanding Unit shall have the rights provided by this Section 5.04(b). Such supplemental agreement shall provide for adjustments which, for events subsequent to the effective date of such supplemental agreement, shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 57
5.04. The above provisions of this Section 5.04 shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events. (2) In the event of a consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another Person or any merger of another Person into the Company (other than a merger that does not result in any reclassification, conversion, exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of Common Stock), in each case in which 30% or more of the total consideration paid to the Company's shareholders consists of cash or cash equivalents (a "CASH MERGER"), a Holder of a Unit may settle ("CASH MERGER EARLY SETTLEMENT") the Purchase Contract represented by such Unit, upon the conditions set forth below, at the Settlement Rate in effect immediately prior to the closing of the Cash Merger; provided that (i) the Cash Merger Early Settlement Date (as defined below) is no later than the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date and (ii) no Cash Merger Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(2) unless, at the time such Cash Merger Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Cash Merger Early Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) have in effect a Registration Statement covering any securities to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (B) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Cash Merger Early Settlement. If a Holder effects a Cash Merger Early Settlement of some or all of its Purchase Contracts, such Holder shall be entitled to receive, on the Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, the aggregate amount of any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments and any Accrued and Unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments since the immediately preceding Payment Date with respect to such Purchase Contracts. The Company shall pay such amount as a credit against the amount otherwise payable by the Holders to effect such Cash Merger Early Settlement. Within five Business Days of the completion of a Cash Merger, the Company shall provide written notice to Holders of Units of such completion of a Cash Merger, which shall specify the deadline for submitting the notice to settle early in cash pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(2), the date on which such Cash Merger Early Settlement shall occur (which date shall be 10 days after the date of such written notice by the Company, but which shall in no event be later than the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date) (the "CASH MERGER EARLY SETTLEMENT DATE"), the applicable Settlement Rate and the amount (per share of Common Stock) of cash, securities and other consideration receivable by the Holder upon settlement, including the amount of Contract Adjustment Payments receivable upon settlement. Corporate Units Holders and Treasury Units Holders may only effect Cash Merger Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(2) in integral multiples of 40 Corporate Units or Treasury Units, as the case may be. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, Corporate Units Holders may only effect Cash Merger Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(2) in multiples of 64,000 Corporate Units. Other than the provisions relating to timing of notice and settlement, which shall be as set forth above, 58
the provisions of Section 5.01(a) shall apply with respect to a Cash Merger Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.04(b)(2). In order to exercise the right to effect Cash Merger Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing Units shall deliver, no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the third Business Day immediately preceding the Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, such Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount equal to the product of (A) the Stated Amount times (B) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Cash Merger Early Settlement, less the amount of any Contract Adjustment Payments payable to the Holder on the Cash Merger Early Settlement Date. If a Holder properly effects an effective Cash Merger Early Settlement in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.04(b)(2), the Company will deliver (or will cause the Collateral Agent to deliver) to the Holder on the Cash Merger Early Settlement Date: (i) the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Cash Merger by a Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on account of each Purchase Contract if the Purchase Contract Settlement Date had occurred immediately prior to such Cash Merger (based on the Settlement Rate in effect at such time), assuming such Holder of Common Stock is not a Constituent Person or an Affiliate of a Constituent Person to the extent such Cash Merger provides for different treatment of Common Stock held by Affiliates of the Company and non-affiliates and such Holder failed to exercise its rights of election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Cash Merger (provided that if the kind or amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Cash Merger is not the same for each non-electing share, then for the purpose of this Section 5.04(b)(2), the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon such Cash Merger by each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of determining the Adjusted Applicable Market Value (in connection with determining the appropriate Settlement Rate to be applied in the foregoing sentence), the date of the closing of the Cash Merger shall be deemed to be the Purchase Contract Settlement Date; (ii) the Senior Notes, the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, related to the Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder is effecting a Cash Merger Early Settlement; and (iii) if so required under the Securities Act, a Prospectus as contemplated by this Section 5.04(b)(2). 59
(c) All calculations and determinations pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall be made by the Company or its agent and the Purchase Contract Agent shall have no responsibility with respect thereto. (d) The Corporate Units or the Treasury Units of the Holders who do not elect Cash Merger Early Settlement in accordance with the foregoing will continue to remain outstanding and be subject to settlement on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date in accordance with the terms hereof. SECTION 5.05. Notice of Adjustments and Certain Other Events. (a) Whenever the Settlement Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall within 10 Business Days following the occurrence of an event that requires an adjustment to the Settlement Rate pursuant to Section 5.04 (or if the Company is not aware of such occurrence, as soon as practicable after becoming so aware): (i) compute the adjusted Settlement Rate in accordance with Section 5.04 and prepare and transmit to the Purchase Contract Agent an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Settlement Rate, the method of calculation thereof in reasonable detail, and the facts requiring such adjustment and upon which such adjustment is based; and (ii) provide a written notice to the Holders of the Units of the occurrence of such event and a statement in reasonable detail setting forth the method by which the adjustment to the Settlement Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted Settlement Rate. (b) The Purchase Contract Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Units to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Settlement Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making the same. The Purchase Contract Agent shall be fully authorized and protected in relying on any Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.05(a)(i) and any adjustment contained therein and the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment unless and until it has received such certificate. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at the time be issued or delivered with respect to any Purchase Contract; and the Purchase Contract Agent makes no representation with respect thereto. The Purchase Contract Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Purchase Contract or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article. SECTION 5.06. Termination Event; Notice. The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation 60
of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments), if the Company shall have such obligation, and the rights and obligations of Holders to purchase Common Stock, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, prior to or on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Units shall thereafter represent solely the right to receive the Senior Notes, the Treasury Securities or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, represented by such Units, in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.04 of the Pledge Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. SECTION 5.07. Early Settlement. (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.07, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts represented by Units may be settled early ("EARLY SETTLEMENT") at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date; provided that no Early Settlement will be permitted pursuant to this Section 5.07 unless, at the time such Early Settlement is effected, there is an effective Registration Statement with respect to any securities to be issued and delivered in connection with such Early Settlement, if such a Registration Statement is required (in the view of counsel, which need not be in the form of a written opinion, for the Company) under the Securities Act. If such a Registration Statement is so required, the Company covenants and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) have in effect a Registration Statement covering any securities to be delivered in respect of the Purchase Contracts being settled and (B) provide a Prospectus in connection therewith, in each case in a form that may be used in connection with such Early Settlement. (b) In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contracts, the Holder of the Certificate evidencing Units shall deliver, at any time prior to 5:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, such Certificate to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or in blank with the form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse thereof duly completed and accompanied by payment (payable to the Company in immediately available funds) in an amount (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT AMOUNT") equal to: (i) the sum of (A) the product of (I) the Stated Amount, times (II) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (B) if such delivery is made with respect to any Purchase Contracts during the period from the close of business on any Record Date next preceding any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Adjustment Payments payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Purchase Contracts, less 61
(ii) the amount of any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to such Holder as a result of such Early Settlement. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, no payment shall be made upon Early Settlement of any Purchase Contract on account of any Contract Adjustment Payments accrued on such Purchase Contract since the immediately preceding Payment Date or on account of any dividends on the Common Stock issued upon such Early Settlement. However, a Holder effecting an Early Settlement of some or all of its Purchase Contracts shall be entitled to receive, on the date it receives the shares of Common Stock referred to in Section 5.07(d), the amount of any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments with respect to such Purchase Contracts, calculated as of the immediately preceding Payment Date. The amount of such Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments shall be credited against the amount otherwise payable by the Holder to effect such Early Settlement as set forth in clause (ii) above. If the foregoing requirements are first satisfied with respect to Purchase Contracts represented by any Units at or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on a Business Day, such day shall be the "EARLY SETTLEMENT DATE" with respect to such Units and if such requirements are first satisfied after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on a Business Day or on a day that is not a Business Day, the "EARLY SETTLEMENT DATE" with respect to such Units shall be the next succeeding Business Day. Upon the receipt of such Certificate and Early Settlement Amount from the Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent shall pay to the Company such Early Settlement Amount, the receipt of which payment the Company shall confirm in writing. The Purchase Contract Agent shall then, in accordance with Section 5.06 of the Pledge Agreement, notify the Collateral Agent that (A) such Holder has elected to effect an Early Settlement, which notice shall set forth the number of such Purchase Contracts as to which such Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, (B) the Purchase Contract Agent has received from such Holder, and paid to the Company as confirmed in writing by the Company, the related Early Settlement Amount and (C) all conditions to such Early Settlement have been satisfied. Holders of Treasury Units may only effect Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.07 in integral multiples of 40 Treasury Units. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, Corporate Units Holders may only effect Early Settlement pursuant to this Section 5.07 in integral multiples of 64,000 Corporate Units. Upon Early Settlement of the Purchase Contracts, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments since the immediately preceding Payment Date and any future Contract Adjustment Payments with respect to such Purchase Contracts shall immediately and automatically terminate. (c) Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Units, the Company shall issue, and the Holder shall be entitled to receive, 0.3501 shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract as to which Early Settlement is effected (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT RATE"). The Early Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rate is adjusted pursuant to Section 5.04. 62
(d) No later than the third Business Day after the applicable Early Settlement Date, the Company shall cause: (i) the shares of Common Stock issuable upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts to be issued and delivered, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.09; and (ii) the related Senior Notes or the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, as applicable, in the case of Corporate Units, or the related Treasury Securities, in the case of Treasury Units, to be released from the Pledge by the Collateral Agent and transferred, in each case, to the Purchase Contract Agent for delivery to the Holder thereof or its designee. (e) Upon Early Settlement of any Purchase Contracts, and subject to receipt of shares of Common Stock from the Company and the Senior Notes, the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, from the Securities Intermediary, as applicable, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, in accordance with the instructions provided by the Holder thereof on the applicable form of Election to Settle Early on the reverse of the Certificate evidencing the related Units: (i) transfer to the Holder the Senior Notes, the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio or Treasury Securities, as the case may be, represented by such Units, (ii) deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates for the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Early Settlement, together with payment in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided in Section 5.09, and (iii) if so required under the Securities Act, deliver a Prospectus for the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Early Settlement as contemplated by Section 5.07(a). (f) In the event that Early Settlement is effected with respect to Purchase Contracts represented by less than all the Units evidenced by a Certificate, upon such Early Settlement the Company shall execute and the Purchase Contract Agent shall execute on behalf of the Holder, authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a Certificate evidencing the Units as to which Early Settlement was not effected. (g) A Holder of a Unit who effects Early Settlement may elect to have the Senior Notes no longer represented by a Corporate Unit remarketed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.02. SECTION 5.08. Intentionally Omitted. SECTION 5.09. No Fractional Shares. 63
No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered upon settlement on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, or upon Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement of any Purchase Contracts. If Certificates evidencing more than one Purchase Contract shall be surrendered for settlement at one time by the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock that shall be delivered upon settlement shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of Purchase Contracts evidenced by the Certificates so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be deliverable upon settlement of any Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, or upon Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Company, through the Purchase Contract Agent, shall make a cash payment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to the percentage of such fractional share times the Applicable Market Value calculated as if the date of such settlement were the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. The Company shall provide the Purchase Contract Agent from time to time with sufficient funds to permit the Purchase Contract Agent to make all cash payments required by this Section 5.09 in a timely manner. SECTION 5.10. Charges and Taxes. The Company will pay all stock transfer and similar taxes attributable to the initial issuance and delivery of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Purchase Contracts; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any such tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any exchange of or substitution for a Certificate evidencing a Unit or any issuance of a share of Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered Holder of a Certificate surrendered in respect of the Units evidenced thereby, other than in the name of the Purchase Contract Agent, as custodian for such Holder, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such share certificates or Certificates unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the transfer or issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. SECTION 5.11. Contract Adjustment Payments. (a) Subject to Section 5.11(d) and Section 5.12, the Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name a Certificate is registered at the close of business on the Record Date relating to such Payment Date. The Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City maintained for that purpose. If the book-entry system for the Units has been terminated, the Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Security Register, or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person by a prior written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent. If any date on which Contract Adjustment Payments are to be made is not a Business Day, then payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest in respect of any such delay); provided that if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, then payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments will be made on the Business Day 64
immediately preceding such Business Day. Contract Adjustment Payments payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Contract Adjustment Payments will accrue from June 24, 2003. (b) Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company's obligation to pay future Contract Adjustment Payments (including any accrued Contract Adjustment Payments and any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments) shall cease. (c) Each Certificate delivered under this Agreement upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of (including as a result of a Collateral Substitution or the recreation of Corporate Units) any other Certificate shall carry the right to accrued and unpaid Contract Adjustment Payments and Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments, which right was carried by the Purchase Contracts represented by such other Certificates. (d) In the case of any Unit with respect to which Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Purchase Contract represented by such Unit is effected on a date that is after any Record Date and prior to or on the next succeeding Payment Date, Contract Adjustment Payments otherwise payable on such Payment Date shall be payable on such Payment Date notwithstanding such Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, and such Contract Adjustment Payments shall be paid to the Person in whose name the Certificate evidencing such Unit is registered at the close of business on such Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding sentence, in the case of any Unit with respect to which Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Purchase Contract represented by such Unit is effected, Contract Adjustment Payments that would otherwise be payable after the Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date with respect to such Purchase Contract shall not be payable. (e) The Company's obligations with respect to Contract Adjustment Payments, if any, will be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations under any Indebtedness. (f) In the event (x) of any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors upon any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings, or (y) subject to the provisions of Section 5.11(h) below, that (i) a default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the payment of principal, interest or any other monetary amounts due and payable on any Indebtedness and such default shall have continued beyond the period of grace, if any, specified in the instrument evidencing such Indebtedness (and the Purchase Contract Agent shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or one or more holders of Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any such Indebtedness may have been issued), or (ii) the maturity of any Indebtedness shall have been accelerated because of a default in respect of such Indebtedness (and the Purchase Contract Agent shall have received written notice thereof from the Company or one or more holders of 65
Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any such Indebtedness may have been issued), then: (i) the holders of all Indebtedness shall first be entitled to receive, in the case of clause (x) above, payment of all amounts due or to become due upon all Indebtedness and, in the case of subclauses (i) and (ii) of clause (y) above, payment of all amounts due thereon, or provision shall be made for such payment in money or money's worth, before the Holders of any of the Units are entitled to receive any Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts represented by the Units; (ii) any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the Holders of any of the Units would be entitled except for the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (q), shall be paid or delivered by the Person making such payment or distribution, whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver or liquidating trustee or otherwise, directly to the representative or representatives of the holders of Indebtedness or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any of such Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably according to the aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of such Indebtedness held or represented by each, to the extent necessary to make payment in full of all Indebtedness remaining unpaid after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Indebtedness, before any payment or distribution is made of such Contract Adjustment Payments to the Holders of such Units; and (iii) in the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment by, or distribution of assets of, the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, shall be received by the Purchase Contract Agent or the Holders of any of the Units when such payment or distribution is prohibited pursuant to Section 5.11(e) through (q), such payment or distribution shall be paid over to the representative or representatives of the holders of Indebtedness or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments evidencing any such Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably as aforesaid, for application to the payment of all Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all such Indebtedness shall have been paid in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution (or provision therefor) to the holders of such Indebtedness. (g) For purposes of Section 5.11(e) through (q), the words "cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other Person provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is subordinated at least to the extent provided in Section 5.11(e) through (q) with respect to such Contract Adjustment Payments on the Units to the payment of all Indebtedness which may at the time be outstanding; provided that (i) the indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness, as the case may be, that constitutes Indebtedness is assumed by the Person, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and (ii) 66
the rights of the holders of the Indebtedness are not, without the consent of each such holder adversely affected thereby, altered by such reorganization or readjustment; (h) Any failure by the Company to make any payment on or perform any other obligation under Indebtedness, other than any indebtedness incurred by the Company or assumed or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by the Company for money borrowed (or any deferral, renewal, extension or refunding thereof) or any indebtedness or obligation as to which the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (g) shall have been waived by the Company in the instrument or instruments by which the Company incurred, assumed, guaranteed or otherwise created such indebtedness or obligation, shall not be deemed a default or event of default if (i) the Company shall be disputing its obligation to make such payment or perform such obligation and (ii) either (A) no final judgment relating to such dispute shall have been issued against the Company which is in full force and effect and is not subject to further review, including a judgment that has become final by reason of the expiration of the time within which a party may seek further appeal or review, and (B) in the event a judgment that is subject to further review or appeal has been issued, the Company shall in good faith be prosecuting an appeal or other proceeding for review and a stay of execution shall have been obtained pending such appeal or review. (i) Subject to the irrevocable payment in full of all Indebtedness, the Holders of the Units shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of all obligations of the Company which by their express terms are subordinated to Indebtedness of the Company to the same extent as payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments in respect of the Purchase Contracts represented by the Units is subordinated and which are entitled to like rights of subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company applicable to the Indebtedness until all such Contract Adjustment Payments owing on the Units shall be paid in full, and as between the Company, its claimholders other than holders of such Indebtedness and the Holders, no such payment or distribution made to the holders of Indebtedness by virtue of Section 5.11(e) through (q) that otherwise would have been made to the Holders shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company on account of such Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (q) are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of Indebtedness, on the other hand. (j) Nothing contained in Section 5.11(e) through (q) or elsewhere in this Agreement or in the Units is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its claimholders other than the holders of Indebtedness and the Holders, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders such Contract Adjustment Payments on the Units as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders and claimholders of the Company other than the holders of Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Purchase Contract Agent or any Holder from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Agreement, subject to the rights, if any, under Section 5.11(e) through (q), of the holders of Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such remedy. 67
(k) Upon payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in Section 5.11(e) through (q), the Purchase Contract Agent and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which any such dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceeding affecting the affairs of the Company is pending or upon a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidating trustee or Purchase Contract Agent or other person making any payment or distribution, delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent or to the Holders, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to these Section 5.11(e) through (q). (l) The Purchase Contract Agent shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself to be a holder of Indebtedness (or a trustee or representative on behalf of such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Indebtedness or a trustee or representative on behalf of any such holder or holders. In the event that the Purchase Contract Agent determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to Section 5.11(e) through (q), the Purchase Contract Agent may request such Person to furnish evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Purchase Contract Agent as to the amount of Indebtedness held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under Section 5.11(e) through (q), and, if such evidence is not furnished, the Purchase Contract Agent may defer payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment. (m) Nothing contained in Section 5.11(e) through (q) shall affect the obligations of the Company to make, or prevent the Company from making, payment of the Contract Adjustment Payments, except as otherwise provided in these Section 5.11(e) through (q). (n) Each Holder of Units, by its acceptance thereof, authorizes and directs the Purchase Contract Agent on its behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination provided in Section 5.11 (e) through (q) and appoints the Purchase Contract Agent its attorney-in-fact, as the case may be, for any and all such purposes. (o) The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent of any fact known to the Company that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Purchase Contract Agent in respect of the Units pursuant to the provisions of this Section. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.11(e) through (q) or any other provisions of this Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to or by the Purchase Contract Agent, or the taking of any other action by the Purchase Contract Agent, unless and until the Purchase Contract Agent shall have received written notice thereof mailed or delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent from the Company, any Holder, or the holder or representative of 68
any Indebtedness; provided that if at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any such moneys may become payable for any purpose, the Purchase Contract Agent shall not have received with respect to such moneys the notice provided for in this Section, then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Purchase Contract Agent shall have full power and authority to receive such moneys and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary that may be received by it within two Business Days prior to or on or after such date. (p) The Purchase Contract Agent in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Section with respect to any Indebtedness at the time held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Indebtedness and nothing in this Agreement shall deprive the Purchase Contract Agent of any of its rights as such holder. (q) No right of any present or future holder of any Indebtedness to enforce the subordination herein shall at any time or in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or be otherwise charged with. (r) Nothing in this Section 5.11 shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Purchase Contract Agent under or pursuant to Section 7.07. (s) With respect to the holders of Indebtedness, (i) the duties and obligations of the Purchase Contract Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement; (ii) the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall, acting in good faith, mistakenly pay over or distribute to the Holders or to the Company or any other Person cash, property or securities to which any holders of Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of this Section 5.11 or otherwise; (iii) no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Purchase Contract Agent; and (iv) the Purchase Contract Agent shall not be deemed to be a fiduciary as to such holders. SECTION 5.12. Deferral of Contract Adjustment Payments. (a) The Company has the right to defer payment of all or part of the Contract Adjustment Payments in respect of each Purchase Contract until no later than the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (or, in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be), but only if the Company shall give the Holders and the Purchase Contract Agent written notice of its election to defer such payment (specifying the amount to be deferred) at least ten Business Days prior to the earlier of (i) the next succeeding Payment Date or (ii) the date the Company is required to give notice of the Record Date or Payment Date with respect to payment of such Contract Adjustment Payments to the NYSE or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to Holders, but in any event not less than one Business Day prior to such Record Date. If the Company so elects to defer Contract Adjustment Payments, the Company shall pay additional Contract Adjustment Payments on such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment 69
Payments at a rate equal to 7.00% per annum, compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until such deferred installments are paid in full (such deferred installments of Contract Adjustment Payments together with the accrued additional Contract Adjustment Payments thereon, being referred to herein as the "DEFERRED CONTRACT ADJUSTMENT PAYMENTS"). Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments shall be due on the next succeeding Payment Date except to the extent that payment is deferred pursuant to this Section. (b) In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (or, in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be), each Holder will receive on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as applicable, the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments to the extent such amounts are not deducted from the Stated Amount in the case of a Cash Settlement, any Early Settlement or any Cash Merger Early Settlement. The Company shall pay such amount on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (or, in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be) in the manner described in Section 5.11(a). (c) In the event the Company exercises its option to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments, then, until all Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments have been paid, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to, declare or pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock or their capital stock; provided that the Company's subsidiaries will not be restricted from declaring or paying such dividends, or making such distributions, to the Company or any of the Company's other subsidiaries as a result of the foregoing.

SECTION 6.03. Rights and Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificates in the last paragraph of Section 3.10, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy. SECTION 6.04. Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of any Holder to exercise any right upon a default or remedy upon a default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such right. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by such Holders. SECTION 6.05. Undertaking for Costs. All parties to this Agreement agree, and each Holder of a Unit, by its acceptance of such Unit shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Agreement, or in any suit against the Purchase Contract Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Purchase Contract Agent, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; provided that the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Purchase Contract Agent, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% of the Outstanding Units, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of interest on any Senior Notes or Contract Adjustment Payments on or after the respective Payment Date therefor in respect of any Unit held by such Holder, or for enforcement of the right to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Purchase Contracts represented by any Unit held by such Holder. 71

Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on August 16, 2006 (the "PURCHASE CONTRACT SETTLEMENT DATE"), at a price equal to $25.00 (the "STATED AMOUNT"), a number of newly issued shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("COMMON STOCK"), of the Company, equal to the Settlement Rate, unless on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date there shall have occurred a Termination Event or an Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement with respect to such Purchase Contract.

The "APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means the average of the Closing Price per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date subject to adjustments set forth under Section 5.04 of the Purchase Contract Agreement. The "ADJUSTED APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means (i) prior to any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Applicable Market Value, and (ii) at the time of and after any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Applicable Market Value multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the denominator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that if such adjustment to the Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Settlement Rate.

In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate may pay the Stated Amount for the shares of Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or, if applicable, a Cash Merger Early Settlement or from the proceeds of the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio or a Remarketing of the related Pledged Senior Notes. Unless the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by Corporate Units, a Holder of Corporate Units who (1) does not, on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, notify the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement, or who does so notify the Purchase Contract Agent but fails to make an effective Cash Settlement prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, or (2) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, does not make an effective Early Settlement, shall pay the Stated Amount for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds of the sale of the related Pledged Senior Notes held by the Collateral Agent unless the Holder has previously made a Cash Merger Early Settlement. Unless the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by Corporate Units, such sale will be made by the Remarketing Agent pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement on the Final Remarketing Date. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by Corporate Units, a Holder of Corporate Units who does not notify the Purchase Contract Agent, on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement shall pay the Stated Amount for the shares of Common Stock to be delivered under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds at maturity of the Applicable Ownership Interests (as defined in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio. If, as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, upon the occurrence of a Failed Final Remarketing, the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Company, exercises its rights as a secured creditor with respect to the Pledged Senior Notes related to this Corporate Units Certificate, any accrued and unpaid interest on such Pledged Senior Notes shall become payable by the Company to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Beneficial Owner of the Corporate Units to which such Senior Notes relate. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received A-9
payment of the aggregate Stated Amount for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holder hereunder shall terminate if a Termination Event shall occur. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent and to the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Pledged Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio represented by each Corporate Unit from the Pledge. A Corporate Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Senior Note or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio represented by such Corporate Units in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Under the terms of the Pledge Agreement and the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Purchase Contract Agent will be entitled to exercise the voting and any other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Senior Notes, but only to the extent instructed in writing by the Holders. Upon receipt of notice of any meeting at which holders of Senior Notes are entitled to vote or upon the solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of Senior Notes, the Purchase Contract Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, mail to the Corporate Units Holders a notice: (1) containing such information as is contained in the notice or solicitation; (2) stating that each Corporate Units Holder on the record date set by the Purchase Contract Agent therefor (which, to the extent possible, shall be the same date as the record date for determining the holders of Senior Notes entitled to vote) shall be entitled to instruct the Purchase Contract Agent as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the Senior Notes represented by such Holder's Corporate Units; and (3) stating the manner in which such instructions may be given. Upon the written request of the Corporate Units Holders on such record date, received by the Purchase Contract Agent at least six days prior to such meeting, the Purchase Contract Agent shall endeavor insofar as practicable to vote or cause to be voted, in accordance with the instructions set forth in such requests, the maximum aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes as to which any particular voting instructions are received. In the absence of specific instructions from the Holder of a Corporate Unit, the Purchase Contract Agent shall abstain from voting the Senior Note evidenced by such Corporate Unit. Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption, the Collateral Agent shall surrender the Pledged Senior Notes against delivery of an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Price A-10
of the Pledged Senior Notes and shall deposit funds in the Collateral Account in exchange for the Pledged Senior Notes. Thereafter, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent shall cause the Securities Intermediary to apply an amount equal to the aggregate Redemption Amount of such funds to purchase on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units, the Treasury Portfolio, and promptly (a) transfer the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio to the Collateral Account to secure the obligations of each Holder of Corporate Units to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Purchase Contracts represented by such Corporate Units, (b) transfer the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (ii) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio to the Purchase Contract Agent for the benefit of the Holders of such Corporate Units and (C) remit the remaining portion of such funds to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of such Corporate Units. Upon the occurrence of a Successful Remarketing of Senior Notes prior to the Final Remarketing Date, pursuant to the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, the Remarketing Agent will apply an amount equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price to purchase on behalf of the Holders of Corporate Units, the Treasury Portfolio, and, after deducting the Remarketing Fee to the extent permitted under the terms of the Remarketing Agreement, promptly remit the remaining portion of such proceeds of such Successful Remarketing to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of such Corporate Units. Following the occurrence of (i) a Special Event Redemption prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, or (ii) a Successful Remarketing of the Senior Notes prior to the Final Remarketing Date, the Holders of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent shall have such security interest rights and obligations with respect to the Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio as the Holder of Corporate Units and the Collateral Agent had in respect of the Senior Notes, as the case may be, subject to the Pledge thereof as provided in the Pledge Agreement and any reference herein to the Senior Notes shall be deemed to be a reference to such Treasury Portfolio. The Corporate Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Corporate Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Corporate Units Certificate will be registered and Corporate Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. A Holder who elects to substitute a Treasury Security for a Senior Note, thereby creating Treasury Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses payable in connection therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Purchase Contract represented by a Corporate Units remains in effect, such Corporate Units shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Corporate Units in A-11
respect of the Senior Notes and Purchase Contract represented by such Corporate Units may be transferred and exchanged only as a Corporate Unit. Unless the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of Corporate Units may substitute, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, for the Pledged Senior Notes securing such Holder's obligations under the related Purchase Contracts, Treasury Securities in an aggregate principal amount at maturity equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Pledged Senior Notes in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such Collateral Substitution, each Unit for which such Pledged Treasury Securities secures the Holder's obligation under the Purchase Contract shall be referred to as a "TREASURY UNIT". A Holder may make such Collateral Substitution only in integral multiples of 40 Corporate Units for 40 Treasury Units. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, a Holder may, at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, substitute Treasury Securities for the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio, but only in integral multiples of 64,000 Corporate Units. In such an event, the Holder shall transfer Treasury Securities to the Collateral Agent, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledge of and transfer to the Holder the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio. The Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Corporate Units Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in New York City. If the book-entry system for the Corporate Units has been terminated, the Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such Person's address as it appears on the Security Register, or by wire transfer to the account designated by such Person by a prior written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent. The Company has the right to defer payment of all or part of the Contract Adjustment Payments in respect of each Purchase Contract until no later than the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (or in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be). If the Company so elects to defer Contract Adjustment Payments, the Company shall pay additional Contract Adjustment Payments on such deferred installments of Purchase Contract Payments at a rate equal to 7.00% per annum, compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until such deferred installments are paid. In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (or, in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early A-12
Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be), each Holder will receive on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as applicable, the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments to the extent such fees are not deducted from the Stated Amount in the case of a Cash Settlement or any Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement. The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter, give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Senior Notes or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, from the Pledge in accordance with the provisions of the Pledge Agreement. Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts represented by Units may be settled early at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date ("EARLY SETTLEMENT") as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contract evidenced by this Certificate, the Holder of this Corporate Units Certificate shall deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office an Election to Settle Early form set forth below duly completed and accompanied by payment in the form of immediately available funds payable to the order of the Company in an amount (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT AMOUNT") equal to: (i) the sum of (A) the product of (I) the Stated Amount, times (II) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (B) if such delivery is made with respect to any Purchase Contracts during the period from the close of business on any Record Date next preceding any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Adjustment Payments payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Purchase Contracts, less (ii) the amount of any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to such Holder as a result of such Early Settlement. Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Units, the Pledged Senior Notes or Pledge Applicable Ownership Interests (as specified in clause (i) of the A-13
definition of such term) represented by such Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract represented by a Corporate Unit as to which Early Settlement is effected equal to 0.3501 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT RATE"). The Early Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rate is adjusted as provided in Section 5.04 of the Purchase Contract Agreement.

(REVERSE OF TREASURY UNIT CERTIFICATE) Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of June 24, 2003 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "PURCHASE CONTRACT AGREEMENT") between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "PURCHASE CONTRACT AGENT"), to which the Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Treasury Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Treasury Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on August 16, 2006 (the "PURCHASE CONTRACT SETTLEMENT DATE"), at a price equal to $25.00 (the "STATED AMOUNT"), a number of newly issued shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("COMMON STOCK"), of the Company, equal to the Settlement Rate, unless on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date there shall have occurred a Termination Event or an Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement with respect to such Purchase Contract. The "SETTLEMENT RATE" is equal to: (1) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is greater than $71.40 (the "THRESHOLD APPRECIATION PRICE"), 0.3501 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract; (2) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value is less than or equal to the Threshold Appreciation Price but greater than or equal to $59.50 (the "REFERENCE PRICE"), the number of shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract having a value equal to the Stated Amount divided by the Adjusted Applicable Market Value; and (3) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value is less than the Reference Price, 0.4202 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract; in each case subject to adjustment as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement (and in each case rounded upward or downward to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share). No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in Section 5.09 of the Purchase Contract Agreement. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby, which is settled through Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement shall obligate the Holder of the related Treasury Units to purchase at the Stated Amount, and the Company to sell, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Early Settlement Rate (in the case of an Early Settlement) or applicable Settlement Rate (in the case of a Cash Merger Early Settlement). B-6
The "APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means the average of the Closing Prices per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, subject to adjustments set forth under Section 5.04 hereof. The "ADJUSTED APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means (i) prior to any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Applicable Market Value, and (ii) at the time of and after any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Applicable Market Value multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the denominator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that if such adjustment to the Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Settlement Rate. The "CLOSING PRICE" per share of Common Stock on any date of determination means the: (1) closing sale price as of the close of the principal trading session (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) per share on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") on such date; (2) if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, the closing sale price (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) per share as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States national or regional securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed; (3) if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, the last reported sale price per share as reported by The Nasdaq National Market, Inc.; (4) if the Common Stock is not so reported by the Nasdaq National Market, Inc. the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization; or (5) if such bid price, referred to in clause (4), is not available, the market value of the Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company. B-7
A "TRADING DAY" means a day on which the Common Stock (1) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (2) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Treasury Unit shall pay the Stated Amount for the shares of the Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby either by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or, if applicable, a Cash Merger Early Settlement of each such Purchase Contract or by applying a principal amount of the Pledged Treasury Securities represented by such Holder's Treasury Unit equal to the Stated Amount of such Purchase Contract to the purchase of the Common Stock. A Holder of Treasury Units who (1) does not on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, notify the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement, or who does so notify the Purchase Contract Agent but fails to make an effective Cash Settlement prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, (2) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, does not make an effective Early Settlement, or (3) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, does not make an effective Cash Merger Early Settlement, shall pay the Stated Amount for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds of the Pledged Treasury Securities. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment of the aggregate Stated Amount for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Company has the right to defer payment of all or part of the Contract Adjustment Payments in respect of each Purchase Contract until no later than the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (or in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be). If the Company so elects to defer Contract Adjustment Payments, the Company shall pay additional Contract Adjustment Payments on such deferred installments of Purchase Contract Payments at a rate equal to 7.00% per annum, compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until such deferred installments are paid. In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (or, in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement, as the case may be), each Holder will receive on B-8
the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or Early Settlement Date, as applicable, the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments to the extent such fees are not deducted from the Stated Amount in the case of a Cash Settlement or any Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement. The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter, give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Pledged Treasury Securities (as defined in the Pledge Agreement) represented by each Treasury Unit. A Treasury Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Proceeds of the Treasury Security represented by such Treasury Unit, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. The Treasury Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Treasury Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Treasury Units Certificate will be registered and Treasury Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. A Holder who elects to substitute Senior Notes for Treasury Securities, thereby recreating Corporate Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses associated therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Purchase Contract represented by a Treasury Unit remains in effect, such Treasury Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Treasury Unit in respect of the Treasury Security and the Purchase Contract represented by such Treasury Unit may be transferred and exchanged only as a Treasury Unit. Unless the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement, a Holder of Treasury Units may recreate, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Corporate Units by delivering to the Securities Intermediary Senior Notes with an aggregate principal amount, equal to the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Pledged Treasury Securities in exchange for the release of such Pledged Treasury Securities in accordance with the terms of the Purchase B-9
Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such substitution, the Holder's Units shall be referred to as a "CORPORATE UNIT". Any such creation of Corporate Units may be effected only in multiples of 40 Treasury Units for 40 Corporate Units. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, a Holder may at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date substitute the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio for Treasury Securities, but only in integral multiples of 64,000 Treasury Units. In such event, the Holder shall transfer to the Collateral Agent the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio in an amount such that the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the portion of such Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) is equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of the Purchase Contracts underlying such Treasury Units, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledge of and transfer to the Holder the Treasury Securities. The Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Treasury Units Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in New York City or, at the option of the Holder, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the Security Register. The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Treasury Securities from the Pledge in accordance with the provisions of the Pledge Agreement. A Treasury Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the interest in the Treasury Security represented by such Treasury Unit, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts represented by Units may be settled early ("EARLY SETTLEMENT") as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contract evidenced by this Certificate, the Holder of this Treasury Units Certificate shall deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office an Election to Settle Early form set forth below duly B-10
completed and accompanied by payment in the form of immediately available funds payable to the order of the Company in an amount (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT AMOUNT") equal to: (i) the sum of (A) the product of (I) the Stated Amount, times (II) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (B) if such delivery is made with respect to any Purchase Contracts during the period from the close of business on any Record Date next preceding any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Adjustment Payments payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Purchase Contracts, less (ii) the amount of any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to such Holder as a result of such Early Settlement. Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Units, the Pledged Treasury Securities represented by such Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract represented by a Treasury Unit as to which Early Settlement is effected equal to 0.3501 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT RATE"). The Early Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rate is adjusted as provided in Section 5.04 of the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Cash Merger, a Holder of Treasury Units may effect Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Purchase Contract represented by such Treasury Units pursuant to the terms of Section 5.04(b)(2) of the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon Cash Merger Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Treasury Units, the Pledged Treasury Securities represented by such Treasury Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Pledge Agreement. Upon registration of transfer of this Treasury Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Treasury Units Certificate. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. The Holder of this Treasury Units Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contracts represented by the Treasury Units evidenced hereby on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) of the Purchase Contracts by the Company or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, B-11

The Holder further covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, payments in respect to the aggregate principal amount of the Pledged Treasury Securities on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments. Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority of the Outstanding Units. The Purchase Contracts shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. Prior to due presentment of this Certificate for registration or transfer, the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and its Affiliates and any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent may treat the Person in whose name this Treasury Units Certificate is registered as the owner of the Treasury Units evidenced hereby for the purpose of receiving payments of interest on the Treasury Securities, receiving payments of Contract Adjustment Payments (subject to any applicable record date), performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Purchase Contracts shall not, prior to the settlement thereof, entitle the Holder to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock. A copy of the Purchase Contract Agreement is available for inspection at the offices of the Purchase Contract Agent. B-12

(REVERSE OF TREASURY UNIT CERTIFICATE) Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby is governed by a Purchase Contract Agreement, dated as of June 24, 2003 (as may be supplemented from time to time, the "PURCHASE CONTRACT AGREEMENT") between the Company and Bank One Trust Company, N.A., as Purchase Contract Agent (including its successors thereunder, herein called the "PURCHASE CONTRACT AGENT"), to which the Purchase Contract Agreement and supplemental agreements thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Purchase Contract Agent, the Company and the Holders and of the terms upon which the Treasury Units Certificates are, and are to be, executed and delivered. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby obligates the Holder of this Treasury Units Certificate to purchase, and the Company to sell, on August 16, 2006 (the "PURCHASE CONTRACT SETTLEMENT DATE"), at a price equal to $25.00 (the "STATED AMOUNT"), a number of newly issued shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("COMMON STOCK"), of the Company, equal to the Settlement Rate, unless on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date there shall have occurred a Termination Event or an Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement with respect to such Purchase Contract. The "SETTLEMENT RATE" is equal to: (1) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value (as defined below) is greater than $71.40 (the "THRESHOLD APPRECIATION PRICE"), 0.3501 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract; (2) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value is less than or equal to the Threshold Appreciation Price but greater than or equal to $59.50 (the "REFERENCE PRICE"), the number of shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract having a value equal to the Stated Amount divided by the Adjusted Applicable Market Value; and (3) if the Adjusted Applicable Market Value is less than the Reference Price, 0.4202 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract; in each case subject to adjustment as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement (and in each case rounded upward or downward to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share). No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon settlement of Purchase Contracts, as provided in Section 5.09 of the Purchase Contract Agreement. Each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby, which is settled through Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement shall obligate the Holder of the related Treasury Units to purchase at the Stated Amount, and the Company to sell, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock equal to the Early Settlement Rate (in the case of an Early Settlement) or applicable Settlement Rate (in the case of a Cash Merger Early Settlement). C-6
The "APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means the average of the Closing Prices per share of Common Stock on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days ending on the third Trading Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, subject to adjustments set forth under Section 5.04 hereof. The "ADJUSTED APPLICABLE MARKET VALUE" means (i) prior to any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Applicable Market Value, and (ii) at the time of and after any adjustment of the Settlement Rate pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Applicable Market Value multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately after such adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the denominator of which shall be the Settlement Rate immediately prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that if such adjustment to the Settlement Rate is required to be made pursuant to the occurrence of any of the events contemplated by paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (10) of Section 5.04(a) of the Purchase Contract Agreement during the period taken into consideration for determining the Applicable Market Value, appropriate and customary adjustments shall be made to the Settlement Rate. The "CLOSING PRICE" per share of Common Stock on any date of determination means the: (1) closing sale price as of the close of the principal trading session (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) per share on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") on such date; (2) if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NYSE on any such date, the closing sale price (or, if no closing price is reported, the last reported sale price) per share as reported in the composite transactions for the principal United States national or regional securities exchange on which the Common Stock is so listed; (3) if the Common Stock is not so listed on a United States national or regional securities exchange, the last reported sale price per share as reported by The Nasdaq National Market, Inc.; (4) if the Common Stock is not so reported by the Nasdaq National Market, Inc., the last quoted bid price for the Common Stock in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or similar organization; or (5) if such bid price, referred to in clause (4), is not available, the market value of the Common Stock on such date as determined by a nationally recognized independent investment banking firm retained for this purpose by the Company. C-7
A "TRADING DAY" means a day on which the Common Stock (1) is not suspended from trading on any national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market at the close of business and (2) has traded at least once on the national or regional securities exchange or association or over-the-counter market that is the primary market for the trading of the Common Stock. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement, the Holder of this Treasury Unit shall pay the Stated Amount for the shares of the Common Stock purchased pursuant to each Purchase Contract evidenced hereby either by effecting a Cash Settlement, an Early Settlement or, if applicable, a Cash Merger Early Settlement of each such Purchase Contract or by applying a principal amount of the Pledged Treasury Securities represented by such Holder's Treasury Unit equal to the Stated Amount of such Purchase Contract to the purchase of the Common Stock. A Holder of Treasury Units who (1) does not on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, notify the Purchase Contract Agent of its intention to effect a Cash Settlement, or who does so notify the Purchase Contract Agent but fails to make an effective Cash Settlement prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fourth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, (2) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, does not make an effective Early Settlement, or (3) on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, does not make an effective Cash Merger Early Settlement, shall pay the Stated Amount for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under the related Purchase Contract from the proceeds of the Pledged Treasury Securities. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock in respect of a Purchase Contract or deliver any certificates therefor to the Holder unless it shall have received payment of the aggregate Stated Amount for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased thereunder in the manner set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Company has the right to defer payment of all or part of the Contract Adjustment Payments in respect of each Purchase Contract until no later than the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (or in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement Date, as the case may be). If the Company so elects to defer Contract Adjustment Payments, the Company shall pay additional Contract Adjustment Payments on such deferred installments of Purchase Contract Payments at a rate equal to 7.00% per annum, compounding on each succeeding Payment Date, until such deferred installments are paid. In the event that the Company elects to defer the payment of Contract Adjustment Payments on the Purchase Contracts until the Purchase Contract Settlement Date (or, in the event of an effective Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement, the Early Settlement Date or Cash Merger Early Settlement, as the case may be), each Holder will receive on C-8
the Purchase Contract Settlement Date or Early Settlement Date, as applicable, the aggregate amount of Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments to the extent such fees are not deducted from the Stated Amount in the case of a Cash Settlement or any Early Settlement or Cash Merger Early Settlement. The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter, give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Pledged Treasury Securities (as defined in the Pledge Agreement) represented by each Treasury Unit. A Treasury Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Proceeds of the Treasury Security represented by such Treasury Unit, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. The Treasury Units Certificates are issuable only in registered form and only in denominations of a single Treasury Unit and any integral multiple thereof. The transfer of any Treasury Units Certificate will be registered and Treasury Units Certificates may be exchanged as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. The Security Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents permitted by the Purchase Contract Agreement. No service charge shall be required for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company and the Purchase Contract Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith. A Holder who elects to substitute Senior Notes for Treasury Securities, thereby recreating Corporate Units, shall be responsible for any fees or expenses associated therewith. Except as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement, for so long as the Purchase Contract represented by a Treasury Unit remains in effect, such Treasury Unit shall not be separable into its constituent parts, and the rights and obligations of the Holder of such Treasury Unit in respect of the Treasury Security and the Purchase Contract represented by such Treasury Unit may be transferred and exchanged only as a Treasury Unit. Unless the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Contract Agreement, a Holder of Treasury Units may recreate, at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, Corporate Units by delivering to the Securities Intermediary Senior Notes with an aggregate principal amount, equal to the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Pledged Treasury Securities in exchange for the release of such Pledged Treasury Securities in accordance with the terms of the Purchase C-9
Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. From and after such substitution, the Holder's Units shall be referred to as a "CORPORATE UNIT". Any such creation of Corporate Units may be effected only in multiples of 40 Treasury Units for 40 Corporate Units. If the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by the Corporate Units, a Holder may at any time on or prior to the second Business Day immediately preceding the Purchase Contract Settlement Date substitute the Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio for Treasury Securities, but only in integral multiples of 64,000 Treasury Units. In such event, the Holder shall transfer to the Collateral Agent the Applicable Ownership Interest in the Treasury Portfolio in an amount such that the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the portion of such Applicable Ownership Interests in the Treasury Portfolio (as specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term) is equal to the aggregate Stated Amount of the Purchase Contracts underlying such Treasury Units, and the Purchase Contract Agent shall instruct the Collateral Agent to release the Pledge of and transfer to the Holder the Treasury Securities. The Company shall pay, on each Payment Date, the Contract Adjustment Payments payable in respect of each Purchase Contract to the Person in whose name the Treasury Units Certificate evidencing such Purchase Contract is registered at the close of business on the Record Date for such Payment Date. Contract Adjustment Payments will be payable at the office of the Purchase Contract Agent in New York City or, at the option of the Holder, by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto at such address as it appears on the Security Register. The Purchase Contracts and all obligations and rights of the Company and the Holders thereunder, including, without limitation, the rights of the Holders to receive and the obligation of the Company to pay any Contract Adjustment Payments, shall immediately and automatically terminate, without the necessity of any notice or action by any Holder, the Purchase Contract Agent or the Company, if, on or prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, a Termination Event shall have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Company shall promptly but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter give written notice to the Purchase Contract Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Holders, at their addresses as they appear in the Security Register. Upon and after the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Collateral Agent shall release the Treasury Securities from the Pledge in accordance with the provisions of the Pledge Agreement. A Treasury Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive the interest in the Treasury Security represented by such Treasury Unit, in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement. Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement, at the option of the Holder thereof, Purchase Contracts represented by Units may be settled early ("EARLY SETTLEMENT") as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement. In order to exercise the right to effect Early Settlement with respect to any Purchase Contract evidenced by this Certificate, the Holder of this Treasury Units Certificate shall deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent at the Corporate Trust Office an Election to Settle Early form set forth below duly C-10
completed and accompanied by payment in the form of immediately available funds payable to the order of the Company in an amount (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT AMOUNT") equal to: (i) the sum of (A) the product of (I) the Stated Amount, times (II) the number of Purchase Contracts with respect to which the Holder has elected to effect Early Settlement, plus (B) if such delivery is made with respect to any Purchase Contracts during the period from the close of business on any Record Date next preceding any Payment Date to the opening of business on such Payment Date, an amount equal to the Contract Adjustment Payments payable on such Payment Date with respect to such Purchase Contracts, less (ii) the amount of any Deferred Contract Adjustment Payments payable to such Holder as a result of such Early Settlement. Upon Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Units, the Pledged Treasury Securities represented by such Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Pledge Agreement and the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock on account of each Purchase Contract represented by a Treasury Unit as to which Early Settlement is effected equal to 0.3501 shares of Common Stock per Purchase Contract (the "EARLY SETTLEMENT RATE"). The Early Settlement Rate shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the Settlement Rate is adjusted as provided in Section 5.04 of the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon the occurrence of a Cash Merger, a Holder of Treasury Units may effect Cash Merger Early Settlement of the Purchase Contract represented by such Treasury Units pursuant to the terms of Section 5.04(b)(2) of the Purchase Contract Agreement. Upon Cash Merger Early Settlement of Purchase Contracts by a Holder of the related Treasury Units, the Pledged Treasury Securities represented by such Treasury Units shall be released from the Pledge as provided in the Pledge Agreement. Upon registration of transfer of this Treasury Units Certificate, the transferee shall be bound (without the necessity of any other action on the part of such transferee, except as may be required by the Purchase Contract Agent pursuant to the Purchase Contract Agreement), under the terms of the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Purchase Contracts evidenced hereby and the transferor shall be released from the obligations under the Purchase Contracts evidenced by this Treasury Units Certificate. The Company covenants and agrees, and the Holder, by its acceptance hereof, likewise covenants and agrees, to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph. The Holder of this Treasury Units Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, authorizes the Purchase Contract Agent to enter into and perform the related Purchase Contracts represented by the Treasury Units evidenced hereby on its behalf as its attorney-in-fact, expressly withholds any consent to the assumption (i.e., affirmance) of the Purchase Contracts by the Company or its trustee in the event that the Company becomes the subject of a case under the Bankruptcy Code, C-11

The Holder further covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, but subject to the terms thereof, payments in respect to the aggregate principal amount of the Pledged Treasury Securities on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date shall be paid by the Collateral Agent to the Company in satisfaction of such Holder's obligations under such Purchase Contract and such Holder shall acquire no right, title or interest in such payments. Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the Purchase Contract Agreement may be amended with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority of the Outstanding Units. The Purchase Contracts shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. Prior to due presentment of this Certificate for registration or transfer, the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent and its Affiliates and any agent of the Company or the Purchase Contract Agent may treat the Person in whose name this Treasury Units Certificate is registered as the owner of the Treasury Units evidenced hereby for the purpose of receiving payments of interest on the Treasury Securities, receiving payments of Contract Adjustment Payments (subject to any applicable record date), performance of the Purchase Contracts and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not any payments in respect thereof be overdue and notwithstanding any notice to the contrary, and neither the Company, the Purchase Contract Agent nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The Purchase Contracts shall not, prior to the settlement thereof, entitle the Holder to any of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock. A copy of the Purchase Contract Agreement is available for inspection at the offices of the Purchase Contract Agent. C-12

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. In the case of parties indemnified pursuant to subsection (a) above, counsel to the indemnified parties shall be selected by the Remarketing Agent. An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such action; provided, however, that counsel to the indemnifying party shall not (except with the consent of the indemnified party) also be counsel to the indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 7 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. SECTION 0.08. Contribution. (a) If the indemnification provided for in Section 7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Sections 7(a) or 7(b), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other from the offering of the Remarketed Senior Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other in connection with the statements of omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the other hand in connection with the Remarketing shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes less the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent on the one hand and the H-13
fee paid to the Remarketing Agent on the other hand bear to the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agent on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (a) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (a) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (a), the Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the fees received by it under Section 4 exceeds the amount of any damages which the Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. (b) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Remarketing Agent and to each person, if any, who controls the Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of the Remarketing Agent under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Remarketing Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act. (c) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in Section 7 and this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent or any person controlling the Remarketing Agent, or the Company, its officers or director or any controlling person of the Company, and the completion of the Remarketing. SECTION 0.09. Resignation and Removal of the Remarketing Agent. Any of Citigroup, Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch (the "REMARKETING AGENT CANDIDATES") may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the H-14
Company may remove any of the Remarketing Agent Candidates, by giving 30 days' prior written notice, in the case of a resignation, to the Company and the Depositary and, in the case of a removal, to the removed Remarketing Agent Candidate and the Depositary; provided, however, that if only one Remarketing Agent Candidate remains: (a) such Remarketing Agent Candidate may not resign without reasonable cause; and (b) no such resignation nor any such removal shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor Remarketing Agent and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Company, in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Transaction Documents in all material respects. In any such case, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent and enter into such a remarketing agreement with such person as soon as reasonably practicable. The provisions of Section 7 and Section 8 shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent Candidate pursuant to this Agreement. SECTION 0.10. Dealing in Securities. The Remarketing Agent, when acting as a Remarketing Agent or in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the Remarketed Senior Notes, Corporate Units, Treasury Units or any of the securities of the Company (together, the "SECURITIES"). The Remarketing Agent may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of such Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. SECTION 0.11. Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care. The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. No implied covenants or obligations of or against the Remarketing Agent shall be read into this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties except as otherwise set forth herein. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketed Senior Notes in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, except if H-15
such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from its failure to comply with the material terms of this Agreement or the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part. The provisions of this Section 11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement. SECTION 0.12. Termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate (i) as to the Remarketing Agent on the effective date of the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 9 and (ii) on the earlier of (x) any Special Event Redemption Date and (y) the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of the other provisions hereof, except as otherwise provided herein, the Company shall not be under any liability to the Remarketing Agent and the Remarketing Agent shall not be under any liability to the Company, except that if this Agreement is terminated by the Remarketing Agent because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Remarketing Agent for all of its out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of its counsel) reasonably incurred by it. Section 7, Section 8 and Section 11 hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agent. SECTION 0.13. Notices. All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and: (a) if to the Remarketing Agent Candidates, shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to: Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. 388 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10013 Telecopier No.: [ ] Attention: General Counsel H-16

(b) Each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so under applicable law, that a judgment in any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in Section 17(a) brought in any such court shall be conclusive and binding upon such party, subject to rights of appeal and may be enforced in the courts of the United States of America or the State of New York (or any other court the jurisdiction to which the Company is or may be subject) by a suit upon such judgment.

Whether or not the Company directs the Collateral Agent to take either such action, the Holder's obligations to pay the Stated Amount for the shares of Common Stock will be deemed to be satisfied in full. (b) If a Holder of a Treasury Unit or a Holder of a Corporate Unit (if the Treasury Portfolio has replaced the Senior Notes represented by such Corporate Unit) has not elected to make an effective Cash Settlement by notifying the Purchase Contract Agent in the manner provided for in Section 5.02(f)(i) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, or has given such notice but failed to make such payment in the manner required by Section 5.02(f)(ii) of the Purchase Contract Agreement, such Holder shall be deemed to have elected to pay for the shares of Common Stock to be issued under such Purchase Contracts from the Proceeds of the related Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests, as the case may be. Promptly, after 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately prior to the Purchase Contract Settlement Date, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to invest the Cash Proceeds of the maturing Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests, as the case may be, in Permitted Investments set forth in clause (6) of the definition of Permitted Investments, unless prior to 10:30 a.m. (New York City time) on such date, the Company shall otherwise instruct the Collateral Agent in writing as to the type of Permitted Investments in which any such Cash Proceeds shall be invested. In no event shall the Collateral Agent be liable for the selection of Permitted Investments or for investment losses incurred thereon. The Collateral Agent shall have no liability in respect of losses incurred as a result of the failure of the Company to provide timely written investment direction. Without receiving any instruction from any such Holder, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to remit the Proceeds of the related Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests, as the case may be, to the Company in settlement of such Purchase Contracts on the Purchase Contract Settlement Date. In the event the sum of the Proceeds from the related Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests, as the case may be, and the investment earnings from the investment in Permitted Investments exceeds the aggregate Settlement Price of the Purchase Contracts being settled thereby, the Collateral Agent shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to transfer such excess, when received, to the Purchase Contract Agent for distribution to such Holder. (c) Prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, but no earlier than the Payment Date immediately preceding such date, Holders of Separate Senior Notes may elect to have their Separate Senior Notes remarketed under the Remarketing 18
Agreement, by delivering their Separate Senior Notes along with a notice of such election, substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto, to the Custodial Agent. After such time, such election shall become an irrevocable election to have such Separate Senior Notes remarketed in such Remarketing and, if such Remarketing fails, in any subsequent Remarketing. The Custodial Agent shall hold Separate Senior Notes in an account separate from the Collateral Account in which the Pledged Securities shall be held. Holders of Separate Senior Notes electing to have their Separate Senior Notes remarketed will also have the right to withdraw that election by written notice to the Custodial Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit G hereto, prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, upon which notice the Custodial Agent shall return such Separate Senior Notes to such Holder. By 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Remarketing Date, the Custodial Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent of the aggregate principal amount of the Separate Senior Notes to be remarketed and deliver to the Remarketing Agent for remarketing all Separate Senior Notes delivered to the Custodial Agent pursuant to this Section 5.07(c) and not validly withdrawn prior to such date. In the event of a Successful Remarketing, after deducting the Remarketing Fee (to the extent permitted under the terms of the Remarketing Agreement), the Remarketing Agent will remit to the Custodial Agent the remaining portion of the proceeds of such Remarketing for payment to the Holders of the remarketed Separate Senior Notes, in accordance with their respective interests. In the event of a Failed Remarketing, the Remarketing Agent will promptly return such Separate Senior Notes to the Custodial Agent, and, in the event of a Failed Final Remarketing, the Custodial Agent shall deliver such Separate Senior Notes to the appropriate Holders. Section 5.08. Special Event Redemption.

Upon receipt of any notices and other communications in respect of any Pledged Senior Notes, including notice of any meeting at which holders of the Senior Notes are entitled to vote or solicitation of consents, waivers or proxies of holders of the Senior Notes, the Collateral Agent shall use reasonable efforts to send promptly to the Purchase Contract Agent such notice or communication, and as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of a written request therefor from the Purchase Contract Agent, execute and deliver to the Purchase Contract Agent such proxies and other instruments in respect of such Pledged Senior Notes (in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent) as are prepared by the Company and delivered to the Purchase Contract Agent with respect to the Pledged Senior Notes. ARTICLE 7 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES Section 7.01. Rights And Remedies Of The Collateral Agent. (a) In addition to the rights and remedies specified in Section 5.07 hereof or otherwise available at law or in equity, after an event of default (as specified in Section 7.01(b) below) hereunder, the Collateral Agent shall have all of the rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral of a secured party under the UCC (whether or not the UCC is in effect in the jurisdiction where the rights and remedies are asserted) and the TRADES Regulations and such additional rights and remedies to which a secured party is entitled under the laws in effect in any jurisdiction where any rights and remedies hereunder may be asserted. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such remedies may include, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (1) retention of the Pledged Senior Notes, Pledged Treasury Securities or the applicable Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in full satisfaction of the Holders' obligations under the Purchase Contracts and the Purchase Contract Agreement or (2) sale of the Pledged Senior Notes, Pledged 20
Treasury Securities or the applicable Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests in one or more public or private sales. (b) Without limiting any rights or powers otherwise granted by this Agreement to the Collateral Agent, in the event the Collateral Agent is unable to make payments to the Company on account of the applicable Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests, or on account of principal payments of any Pledged Treasury Securities as provided in Article 3 hereof, in satisfaction of the Obligations of the Holder of the Units represented by such applicable Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests or such Pledged Treasury Securities, as applicable, under the related Purchase Contracts, the inability to make such payments shall constitute an event of default hereunder and the Collateral Agent shall have and may exercise, with reference to such Pledged Treasury Securities or Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests, as applicable, any and all of the rights and remedies available to a secured party under the UCC and the TRADES Regulations after default by a debtor, and as otherwise granted herein or under any other law. (c) Without limiting any rights or powers otherwise granted by this Agreement to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to receive and collect all payments of (i) the principal amount of the Pledged Senior Notes, (ii) the principal amount of the Pledged Treasury Securities and (iii) the principal amount of the Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests, subject, in each case, to the provisions of Article 3 hereof, and as otherwise granted herein. (d) The Purchase Contract Agent and each Holder of Units agrees that, from time to time, upon the written request of the Collateral Agent or the Purchase Contract Agent, such Holder shall execute and deliver such further documents and do such other acts and things as the Collateral Agent may reasonably request or as may be necessary or advisable in order to maintain the Pledge, and the perfection and priority thereof, and to confirm the rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder. The Purchase Contract Agent shall have no liability to any Holder for executing any documents or taking any such acts requested by the Collateral Agent hereunder, except for liability for its own grossly negligent acts, its own grossly negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct. Section 7.02. Special Event Redemption. Upon the occurrence of a Special Event Redemption while Senior Notes are still credited to the Collateral Account, the Collateral Agent is hereby authorized to present the Pledged Senior Notes for payment as may be required by their respective terms and to direct the Indenture Trustee to remit the Redemption Price to the Securities Intermediary for credit to the Collateral Account on or prior to 12:30 p.m., New York City time on such Special Event Redemption Date, by federal funds check or wire transfer of immediately available funds. Upon receipt of such funds, the Pledged Senior Notes shall be released from the Collateral Account. Upon the crediting of such 21
funds to the Collateral Account, the Collateral Agent, at the written direction of the Company, shall instruct the Securities Intermediary to (a) apply an amount equal to the Redemption Amount of such funds to purchase the Treasury Portfolio from the Quotation Agent, (b) credit to the Collateral Account the Applicable Ownership Interests specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term and (c) promptly remit the remaining portion of such funds, if any, to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of Corporate Units, in accordance with their respective interests. Section 7.03. Successful Remarketing. In the event of a Successful Remarketing prior to the Final Remarketing Date, the Collateral Agent shall, at the direction of the Company, instruct the Securities Intermediary to (i) Transfer the Pledged Senior Notes to the Remarketing Agent upon confirmation of deposit by the Remarketing Agent of the Proceeds of such Successful Remarketing (after deducting any Remarketing Fee to the extent permitted under the terms of the Remarketing Agreement) in the Collateral Account, (ii) apply an amount equal to the Treasury Portfolio Purchase Price to purchase from the Quotation Agent the Treasury Portfolio, (iii) credit the Applicable Ownership Interests specified in clause (i) of the definition of such term to the Collateral Account, and (iv) promptly remit the remaining portion of such Proceeds to the Purchase Contract Agent for payment to the Holders of Corporate Units, in accordance with their respective interests. With respect to Separate Senior Notes, any Proceeds of such Remarketing (after deducting any Remarketing Fee to the extent permitted under the terms of the Remarketing Agreement) attributable to the Separate Senior Notes will be remitted to the Custodial Agent for payment to the holders of Separate Senior Notes. The Pledged Applicable Ownership Interests thus credited to the Collateral Account will secure the obligation of all Holders of Corporate Units to purchase Common Stock of the Company under the Purchase Contracts represented by such Corporate Units, in substitution for the Pledged Senior Notes, which shall be released from the Collateral Account. In the event of a Failed Final Remarketing, the Pledged Senior Notes shall remain credited to the Collateral Account. Section 7.04. Substitutions. Whenever a Holder has the right to substitute Treasury Securities, Senior Notes or security entitlements for any of them or the appropriate Applicable Ownership Interests (as defined in clause (i) of the definition of such term) in the Treasury Portfolio, as the case may be, for financial assets held in the Collateral Account, such substitution shall not constitute a novation of the security interest created hereby.

No failure on the part of the Company, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective agents to exercise, and no course of dealing with respect to, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Company, the Collateral Agent, the Custodial Agent, the Securities Intermediary or any of their respective agents of any right, power or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
