FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     WARREN, New Jersey, July 30, 2003  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] today reported that net income in the second quarter of 2003 was a record $252.1 million, a 20% increase over net income of $210.2 million in the second quarter of 2002. Earnings per share increased 21% to $1.45 from $1.20.
     Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, increased 30% in the second quarter of 2003 to a record $238.6 million from $183.6 million in the second quarter of 2002. Operating income per share grew 30% to $1.37 from $1.05 a year ago. Second quarter operating income for 2003 includes an after-tax loss of $4 million or $0.02 per share from the non-insurance business of Chubb Financial Solutions (CFS), compared to a loss of $10 million or $0.06 per share in the second quarter of 2002.
     Chubb adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation as of January 1, 2003. The per-share amounts for the second quarter of 2003 reflect an after-tax charge of $0.07 for the expensing of stock options, compared to no charge in 2002.
     Property and casualty net premiums written in the second quarter of 2003 grew 24% to $2.6 billion. U.S. premiums grew 23%. Non-U.S. premiums grew 30%, or 20% in local currencies.
     The combined loss and expense ratio for the second quarter was 95.3% in 2003 and 98.0% in 2002. Catastrophe losses for the 2003 second quarter were $70.6 million, accounting for 2.8 percentage points of the combined ratio. In the second quarter of 2002, catastrophe losses were $10.3 million, representing half a percentage point of the combined ratio. Excluding catastrophe losses, the combined ratio improved to 92.5% from 97.5%. The expense ratio for the second quarter improved to 30.7% from 31.8%.
 
Six Month Results
     For the first six months of 2003, net income was a record $476.7 million or $2.76 per share, compared with $408.4 million or $2.35 per share for the first half of 2002. Operating income totaled a record $460.3 million or $2.66 per share for the first half of 2003, compared with $387.9 million or $2.23 per share in the first half of 2002. Results for the first six months of 2003 include after-tax income of $5 million or $0.03 per share from CFS, compared with a loss of $10 million or $0.06 per share in the first half of 2002.
     Property and casualty net premiums written in the first six months of 2003 increased 23% to $5.3 billion. The combined ratio for the first half was 95.3% in 2003 and 97.0% in 2002. Catastrophe losses for the 2003 first half were $165.5 million, or 3.4 percentage points of the combined ratio. In the first half of 2002, catastrophe losses were $23.6 million, accounting for 0.6 percentage point of the combined ratio. Excluding catastrophe losses, the combined ratio for the first half improved to 91.9% from 96.4%.
Outlook for 2003
     "We have had two consecutive quarters of record earnings and strong premium growth," said John D. Finnegan, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We had another outstanding quarter in our commercial lines, coupled with solid results in personal lines. Average renewal rates continued to increase, and we had high rates of retention and new business.
     "We are also pleased with the success of our securities offering last month which provided Chubb $1.3 billion in new capital," said Mr. Finnegan. "The new capital will enable us to take advantage of very attractive opportunities in the property and casualty insurance industry while supporting our credit ratings." Net proceeds to the company from the offering of 15.525 million common shares were $887 million. Net proceeds from a simultaneous offering of 18.4 million equity units were $446 million.
     "In light of first half earnings and our expectation of continued strong performance," said Mr. Finnegan, "we are raising guidance for full-year 2003 earnings by $0.30 to a range of $4.90 to $5.30 per share." The company's previous guidance was $4.60 to $5.00 per share. Both the original and revised guidance exclude realized investment gains and losses and assume breakeven results from CFS. The revised guidance also assumes normal catastrophe losses for the balance of this year. "Importantly," said Mr. Finnegan, "the revised guidance comprehends the impact of the additional shares outstanding in the second half as a result of the equity offering completed in June."
 
Operations Review
     (CCI) premiums, which accounted for 37% of Chubb's second-quarter net written premiums, grew 25% to $959 million. The combined ratio improved 3.5 percentage points to 91.6% from 95.1% in the corresponding quarter a year ago, despite a 2.7 percentage point increase in catastrophe losses to 2.9 points from 0.2 points. Excluding catastrophe losses, the combined ratio improved to 88.7% from 94.9%.
Chubb Commercial Insurance
     Average renewal rates in the U.S. increased 12% for CCI, which retained 81% of the U.S. accounts that came up for renewal. CCI wrote 23% more new business in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2003 than in the corresponding quarter of last year. Premiums from new accounts exceeded nonrenewed business by more than a 2-to-1 margin.
     (CSI) premiums, which accounted for 37% of Chubb's total second quarter premiums, grew 31% to $963 million. The combined ratio was 99.5%, compared with 100.8% in the second quarter of 2002, reflecting the continued adverse environment in directors & officers (D&O) and errors & omissions (E&O) insurance.
Chubb Specialty Insurance
     Executive Protection (EP) net written premiums grew 25%, and the business had a combined ratio of 104.1%. While results were good in crime, fiduciary liability and employment practices liability, EP's results continued to be adversely affected by D&O and E&O experience. Average renewal rates in the U.S. for EP were up 49%. Premium growth from rate increases was partially offset by lower exposures, which reflected the company's implementation of tighter terms and conditions, including lower limits, higher deductibles and coinsurance.
     Financial Institutions (FI) net premiums grew 22% in the second quarter. Average renewal rates in the U.S. for FI were up 32%. The combined ratio for FI was 112.3% for the second quarter, reflecting adverse experience in D&O and E&O, partially offset by favorable results in the fidelity and standard commercial portions.
     For the other specialty lines, premiums were up 52%, primarily driven by 114% growth at Chubb Re. The combined ratio for the other specialty lines was 85.3%.
     (CPI) premiums, which accounted for 26% of Chubb's total premiums, grew 13% to $695 million. CPI's combined ratio improved to 93.8% from 97.8% in the second quarter of 2002 despite a 4.7 percentage point increase in catastrophe losses to 6.2 points from 1.5 points. Excluding catastrophe losses, CPI's combined ratio improved 8.7 points to 87.6% from 96.3%, driven mainly by improvement in homeowners insurance.
Chubb Personal Insurance
 
     The homeowners line grew 16% due to rate increases and better insurance to value. The combined ratio was 97.8%, which included 10.1 percentage points of catastrophe losses. Personal automobile grew 13% and had a combined ratio of 99.0%, while other personal lines, which include valuable articles, excess liability and yacht insurance, grew 8% and had a combined ratio of 76.9%.
     after taxes for the second quarter increased 8.6% to $207.2 million from $190.8 million in 2002. For the first half of 2003, property and casualty investment income after taxes increased 7.7% to $405.2 million from $376.4 million.

Definitions of Key Terms
Operating Income
Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax-exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income taxes.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
Book value per share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income, the after-tax appreciation or depreciation on the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities carried at market value. The appreciation or depreciation on available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Combined Ratio or Combined Loss and Expense Ratio
The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. The Corporation evaluates the performance of its insurance businesses by using the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies. It is the sum of the ratio of losses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
Statutory accounting principles differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. To convert underwriting expenses to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and recognized over the period in which the related premiums are earned.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Corporation adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans using the modified prospective method of transition. The change in accounting resulted in a decrease in operating income before income tax of $16.6 million ($11.3 million after-tax) for the second quarter of 2003 and $35.7 million ($25.3 million after-tax) for the six months ended June 30, 2003.
