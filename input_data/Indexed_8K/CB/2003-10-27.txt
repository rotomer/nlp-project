EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     WARREN, New Jersey, October 27, 2003 - The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] today reported that net income in the third quarter of 2003 was $259.8 million or $1.37 per share, compared to a net loss of $242.1 million ($1.42 per share) in the third quarter of 2002.
     Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, was $220.5 million or $1.16 per share in the third quarter of 2003, compared to an operating loss of $270.7 million or $1.59 per share in the third quarter of 2002. The third quarter operating loss for 2002 included a pre-tax charge of $625 million ($2.38 per share after-tax) for the strengthening of asbestos and environmental (A&E) reserves. Third quarter operating income for 2003 includes an after-tax loss of $25.2 million or $0.14 per share from the non-insurance business of Chubb Financial Solutions (CFS), compared to a loss of $26.3 million or $0.15 per share in the third quarter of 2002.
     Chubb adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation as of January 1, 2003. The per-share amounts for the third quarter of 2003 reflect an after-tax charge of $0.05 for the expensing of stock options, compared to no charge in 2002.
     Property and casualty net premiums written in the third quarter of 2003 grew 23% to $2.8 billion. Premiums for Chubb Re nearly tripled, accounting for 8 percentage points of this growth. U.S. premiums grew 23%. Non-U.S. premiums grew 22%, or 15% in local currencies.
     The combined loss and expense ratio for the third quarter was 96.6% in 2003 and 130.0% in 2002. Excluding the A&E charge, the combined ratio for the third quarter of 2002 was 99.9%. Catastrophe losses in the 2003 third quarter were $96.0 million, accounting for 3.7 percentage points of the combined ratio, compared to $51.6 million (2.5 points) in the third quarter of 2002. The expense ratio for the third quarter was 30.9% in 2003 and 31.2% in 2002.
 
Nine Month Results
     For the first nine months of 2003, net income was $736.5 million or $4.13 per share, compared with $166.3 million or $0.96 per share for the first nine months of 2002. Operating income totaled a record $680.8 million or $3.82 per share for the first nine months of 2003, compared with $117.2 million or $0.68 per share in the first nine months of 2002, which reflects the third quarter A&E charge of $625 million ($2.34 per share after-tax). Results for the first nine months of 2003 include an after-tax loss of $19.9 million or $0.11 per share from CFS, compared with a loss of $36.4 million or $0.21 per share in the first nine months of 2002. The per-share amounts for the first nine months of 2003 reflect an after-tax charge of $0.20 for the expensing of stock options, compared to no charge in 2002.
     Property and casualty net premiums written in the first nine months of 2003 increased 23% to $8.1 billion. Chubb Re accounted for 5 percentage points of this growth. The combined ratio for the first nine months was 95.8% in 2003 and 108.7% in 2002; excluding the A&E charge, the combined ratio for the first nine months of 2002 was 98.0%. Catastrophe losses for the first nine months were $261.5 million (3.5 percentage points of the combined ratio) in 2003, compared to $75.2 million (1.3 points) in 2002.
Outlook for 2003
     "Chubb had an outstanding third quarter," said John D. Finnegan, President and Chief Executive Officer, "with substantial premium growth, improved underwriting profitability and higher investment income.
     "Based on results for the first nine months and our expectations for the fourth quarter," said Mr. Finnegan, "we are sufficiently confident to modify full-year earnings guidance to a range of $5.10 to $5.30 per share. Consistent with our previous guidance, this estimate excludes realized investment gains and losses. It also excludes CFS results and assumes 3 percentage points of catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter." The company's previous guidance for 2003 earnings per share was a range of $4.90 to $5.30.
Operations Review
     (CCI) premiums, which accounted for 36% of Chubb's third-quarter net written premiums, grew 18% to $1.02 billion. The combined ratio improved to 90.6% from 175.6%. Excluding the A&E charge, the combined ratio for the third quarter of 2002 was 94.4%. Third quarter catastrophe losses accounted for 2.9 percentage points of the combined ratio in 2003, compared to 5.0 points in 2002.
Chubb Commercial Insurance
 
     Average renewal rates in the U.S. increased 10% for CCI, which retained 80% of the U.S. accounts that came up for renewal. CCI wrote $235 million of new business in the third quarter of 2003, compared to $276 million in the third quarter of 2002. Premiums from new accounts exceeded nonrenewed business by a 1.5-to-1 margin.
     (CSI) premiums, which accounted for 40% of Chubb's total third quarter premiums, grew 37% to $1.14 billion. The combined ratio was 100.6%, compared to 106.1% in the third quarter of 2002.
Chubb Specialty Insurance
     Executive Protection (EP) net written premiums grew 19%, and the business had a combined ratio of 104.2%. EP's results continued to be adversely affected by directors & officers and errors & omissions insurance experience. Average renewal rates in the U.S. for EP were up 34%. Premium growth from rate increases was partially offset by reduced exposures, which reflected the company's implementation of tighter terms and conditions, including lower limits, higher deductibles and coinsurance.
     Financial Institutions (FI) net premiums grew 9% in the third quarter. Average renewal rates in the U.S. for FI were up 32%. The combined ratio for FI was 111.4% for the third quarter, reflecting adverse experience in D&O and E&O, partially offset by favorable results in fidelity.
     For the other specialty lines, premiums were up 97%, primarily driven by 190% growth at Chubb Re. The combined ratio for the other specialty lines was 87.8%.
     (CPI) premiums, which accounted for 24% of Chubb's total premiums, grew 11% to $689 million. CPI's combined ratio was 99.9%, compared to 99.0% in the third quarter of 2002. Catastrophe losses in the third quarter increased to 10.7 percentage points of the combined ratio in 2003 from 2.2 percentage points in 2002. Excluding catastrophe losses, CPI's combined ratio improved 7.6 points to 89.2% from 96.8%, driven by improvement in homeowners insurance.
Chubb Personal Insurance
     The homeowners line grew 14% due to rate increases and better insurance to value. The combined ratio was 108.7%, which included 18.6 percentage points of catastrophe losses. Excluding catastrophe losses, the combined ratio was 90.1%. Personal automobile insurance grew 7% and had a combined ratio of 96.4%, while other personal lines, which include valuable articles, excess liability and yacht insurance, grew 7% and had a combined ratio of 78.7%.
     after taxes for the third quarter increased 12.5% to $213.9 million from $190.1 million in 2002. For the first nine months of 2003, property and casualty investment income after taxes increased 9.3% to $619.1 million from $566.5 million.

Definitions of Key Terms
Operating Income
Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax-exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income taxes.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
Book value per share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income, the after-tax appreciation or depreciation on the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities carried at market value. The appreciation or depreciation on available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Combined Ratio or Combined Loss and Expense Ratio
The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. The Corporation evaluates the performance of its insurance businesses by using the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies. It is the sum of the ratio of losses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
Statutory accounting principles differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. To convert underwriting expenses to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and recognized over the period in which the related premiums are earned.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Corporation adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans using the modified prospective method of transition. The change in accounting resulted in a decrease in operating income before income tax of $15.4 million ($10.4 million after-tax) for the third quarter of 2003 and $51.1 million ($35.7 million after-tax) for the nine months ended September 30, 2003.
 
The 2002 underwriting ratios include the effect of losses of $625.0 million related to asbestos and toxic waste claims recognized in the third quarter. Excluding the effect of such losses, the losses to premiums earned ratio was 68.7% for the third quarter of 2002 and 66.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and the combined loss and expense ratio was 99.9% and 98.0%, respectively.
The increase in unpaid claims and claim expenses for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2002 includes $611.7 million and $617.5 million, respectively, related to asbestos and toxic waste claims.
