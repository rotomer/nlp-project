FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     WARREN, New Jersey, February 3, 2004  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] today reported that net income in the fourth quarter of 2003 was $72.3 million or $0.38 per share, compared to net income of $56.6 million or $0.33 per share in the fourth quarter of 2002.
     Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, was $73.1 million or $0.38 per share in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to operating income of $83.7 million or $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter of 2002.
     Chubb's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2003 included:
     Fourth quarter results for 2002 included a $75 million pre-tax ($0.29 per share after-tax) increase in net asbestos loss reserves reflecting a reduction in the reinsurance recoverable estimate and a $40 million ($0.23 per share) charge to establish a tax valuation allowance related to the future U.S. tax benefit of European losses.
 
     Chubb adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation as of January 1, 2003. The per-share amounts for the fourth quarter of 2003 reflect a charge of $0.05 for the expensing of stock options, compared to no charge in 2002.
     "Chubb has made significant progress in 2003," said John D. Finnegan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, "with solid premium growth, a significant improvement in loss ratio and a lower expense ratio. During the year, we raised new capital, grew the business while maintaining underwriting discipline, restored profitability to our European operations and infused the Chubb culture with a mindset of expense control. Just as important, we resolved the World Trade Center reinsurance recoverables issue and mitigated the risks of the CFS derivatives portfolio."

Asbestos Reserve Strengthening
     Together with its independent outside actuaries, Chubb has just completed a rigorous update of the 2002 ground-up asbestos reserve analysis. Based on developments related to its insureds and on overall industry experience, an increase in reserves was indicated. Consistent with Chubb's policy of maintaining reserve adequacy, the company has increased its net reserves by $250 million. This increase reflects the best estimate of its actuaries and is based on the latest information available.
 
     "Based upon this detailed update," said Mr. Finnegan, "we have as high a level of confidence in the adequacy of our asbestos reserves as is possible in this dynamic and challenging environment."
     Total reserves for asbestos as of year end 2003 were just over $1 billion. A detailed update of Chubb's asbestos reserves has been posted on the company's Internet site at www.chubb.com.
CFS Developments
     As announced in April 2003, Chubb is running off the financial products portfolio of CFS, which was established in 2000.
     "Since deciding to exit the credit derivatives business," said Mr. Finnegan, "I have been particularly focused on minimizing the potential of our having to make a large payment due to an unexpected credit event over the next few years. The new agreement achieves this objective by limiting our exposure while deferring any payment obligations that might come due. Given the high quality of the remaining portfolio, the cap announced today greatly reduces the magnitude of our downside exposure from this runoff business."
     At September 30, 2003, CFS's aggregate notional exposure from its credit default swap portfolio was $39 billion. By year end 2003, Chubb had reduced the aggregate notional exposure by $14 billion to $25 billion. The remaining portfolio consists of $11 billion of asset-backed securities, $11 billion of corporate debt obligations and $3 billion of loan portfolios.
     Included in the $14 billion reduction were two asset-backed portfolios aggregating $3.9 billion of notional exposure. Chubb has previously indicated that it had experienced deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying securities of these two portfolios. Although the subordination limits had not been pierced, the credit quality deterioration had resulted in mark-to-market losses of $70 million during the first nine months of 2003 and a $140 million carried liability at September 30, 2003 related to the two portfolios.
     In order to cap its exposure to these two asset-backed portfolios, CFS paid $50 million in the fourth quarter to terminate the two contracts and entered into a new contract which guarantees principal and interest obligations on only $2.3 billion of the original $3.9 billion notional amount. Under the new agreement, CFS's potential payment obligations have been extended from the original termination dates of 2007 and 2008 to the date when the last of the underlying obligations expire.
     Under the new agreement, CFS's maximum payment obligation is limited to $500 million regardless of the amount of losses that might be incurred on the $2.3 billion portfolio. Moreover, if losses are incurred, CFS's payment obligations are limited to an extended payment schedule under which no payment would be due until 2010 at the earliest.
 
     CFS has established a liability of $186 million related to the new contract, which represents the estimated fair value of the principal and interest guarantee. The new liability was partially offset by the elimination of the old contracts' liability of $140 million, resulting in a net increase in liability of $46 million. Together with the payment of $50 million to terminate the old contracts, this resulted in the fourth quarter pre-tax charge of $96 million.
     "We are pleased that we have succeeded in capping our exposure to the two asset-backed portfolios that had experienced deterioration in underlying credit quality," said Michael O'Reilly, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. "We have reduced the notional exposure of CFS's credit derivatives portfolio to $25 billion at year end 2003 from a peak level of $43 billion at June 30, 2003. Apart from the two contracts covered by this agreement, this reduction has been achieved with a neutral impact on earnings. We will continue our efforts to reduce our remaining notional exposure, depending on market conditions."
2004 Operating Income Guidance
     "The strong fundamentals in our property and casualty insurance business form a solid foundation for our expectation that 2004 will be a rewarding year for Chubb," said Mr. Finnegan, "with operating income in the range of $5.90 to $6.30 per share, subject to the risks outlined in the company's forward looking information safe-harbor statements. Our forecast assumes normal catastrophe losses and excludes CFS results."
     Mr. Finnegan said the operating income guidance is based on the assumption of:

Definitions of Key Terms
Operating Income
Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of three separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance and specialty insurance. Performance of the business units is based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax-exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
 
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
Book value per share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income, the after-tax appreciation or depreciation on the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities carried at market value. The appreciation or depreciation on available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Combined Ratio or Combined Loss and Expense Ratio
The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Corporation adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans using the modified prospective method of transition.
