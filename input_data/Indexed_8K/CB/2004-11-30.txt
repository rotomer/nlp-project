Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
As previously disclosed, as part of ongoing investigations of market practices in the insurance industry, The Chubb Corporation (Chubb) has received subpoenas and other information requests from the Attorneys General of several states, as well as from insurance regulators. On November 29, 2004, Chubb received a subpoena from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as part of a fact finding inquiry into certain loss mitigation insurance products. Chubb believes this investigation involves a number of industry participants and that Chubb has not been singled out in being asked to provide information to the SEC. The SEC subpoena is similar to another subpoena received by Chubb from the New York Attorney General. Chubb intends to cooperate fully with the SEC and continues to cooperate with the other ongoing investigations.
