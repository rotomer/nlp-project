The expense ratio for the fourth quarter was 27.9% in 2004 and 29.6% in 2003.
 
Full Year Results
     For the year ended December 31, 2004, net income was $1.55 billion or $8.01 per share, compared with $808.8 million or $4.46 per share for the year ended December 31, 2003. Operating income for 2004 totaled a record $1.40 billion or $7.26 per share, compared with $753.9 million or $4.16 per share in 2003.

     Property and casualty net premiums written in 2004 increased 9% to $12.05 billion. Excluding Chubb Re, premiums increased 8%. The combined ratio for 2004 was 92.3%  the best combined ratio achieved since Chubb was incorporated in 1967. Excluding the asbestos reserve strengthening, the combined ratio was 91.7%. In 2003, the combined ratio was 98.0% including the asbestos reserve strengthening and 95.5% without it.

The expense ratio for the year was 29.2% in 2004 and 30.4% in 2003.
     "An excellent fourth quarter capped off an outstanding year for Chubb, with significant profit improvement achieved through superior underwriting, better expense control and higher investment income," said John D. Finnegan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We benefited from substantially improved results at Chubb Personal Insurance and continued excellent performance at Chubb Commercial Insurance."
Fourth Quarter Operations Review
     (CPI) premiums grew 11% to $713 million. CPI's combined ratio was 80.5%, compared to 96.0% in the fourth quarter of 2003. Catastrophe losses were negligible in 2004, while in 2003 they accounted for 4.0 percentage points of the combined ratio.

2005 Operating Income Guidance
     "We are very pleased with the substantial improvement in our operating results for 2004, particularly in Chubb Personal Insurance, which turned in an excellent year despite the worst hurricane season since 1992," said Mr. Finnegan. "Going forward, we expect earnings to improve as we continue to focus on disciplined underwriting and expense management. We believe we can achieve 2005 operating income in the range of $7.60 to $8.00 per share. As was the case last year, our forecast assumes 3 points of catastrophe losses and excludes results of CFS."
 
     Mr. Finnegan said the operating income guidance is based on the assumption of:

Definitions of Key Terms
Operating Income
Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of three separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance and specialty insurance. Performance of the business units is based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax-exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
 
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
Book value per share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income, the after-tax appreciation or depreciation on the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at market value. The appreciation or depreciation on available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Combined Ratio or Combined Loss and Expense Ratio
The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
 
FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
     Certain statements in this document, and certain oral statements made by management from time to time, are "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA).

Forward-looking statements are made based upon management's current expectations and beliefs concerning trends and future developments and their potential effects on us. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, which include, among others, those discussed or identified from time to time in our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and those associated with:
