Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
.  On March 3, 2005, the Organization & Compensation Committee of The Chubb Corporation (Chubb) approved base salary increases for each of Chubb's named executive officers.  A schedule detailing the salary increases for Messrs. Finnegan, Degnan, Motamed, O'Reilly and Krump is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01 of Form 8-K.
Named Executive Officer Salary Actions
 
.  On March 8, 2005, Chubb's Organization & Compensation Committee finalized the formula for calculating 2005 annual incentive compensation awards. A schedule setting forth the formula components is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01 of Form 8-K.
2005 Annual Incentive Compensation Award Formula
 
.  In response to the newly adopted deferred compensation rules promulgated under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act), on March 3, 2005, Chubb's Organization & Compensation Committee approved changes to the following forms of equity award agreements under The Chubb Corporation Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (2004):
Employee Equity Award Agreements
 
The total shareholder return performance share award agreements for (i) Chubb's Chief Executive Officer and the Vice Chairmen, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.3 and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01 of Form 8-K; (ii) Chubb's Executive Vice Presidents and certain Senior Vice Presidents, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.4 and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01 of Form 8-K; and (iii) all other eligible participants in The Chubb Corporation Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (2004), which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.5 and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01 of Form 8-K. The difference among the forms of performance share award agreements is in the mandatory deferral provision. Under certain circumstances described in the agreement, the Chief Executive Officer and the Vice Chairmen are required to defer receipt of their respective awards until attaining age 60 and termination of their employment with Chubb. For Executive Vice Presidents and certain Senior Vice Presidents, the award agreement mandates deferral of payment under certain circumstances for up to two years from the vesting date of the applicable award. The form of award agreement for other recipients of performance shares does not contain a mandatory deferral provision.

The restricted stock unit award agreement for all eligible participants in The Chubb Corporation Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (2004), which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.6 and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01 of Form 8-K.
 - 
                 
 
The option award agreements, intended solely for grants to employees residing outside the United States where tax efficiencies make such awards preferable to other forms of equity, which are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.7 and 10.8, respectively, and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01 of Form 8-K.
 - 
                 
 
.  On March 3, 2005, Chubb's Organization & Compensation Committee approved The Chubb Corporation Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan (2005), which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.9 and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01 of Form 8-K.
Deferred Compensation Plan
 
.  On March 4, 2005, Chubb's Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee approved changes to the stock unit and total shareholder return performance share award agreements under The Chubb Corporation Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors (2004). As with the equity award agreements under The Chubb Corporation Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (2004), these changes were made in response to the Jobs Act's new deferred compensation rules. Similar to the mandatory deferral requirement to which the Chief Executive Officer and the Vice Chairmen are subject, under certain circumstances, non-employee directors are required to defer receipt of performance shares until the end of their respective directorships. The forms of award agreements for non-employee directors are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.10 and 10.11, respectively, and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01 of Form 8-K.
Director Equity Award Agreements
 
.  On March 4, 2005, Chubb's Board of Directors formalized its policy regarding personal use of corporate aircraft by Chubb officers. A description of this policy is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.12 and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01 of Form 8-K.

Payment of Earned Performance Shares
 
.  Subject to the provisions of this Section 2, Section 4 and Section 5, the Payment Value of each Performance Share covered by the Award which the Committee determines, in writing, to be earned pursuant to Section 3 shall be paid by the Corporation on a date (the "vesting date") as soon as administratively practicable after (but no later than 2 months after the calendar year end coincident with) the end of the Performance Cycle described in Section 3(a).  Payments hereunder shall be made in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination thereof, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.  Notwithstanding the aforementioned, the vesting date shall be the last day of the Performance Cycle if (i) the Participant experiences a Qualified Termination of Employment on or after December 31, 2005 or (ii) the Committee determines, in its discretion, pursuant to Section 4(b), that the Participant will not

forfeit his or her rights to Performance Shares upon his or her termination of employment for other reasons; in either case, provided the Committee determines, in writing, that Performance Shares are to be awarded hereunder.
 
  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2(a), the Participant may elect, by election filed with the Corporation under its Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan (2005) (or any successor plan or program), and on a form acceptable to the Committee, not later than June 30, 2007 and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify, to have any payment that may become due in respect of Performance Shares covered by the Award deferred until such later time as shall be specified in such election (or, if applicable, the date determined pursuant to Section 2(c)).

.  Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 2(a) or 2(b) to the contrary (unless the payment date elected pursuant to Section 2(b) is later than the payment date specified herein, in which case Section 2(b) shall control), if the Corporation's Ending Average Value is less than the Corporation's Beginning Average Value (as such terms are defined in Section 3(c)), no settlement shall be made in respect of any Performance Shares earned in accordance with Section 3 until the earlier of () the first date on or before March 10, 2009 on which the average of the averages of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Stock reported for consolidated trading of issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange for the 15 trading days prior to such date exceeds the Beginning Average Value and () the first date on which the Participant has both reached age 60 and terminated employment with the Corporation and all other members of the Corporation's controlled group of entities.  Once either of the conditions described in the immediately preceding sentence has been satisfied, settlement shall occur as soon as practicable thereafter (and in the case of condition (), not later than March 15, 2009) in cash, shares of Stock or a combination thereof, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.  If the Participant experiences a Qualified Termination of Employment on or after December 31, 2005, or if the Committee determines, in its discretion pursuant to Section 4(b), that the Participant will not forfeit his or her rights to Performance Shares upon his or her termination of employment for other reasons, settlement shall not occur until the first date on which the Participant has attained age 60 (or, in the case of the Participant's death, would have attained age 60).  If a Participant terminates employment after reaching age 60, is a "specified employee" (as that term is defined in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code) at the time he or she terminates employment, and is scheduled to have his or her Performance Shares settled pursuant to condition (ii), no settlement shall be made until at least six months after such termination of employment, or the Participant's death, if earlier.

Vesting Criteria Applicable to Performance Shares.
 
.  The Performance Cycle for this Award shall commence on May 1, 2005, and shall end on December 31, 2007.
(a)
                                                 
Performance Cycle
 
.  The Performance Goal for the Performance Cycle is the total return per share of Stock to the Corporation's shareholders, inclusive of dividends paid (regardless of whether paid in cash or property, which dividends shall be deemed reinvested in Stock), during the Performance Cycle in comparison to the total return per share of stock, inclusive of dividends paid (regardless of whether paid in cash or property, which dividends shall be deemed reinvested in stock), achieved by the companies () which are in the Standard & Poors 500 Index (the "") on the date the Performance Cycle begins and () which continue to file public reports pursuant to the Act for the entirety of the Performance Cycle (such companies, the "").  For the avoidance of doubt, a company included in the S&P 500 on the date the Performance Cycle commences that is not included in the S&P 500 at the conclusion of the Performance Cycle will be a Comparison Company as long as it files public reports pursuant to the Act for the entire Performance Cycle (and any company first included in the S&P 500 after the start of the Performance Cycle would not be a Comparison Company).

Comparison Companies
 
.  Except as provided in Section 5, the Performance Shares covered by the Award shall be deemed earned based on where the Corporation's total shareholder return during the Performance Cycle ranks in relation to the total shareholder returns of the Comparison Companies during such period.  For purposes of calculating the total shareholder return of the Corporation and the Comparison Companies during the Performance Cycle, the value of each such company's stock at the beginning and end of the Performance Cycle shall be established based on the average of the averages of the high and low trading prices of the applicable stock on the principal exchange on which the stock trades for the 15 trading days occurring immediately prior to the beginning or end of the Performance Cycle, as the case may be.  Such averages for each such company (including the Corporation) shall be referred to herein as the "" and the "."  As soon as practicable after the completion of the Performance Cycle, the total shareholder returns of the Comparison Companies will be calculated and ranked from highest to lowest.  The Corporation's total shareholder return will then be ranked in terms of which percentile it would have placed in among the Comparison Companies.  In calculating the total shareholder return with respect to either the Corporation or any of the Comparison Companies, the Committee shall make or shall cause to be made such appropriate adjustments to the calculation of total shareholder return for such entity (including, without

limitation, adjusting the Beginning Average Value) as shall be necessary or appropriate to avoid an artificial increase or decrease in such return as a result of a stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization or other similar event affecting the capital structure of such entity that does not involve the issuance of the entity's securities in exchange for money, property or other consideration.
 
  The extent to which Performance Shares shall become earned on the vesting date described in Section 2(a) shall be determined according to the following schedule:
(d)
                                                
Percentage of Performance Shares Earned.
 
 
To the extent that the Corporation's total shareholder return ranks in a percentile between the 25 and the 50 percentile, or between the 50 and the 85percentile, of comparative performance, then the number of Performance Shares earned on the vesting date shall be determined by multiplying the relative percentile of comparative performance achieved by the Corporation by two (e.g., if the Corporation's total shareholder return would have placed in the 40 percentile, then 80% of the Performance Shares covered by the Award become earned on the vesting date; if the Corporation's total shareholder return would have placed in the 75 percentile, then 150% of the Performance Shares covered by the Award become earned on the vesting date).

.  Except as provided in this Section 4 or in Section 5, the Participant shall not have any right to any payment hereunder unless the Participant is employed by the Corporation or a Subsidiary on the date the Performance Shares subject to this Award are settled pursuant to Section 2(a) (or would have been settled without regard to any other provision of Section 2).

Termination of Employment
 
.  If the Participant's employment terminates by reason of a Qualifying Termination of Employment on or after December 31, 2005, the Participant shall be entitled to receive the same Payment Values (without pro-ration) in respect of the Performance Shares covered by the Award as would have been payable, and at the same time and

subject to the same conditions, had his or her employment continued until the end of the Performance Cycle.
 
.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if the Participant's employment is terminated prior to the date on which the Performance Shares subject to this Award are settled pursuant to Section 2(a) (or would have been settled without regard to any other provision of Section 2) for any reason other than a Qualifying Termination of Employment occurring on or after December 31, 2005, all of the Participant's rights to Performance Shares covered by the Award shall be immediately forfeited and canceled without further action by the Corporation or the Participant as of the date of such termination of employment.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Participant's Performance Shares shall be immediately forfeited and cancelled without further action by the Corporation or the Participant upon the Participant's termination of employment for Cause.
(b)
                                
Termination for any Other Reason
 
.  Transfer from the Corporation to a Subsidiary, from a Subsidiary to the Corporation, or from one Subsidiary to another shall not be considered a termination of employment.  Any question regarding whether a Participant's employment has terminated in connection with a leave of absence or other absence from active employment shall be determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, taking into account the provisions of applicable law and the Corporation's generally applicable employment policies and practices.  The Committee may also suspend the operation of the termination of employment provisions of this Agreement for such period and upon such terms and conditions as it may deem necessary or appropriate to further the interests of the Corporation.
(c)
                                 
Transfers between the Corporation and Subsidiaries; Leaves, Other Absences and Suspension
 
.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4(b), if the Participant's employment is involuntarily terminated other than for Cause or if the Participant terminates employment due to death or Disability, in all such cases on or after the date the Corporation's shareholders approve a Change in Control pursuant to subsections (iii) or (iv) of such definition but prior to the consummation of such Change in Control, the Participant shall be treated as having continued employment through, and terminated employment immediately after, such Change in Control.
(d)
                                
Termination Pursuant to a Change in Control
 
.  Notwithstanding anything in Section 2 or 3 to the contrary, in the event a Change in Control occurs, Performance Shares covered by the Award not previously forfeited pursuant to Section 4 shall be treated in accordance with Section 9 of the Plan, in which case the Performance Shares covered by the Award shall become earned and payable as provided in Sections 9(a)(ii) and 9(a)(iii) of the Plan or, if applicable, be honored, assumed or substituted for in accordance with Section 9(b) of the Plan.
5.
                                      
Change in Control
.  In the event that the Committee shall determine that any stock dividend, stock split, share combination, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, exchange of shares, warrants or rights offering to purchase Stock at a price substantially below fair market value, or other similar corporate event affects the Stock such that an adjustment is required in order to preserve, or to prevent the enlargement of, the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Award, then the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, and in such manner as the Committee may deem equitable, adjust any or all of the number and kind of Performance Shares subject to this Award and/or, if deemed appropriate, make provision for a cash payment to the person holding this Award, provided, however, that, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the number of Performance Shares subject to this Award shall always be a whole number.

Adjustment in Capitalization
 
.  Performance Shares may not be sold, assigned, hypothecated, pledged or otherwise transferred or encumbered in any manner except () by will or the laws of descent and distribution or () to a "Permitted Transferee" (as defined in Section 11(b) of the Plan) with the permission of, and subject to such conditions as may be imposed by, the Committee.

10.
                                
Restrictive Covenants
 
.  A Participant shall not, without prior written authorization from the Corporation, disclose to anyone outside the Corporation, or use (other than in the Corporation's or any of the Subsidiaries' business), any confidential information or material relating to the business of the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries that is acquired by the Participant either during or after employment with the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries.
(a)
                                 
Non-Disclosure
 
.  A Participant shall not during his or her employment with the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries and for a period of one year following any termination of such employment relationship, directly or indirectly, solicit, persuade, encourage or induce any individual employed by the
(b)
                                
Non-Solicitation
Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries during the above-referenced time periods to become employed by or associated with any person or entity other than the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries, which employs the Participant or for which the Participant serves as an officer, director, shareholder, partner or consultant, or with any firm related to any such person or entity or to permit any other person or entity to do so on the Participant's behalf.
 
.  A Participant shall disclose promptly and assign to the Corporation all right, title, and interest in any invention or idea, patentable or not, made or conceived by the Participant during employment by the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries, relating in any manner to the actual or anticipated business, research or development work of the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries and shall do anything reasonably necessary to enable the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries to secure a patent, copyright or any other intellectual property rights where appropriate in the United States and in foreign countries.
(c)
                                 
Inventions
 
.  Failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 10 at any point before payment in respect of earned Performance Shares covered by the Award is made pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 or 5 shall cause all Performance Shares covered by the Award to be cancelled and rescinded without any payment therefor.  In the event that all or any portion of the Performance Shares covered by this Award shall have been settled in accordance with the terms of this Agreement within six months of the date on which any breach by the Participant of any of the provisions of this Section 10 shall have first occurred, the Committee may require that the Participant repay (with interest or appreciation (if any), as applicable, determined up to the date payment is made), and the Participant shall promptly repay, to the Corporation the value of any cash or property (including the Fair Market Value of any Stock) conveyed to the Participant within such period in respect of such Performance Shares.  Additionally, the Participant agrees that the Corporation shall be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or such other equitable relief restraining the Participant from committing any violation of the covenants or obligations contained in this Section 10.  These rescission rights and injunctive remedies are cumulative and are in addition to any other rights and remedies the Corporation may have at law or in equity.  The Participant acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and obligations in this Section 10 relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters and that a violation or threatened violation of any of the terms of such covenants or obligations will cause the Corporation and the Subsidiaries irreparable injury for which adequate remedies are not available at law.

Relief with Respect to Violations of Covenants

of its business.  If any restriction contained in this Section 10 shall be deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by reason of the extent, duration or geographical scope hereof, or otherwise, then the court making such determination shall have the right to reduce such extent, duration, geographical scope or other provisions hereof, and in its reduced form such restriction shall then be enforceable in the manner contemplated hereby.
 
.  The Corporation shall have the right to deduct from all amounts paid to the Participant in cash in respect of Performance Shares covered by the Award any amount of taxes required by law to be withheld as may be necessary in the opinion of the Corporation to satisfy tax withholding required under the laws of any country, state, province, city or other jurisdiction.  In the case of any payments of Performance Shares covered by the Award in the form of Stock, at the Committee's discretion, the Participant shall be required to either pay to the Corporation the amount of any taxes required to be withheld with respect to such Stock or, in lieu thereof, the Corporation shall have the right to retain (or the Participant may be offered the opportunity to elect to tender) the number of shares of Stock whose Fair Market Value equals such amount required to be withheld.
11.
                                
Withholding

Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or in any way restrict the power of the Committee, consistent with the terms of the Plan, to delegate any of the powers reserved to it hereunder to such person or persons as it shall designate from time to time.
12.
                                
Committee Discretion; Delegation
 
.  Neither the execution and delivery hereof nor the granting of the Award shall constitute or be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, on the part of the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries to employ or continue the employment of the Participant for any period.
13.

(a)
                                 
Performance Cycle
 
.  The Performance Goal for the Performance Cycle is the total return per share of Stock to the Corporation's shareholders, inclusive of dividends paid (regardless of whether paid in cash or property, which dividends shall be deemed reinvested in Stock), during the Performance Cycle in

For the avoidance of doubt, a company included in the S&P 500 on the date the Performance Cycle commences that is not included in the S&P 500 at the conclusion of the Performance Cycle will be a Comparison Company as long as it files public reports pursuant to the Act for the entire Performance Cycle (and any company first included in the S&P 500 after the start of the Performance Cycle would not be a Comparison Company).

Comparison Companies
 
.  Except as provided in Section 5, the Performance Shares covered by the Award shall be deemed earned based on where the Corporation's total shareholder return during the Performance Cycle ranks in relation to the total shareholder returns of the Comparison Companies during such period.  For purposes of calculating the total shareholder return of the Corporation and the Comparison Companies during the Performance Cycle, the value of each such company's stock at the beginning and end of the Performance Cycle shall be established based on the average of the averages of the high and low trading prices of the applicable stock on the principal exchange on which the stock trades for the 15 trading days occurring immediately prior to the beginning or end of the Performance Cycle, as the case may be.  Such averages for each such company (including the Corporation) shall be referred to herein as the "" and the "."  As soon as practicable after the completion of the Performance Cycle, the total shareholder returns of the Comparison Companies will be calculated and ranked from highest to lowest.  The Corporation's total shareholder return will then be ranked in terms of which percentile it would have placed in among the Comparison Companies.  In calculating the total shareholder return with respect to either the Corporation or any of the Comparison Companies, the Committee shall make or shall cause to be made such appropriate adjustments to the calculation of total shareholder return for such entity (including, without limitation, adjusting the Beginning Average Value) as shall be necessary or appropriate to avoid an artificial increase or decrease in such return as a result of a stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization or other similar event affecting the capital structure of such entity that does not involve the issuance of the entity's securities in exchange for money, property or other consideration.

(d)
                                
Percentage of Performance Shares Earned.
 
To the extent that the Corporation's total shareholder return ranks in a percentile between the 25 and the 50 percentile, or between the 50 and the 85percentile, of comparative performance, then the number of Performance Shares earned on the vesting date shall be determined by multiplying the relative percentile of comparative performance achieved by the Corporation by two (e.g., if the Corporation's total shareholder return would have placed in the 40 percentile, then 80% of the Performance Shares covered by the Award become earned on the vesting date; if the Corporation's total shareholder return would have placed in the 75 percentile, then 150% of the Performance Shares covered by the Award become earned on the vesting date).

Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, if the Participant's employment is terminated prior to the date on which the Performance Shares subject to this Award are settled pursuant to Section 2(a) (or would have been settled without regard to any other provision of Section 2) for any reason other than a Qualifying Termination of Employment occurring on or after December 31, 2005, all of the Participant's rights to Performance Shares covered by the Award shall be immediately forfeited and canceled without further action by the Corporation or the Participant as of the date

Termination for any Other Reason
of such termination of employment.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Participant's Performance Shares shall be immediately forfeited and cancelled without further action by the Corporation or the Participant upon the Participant's termination of employment for Cause.
 
.  Transfer from the Corporation to a Subsidiary, from a Subsidiary to the Corporation, or from one Subsidiary to another shall not be considered a termination of employment.

The Committee may also suspend the operation of the termination of employment provisions of this Agreement for such period and upon such terms and conditions as it may deem necessary or appropriate to further the interests of the Corporation.

Notwithstanding anything in Section 2 or 3 to the contrary, in the event a Change in Control occurs, Performance Shares covered by the Award not previously forfeited pursuant to Section 4 shall be treated in accordance with Section 9 of the Plan, in which case the Performance Shares covered by the Award shall become earned and payable as provided in Sections 9(a)(ii) and 9(a)(iii) of the Plan or, if applicable, be honored, assumed or substituted for in accordance with Section 9(b) of the Plan.

Restrictive Covenants

Non-Disclosure
 
.  A Participant shall not during his or her employment with the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries and for a period of one year following any termination of such employment relationship, directly or indirectly, solicit, persuade, encourage or induce any individual employed by the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries during the above-referenced time periods to become employed by or associated with any person or entity other than the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries, which employs the Participant or for which the Participant serves as an officer, director, shareholder, partner or consultant, or with any firm related to any such person or entity or to permit any other person or entity to do so on the Participant's behalf.
(b)

To the extent that the Corporation's total shareholder return ranks in a percentile between the 25 and the 50 percentile, or between the 50 and the 85percentile, of comparative performance, then the number of Performance Shares earned on the vesting date shall be determined by multiplying the relative percentile of comparative performance achieved by the Corporation by two (e.g., if the Corporation's total shareholder return would have placed in the 40 percentile, then 80% of the Performance Shares covered by the Award become earned on the vesting date; if the Corporation's total shareholder return would

The value of the Participant's Deferral Amounts that are deemed invested in the Company Stock Unit Account shall be determined by multiplying the number of Units by the value of the closing price of one share of Company Stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Listing on the applicable Valuation Date.

The hypothetical investment of the Participants' Deferred Compensation Accounts in the Investment Funds and/or in the Company Stock Unit Account shall be for bookkeeping purposes only, and shall not require the establishment of actual corresponding funds by the Committee or the Company.

2.
                                
If, on the date a Participant has a Termination of Employment, the value of the Participant's Deferred Compensation Accounts for all Cycles does not exceed $10,000, then, notwithstanding the elections made by such Participant on the Election Form(s) filed with the Committee, all of the Participant's Deferral Amounts shall be paid in a lump sum at the time provided in Section 8.06 for a Termination of Employment.
b.
                                     
If a Participant elects to receive payment of that portion of his or her Deferred Compensation Account in annual installments, subject to a maximum of fifteen (15) installments, payments shall be made in Declining Balance Installments.
                                               
8.03           In the event that the Committee, upon written petition of the Participant, determines in its sole discretion that the Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Company shall pay to the Participant, as soon as is practicable following such determination, an amount necessary to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution.  In making a decision regarding whether a request meets the definition of an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Committee shall take into account the extent to which the hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement by insurance or by liquidation of the Participant's assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship.  The Deferred Compensation Account of the Participant thereafter shall be reduced to reflect the Unforeseeable Emergency payment.
Unforeseeable Emergency.
                                               
8.04           A Participant shall have no right to modify in any way the schedule for the distribution of amounts from his or her Deferred Compensation Account that the Participant has specified in his or her Election Form.  However, upon a written request submitted by the Participant to the Committee (on an Election Form), the
Request to Committee for Delay in Payment.
Committee may, in its sole discretion, postpone the payment, change the form of payment to annual installments or increase the number of installments not to exceed fifteen (15), provided:
a.             The postponement in the payment, change to annual installments, or increase in the number of installments to a number of installments not to exceed fifteen (15) does not take effect until at least twelve (12) months after the date the Election Form on which the request is based is filed;
b.             The postponement in the payment must be for a period of at least five (5) years from the date the payment would otherwise have been made, except in the case of elections relating to distributions on death, Disability or Unforeseeable Emergency; and
c.             The request to postpone the payment, change to annual installments, or increase the number of installments to a number of installments not to exceed fifteen (15), must be made at least twelve (12) months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment.
8.05

8.06
                          
Date of Payments.
a.             Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, with respect to Termination of Employment, death, Disability or a Change in Control Event, payments under this Plan shall be made (or begin in the case of installments) at the end of the Calendar Quarter during which the Participant or Beneficiary becomes eligible to receive such payment, unless the Termination of Employment, death, Disability or Change in Control Event occurs within the last ten (10) days of a Calendar Quarter, in which case, payment will be made (or installments will begin) on the last day of the following Calendar Quarter; provided, however, that payments must be made (or begin in the case of installments) no later than the later of (i)
December 31 of the year in which the distribution event occurs, or (ii) thirty (30) days after the distribution event.
                                                                                         
b.             Payments that are to be made on March 31 of a specified year shall be made (or begin in the case of installments) on, or as soon as administratively practicable after, such date; provided, however, that payments must be made (or begin in the case of installments) no later than thirty (30) days after the date.
                                                                                               
c.             Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if the Participant is a Key Employee, then, notwithstanding the Election Form filed with the Committee, no payment may be made (or begin in the case of installments) to such Key Employee prior to the date which is six (6) months following the Key Employee's Termination of Employment (or death, if earlier).
                                               
8.07           If a distribution of a portion of a Deferred Compensation Account for a Cycle is made to a Participant or Beneficiary, and the amounts for such Cycle are invested in more than one of the Investment Funds, then a portion of such distribution shall be deemed to have been made from each of the Investment Funds on a pro rata basis, based on the values of the Investment Funds as of the Valuation Date immediately preceding the distribution.
Allocation of Distributions.
9.             Beneficiary Designation
                                               
At any time prior to the complete distribution of the benefits due to a Participant under the Plan, he or she shall have the right to designate, change, and/or cancel, any person(s) or entity as his or her Beneficiary (either primary or contingent) to whom payment under this Plan shall be made in the event of his or her death.  Each beneficiary designation shall become effective only when filed in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime on a form provided by the Company.  The filing of a new beneficiary designation form will cancel all previously filed beneficiary designations relating to such Cycle or Cycles.  Further, any finalized divorce of a Participant subsequent to the date of filing of a beneficiary designation form in favor of Participant's spouse shall automatically revoke such designation without any action having to be taken by the Participant.
                                               
Additionally, the spouse of a Participant domiciled in a community property jurisdiction shall join in the Participant's designation of any Beneficiary other than his or her spouse.
                                               
If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided above, or if his or her beneficiary designation is revoked by divorce or otherwise without execution of a new designation, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant, then the distribution of such benefits shall be made to the Participant's estate in a lump sum.  If the Participant's designated Beneficiary survives the Participant but dies before receiving a complete distribution of the Participant's account, the remaining Deferred Compensation Account balance shall be paid to the estate of such Beneficiary in a lump sum.

11.01         Participants and their beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assignees shall have no legal or equitable rights, interests, or other claims in any property or assets of the Company, nor shall they be beneficiaries of, or have any rights, claims, or interests in any life insurance policies, annuity contracts, or the policies therefrom owned or that may be acquired by the Company ("policies").  Such policies or other assets of the Company shall not be held in any way as collateral security for the fulfilling of the obligations of the Company under this Plan.  Any and all of the Company's assets and policies shall be and will remain general, unpledged, unrestricted assets of the Company.  The Company's obligation under the Plan shall be that of an unfunded and unsecured promise of the Company to pay money in the future.
Unsecured General Creditor.
                                               
11.02         Although the Company is responsible for the payment of all benefits under the Plan, the Company, in its sole discretion, may contribute funds as it deems appropriate to a grantor trust for the purpose of paying benefits under this Plan.  Such trust may be irrevocable, but assets of the trust shall be subject to the claims of creditors of the Company.  Such grantor trust shall not in any event locate or transfer its assets to a location outside the United States nor shall it provide that assets will be restricted to the provision of benefits payable under the Plan in the event of a change in the Company's financial health.  To the extent any benefits provided under the Plan actually are paid from the trust, the Company shall have no further obligation with respect thereto, but to the
Grantor Trust.
extent not so paid, such benefits shall remain the obligation of, and shall be paid by, the Company.  Participants shall have the status of unsecured creditors on any legal claim for benefits under the Plan, and shall have no security interest in any such grantor trust.
                                               
11.03         The terms and conditions of this Plan shall inure to the benefit of the Participants and shall bind the Company, its successors, assignees, and personal representatives.  If substantially all of the stock or assets of the Company are acquired by another entity, or if the Company is merged into, or consolidated with, another entity, then the obligations created hereunder shall be obligations of the acquirer or successor entity.
Successors and Mergers, Consolidations or Change in Control.
                                               
11.04         Neither a Participant, nor any other person, shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate, or convey in advance of the actual receipt, any amounts payable hereunder, or any part thereof.  All rights to payments expressly are declared to be unassignable and nontransferable.  No part of the amounts payable, prior to actual payment, shall be subject to seizure or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant, or any other person, nor shall they be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant's, or any other person's, bankruptcy or insolvency.
Non-Assignability.
                                               
11.05         Nothing contained in this Plan, nor any action taken hereunder, shall be construed as a contract of employment, or as giving any Eligible Employee any right to be retained in the employ of the Company.  Designation as an Eligible Employee may be revoked at any time by the Company with respect to any compensation not yet deferred.
Employment or Future Eligibility to Participate Not Guaranteed.
                                               
11.06         A Participant will cooperate with the Company by furnishing any and all information requested by the Company in order to facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder, including taking such physical examinations as the Company reasonably may deem necessary and taking such other relevant action as may be requested by the Company.  If a Participant refuses to cooperate, the Participant's election

Notice.
                The Chubb Corporation has caused this Plan to be duly executed this          day of                         , 2005.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF,
 
                "Change in Control Event" shall mean the occurrence of a change in the ownership of The Chubb Corporation (the "Company") (as described in Section 1 below) and/or a change in the effective control of the Company (as described in Section 2 below) and/or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company (as described in Section 3 below).
 
                For purposes of Sections 1, 2 and 3 below, section 318(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), shall apply to determine stock ownership.  Stock underlying a vested option is considered owned by the individual who holds the vested option (and stock underlying an unvested option is not considered owned by the individual who holds the unvested option).  For purposes of the preceding sentence, however, if a vested option is exercisable for stock that is not substantially vested (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. 1.83-3(b) and (j)), the stock underlying the option is not treated as owned by the individual who holds the option.
                                               
1.     (a)       .  A change in the ownership of the Company occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as described in subsection (b) below), acquires ownership of stock of the Company that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company.  However, if any one person or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a change in the ownership of the Company (or to cause a change in the effective control of the Company (within the meaning of Section 2 below)).  An increase in the percentage of stock owned by any one person, or persons acting as a group, as a result of a transaction in which the Company acquires its stock in exchange for property will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this Section.  This Section applies only when there is a transfer of stock of the Company (or issuance of stock of the Company) and stock in the Company remains outstanding after the transaction (see Section 3 below for rules regarding the transfer of assets of the Company).
Change in the Ownership of the Company
                                               
        (b)       .  For purposes of subsection (a) above, persons will not be considered to be acting as a group solely because they purchase or own stock of the same corporation at the same time, or as a result of the same public offering.  However, persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar business transaction with the Company.  If a person, including an entity, owns stock in both corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in a corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation.
Persons Acting as a Group
                                               
        (c)         For purposes of determining stock ownership, see above.
Stock Ownership.
                                               
2.     (a)       .  Notwithstanding that the Company has not undergone a change in ownership under Section 1 above, a change in the effective control of the Company occurs on the date that either 
Change in the Effective Control of the Company
                                                                                                           
(i)        Any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as determined under subsection (d) below), acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of the Company possessing 35 percent or more of the total voting power of the stock of the Company; or
                                                                                                           
(ii)       A majority of the members of the Company's board of directors is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the
members of the Company's board of directors prior to the date of the appointment or election.
                                                                                                           
In the absence of an event described in paragraph (i) or (ii) above, a change in the effective control of the Company will not have occurred.
                                                                       
(b)       .  A change in effective control also may occur in any transaction in which either of the two companies involved in the transaction has a Change in Control under Section 1 above or Section 3 below.  Thus, for example, assume Corporation P transfers more than 40 percent of the total gross fair market value of its assets to Corporation O in exchange for 35 percent of O's stock.  P has undergone a change in ownership of a substantial portion of its assets under Section 3 below and O has a change in effective control under this Section.
Multiple Changes in Control
                                                                       
(c)       .  If any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to effectively control the Company (within the meaning of this Section), the acquisition of additional control of the Company by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a change in the effective control of the Company (or to cause a change in the ownership of the Company within the meaning of Section 1 above).
Acquisition of Additional Control
                                                                       
(d)       .  Persons will not be considered to be acting as a group solely because they purchase or own stock of the same corporation at the same time, or as a result of the same public offering.  However, persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar business transaction with the Company.  If a person, including an entity, owns stock in both corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in a corporation only with respect to the ownership in that corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation.
Persons Acting as a Group
                                                                       
(e)       .  For purposes of determining stock ownership, see above.
Stock Ownership
                                               
3.     (a)       .  A change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Company's assets occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as determined in subsection (c) below), acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 40 percent of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions.  For this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the assets of the Company, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.
Change in the Ownership of a Substantial Portion of the Company's Assets
                                                                       
(b)       .  There is no Change in Control under this Section when there is a transfer to an entity that is controlled by the shareholders of the transferring company immediately after the transfer, as provided in this subsection (b).  A transfer of assets by the Company is not treated as a change in the ownership of such assets if the assets are transferred to 
Transfers to a Related Person
                                                                                                           
(i)        A shareholder of the Company (immediately before the asset transfer) in exchange for or with respect to its stock;
                                                                                                           
(ii)       An entity, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company;
                                                                                                           
(iii)      A person, or more than one person acting as a group, that owns, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of the Company; or
                                                                                                           
(iv)      An entity, at least 50 percent of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person described in paragraph (iii) above.
                                                                                                     
For purposes of this subsection (b) and except as otherwise provided, a person's status is determined immediately after the transfer of the assets.  For example, a transfer to a company in which the transferor Company has no ownership interest before the transaction, but which is a majority-owned subsidiary of the transferor Company after the transaction is not treated as a change in the ownership of the assets of the transferor Company.
                                                                       
(c)       .  Persons will not be considered to be acting as a group solely because they purchase assets of the same corporation at the same time, or as a result of the same public offering.  However, persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of assets, or similar business transaction with the Company.  If a person, including an entity shareholder, owns stock in both corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in a corporation only to the extent of the ownership in that corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation.
Persons Acting as a Group

(a)
                                 
Performance Cycle
 
.  The Performance Goal for the Performance Cycle is the total return per share of Stock to the Corporation's shareholders, inclusive of dividends paid (regardless of whether paid in cash or property, which dividends shall be deemed reinvested in Stock), during the Performance Cycle in comparison to the total return per share of stock, inclusive of dividends paid (regardless of whether paid in cash or property, which dividends shall be deemed reinvested in stock) achieved by the companies () which are in the Standard & Poors 500 Index (the "") on the date the Performance Cycle begins and () which continue to file public reports pursuant to the Act for the entirety of the Performance Cycle (such companies, the "").

conclusion of the Performance Cycle will be a Comparison Company as long as it files public reports pursuant to the Act for the entire Performance Cycle (and any company first included in the S&P 500 after the start of the Performance Cycle will not be a Comparison Company).
 
.  Except as provided in Section 4, the Performance Shares covered by the Award shall be deemed earned based on where the Corporation's total shareholder return during the Performance Cycle ranks in relation to the total shareholder returns of the Comparison Companies during such period.  For purposes of calculating the total shareholder return of the Corporation and the Comparison Companies during the Performance Cycle, the value of each such company's stock at the beginning and end of the Performance Cycle shall be established based on the average of the averages of the high and low trading prices of the applicable stock on the principal exchange on which the stock trades for the 15 trading days occurring immediately prior to the beginning or end of the Performance Cycle, as the case may be.  Such averages for each such company (including the Corporation) shall be referred to herein as the "" and the "."  As soon as practicable after the completion of the Performance Cycle, the total shareholder returns of the Comparison Companies will be calculated and ranked from highest to lowest.  The Corporation's total shareholder return will then be ranked in terms of which percentile it would have placed in among the Comparison Companies.  In calculating the total shareholder return with respect to either the Corporation or any of the Comparison Companies, the Committee shall make or shall cause to be made such appropriate adjustments to the calculation of total shareholder return for such entity (including, without limitation, adjusting the Beginning Average Value) as shall be necessary or appropriate to avoid an artificial increase or decrease in such return as a result of a stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization or other similar event affecting the capital structure of such entity that does not involve the issuance of the entity's securities in exchange for money, property or other consideration.

  The extent to which Performance Shares shall become earned shall be determined according to the following schedule:
(d)
                                
Percentage of Performance Shares Earned.
 
To the extent that the Corporation's total shareholder return ranks in a percentile between the 25 and the 50 percentile, or between the 50 and the 85percentile, of comparative performance, then the number of Performance Shares earned shall be determined by multiplying the relative percentile of comparative performance achieved by the Corporation by two (e.g., if the Corporation's total shareholder return would have placed in the 40 percentile, then 80% of the Performance Shares covered by the Award become earned; if the Corporation's total shareholder return would have placed in the 75 percentile, then 150% of the Performance Shares covered by the Award become earned).
