Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     WARREN, N.J., April 25, 2005  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] today reported that net income in the first quarter of 2005 was $470 million, a 30% increase over net income of $361 million in the first quarter of 2004. Net income per share increased 26% to $2.37 from $1.88.
     Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, increased 43% to $440 million in the first quarter of 2005 from $308 million in the first quarter of 2004. Operating income per share grew 38% to a record $2.22 from $1.61 a year ago.
     Net written premiums for the first quarter increased 1% to $3.1 billion. Premiums for the insurance business grew 3%  up 1% in the U.S. and 7% outside the U.S. (3% in local currencies). Premiums for the reinsurance assumed business (Chubb Re) were down 12%.
     The combined loss and expense ratio for the first quarter was 89.4%, compared with 92.6% in the corresponding year-earlier quarter. In the first quarter of 2005, catastrophe losses for Chubb were $20 million and accounted for 0.6 points of the combined ratio. In the first quarter of 2004, catastrophe losses were $97 million and accounted for 3.5 points of the combined ratio. Excluding catastrophe losses, the first quarter combined ratio was 88.8% in 2005 and 89.1% in 2004. The expense ratio for the first quarter was 28.8% in 2005, compared with 30.1% in 2004.
Outlook for 2005
     "Chubb had an outstanding quarter, with the best combined ratio in more than 30 years," said John D. Finnegan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Highlighting the quarter were the continued excellent performance of our commercial insurance lines and ongoing significant improvement in homeowners insurance.
 
     "In a more competitive market environment, we have maintained underwriting discipline and strict expense vigilance in order to protect and enhance our profitability," said Mr. Finnegan. "This core strategy will continue to guide the company forward.
     "Our first-quarter results put us on the path to achieving or exceeding our operating earnings guidance of $7.60 to $8.00 per share for 2005," said Mr. Finnegan. Operating earnings guidance continues to assume 3 points of catastrophe losses for the year and to exclude results from the non-insurance business of Chubb Financial Solutions. "We are maintaining this outlook, as we have completed only one quarter, and we will revisit it when we have six months of operations behind us," said Mr. Finnegan.
Reporting Format Changes; No Impact on Results or Guidance
     Beginning with the first quarter of 2005, the reporting format for property and casualty underwriting results by line of business has been changed to more closely reflect the way the business is now managed. The new reporting format provides additional clarity in that all Professional Liability business is now reported in one line within Chubb Specialty Insurance, all commercial business is now reported in Chubb Commercial Insurance and Reinsurance Assumed (Chubb Re) is now reported as a separate business unit.
     The changes to the reporting format for the property and casualty underwriting lines of business are as follows:
     
Chubb Personal Insurance (CPI)
     
Chubb Commercial Insurance (CCI)
     
Chubb Specialty Insurance (CSI)
     
Reinsurance Assumed (Chubb Re)
 
     These reporting format changes do not have any impact on previously reported total property and casualty underwriting results.
     Property and casualty underwriting results for the years 2001 through 2004 have been reclassified to conform to the new reporting format and are posted on the Chubb website at .
www.chubb.com
     The reporting format changes have no impact on Chubb's 2005 operating income guidance provided last February or on the overall underlying assumptions of net written premium growth of 1% to 4%, a combined ratio of 91% to 93% and after-tax property and casualty investment income growth of 8% to 10%.
     With respect to the business units, there is no impact on the underlying premium growth and combined ratio assumptions for CPI and CCI. The assumptions for CSI have changed primarily because Reinsurance Assumed has been split from CSI into a separate business unit. Assumptions for 2005 for the reclassified business units are as follows:
     The assumptions for premium growth relate to the reclassified business unit results for 2004 that have been posted on the website.
     The guidance and related assumptions are subject to the risks outlined in the company's forward-looking information safe-harbor statements.
First Quarter Operations Review
     had net written premium growth of 5% and a combined ratio of 84.5%, compared to 97.5% in the first quarter of 2004. Catastrophes accounted for 1.4 percentage points of the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2005, compared to 10.2 points in the first quarter of 2004. Excluding catastrophe losses, the CPI combined ratio for the quarter was 83.1% in 2005 and 87.3% in 2004.
Chubb Personal Insurance
     Net written premiums for the Homeowners line grew 9%. The combined ratio was 80.6%, which included 2.6 percentage points of catastrophe losses. Personal Automobile premiums grew 1% and the combined ratio was 95.7%, while Other Personal lines, which include accident, excess liability and yacht insurance, had a 3% decline in premiums and a combined ratio of 86.8%.
     had a 2% increase in net written premiums and a combined ratio of 84.0% for the quarter, compared to 82.9% in the first quarter of 2004. CCI catastrophe losses in the first quarter accounted for 0.4 points of the combined ratio in 2005 and 1.9 points in 2004.
Chubb Commercial Insurance
 
     CCI's average renewal rates in the U.S. were flat, and it retained 84% of the U.S. premiums that came up for renewal. In the U.S., premiums from new accounts exceeded lost business by a 1.1-to-1 margin.
     net written premiums were up 1%, and the combined ratio was 105.0%, compared to 103.7% in the corresponding year-earlier quarter. The 1.3-point deterioration was the result of one $60 million Surety loss, partially offset by improvement in the Professional Liability business.
Chubb Specialty Insurance
     Surety premiums increased 9% in the first quarter, and the business had a combined ratio of 154.1%.
     Professional Liability net written premiums were up 1% in the first quarter, and the business had a combined ratio of 101.6%, a 5.7-point improvement over the first quarter of 2004. Average renewal rates in the U.S. were down 2%, and Chubb retained 85% of the U.S. premiums that came up for renewal. In the U.S., premiums from new accounts exceeded lost business by a 1.3-to-1 margin.
     net written premiums declined 12%, and the combined ratio was 88.0%, compared to 93.1% in the corresponding year-earlier quarter.
Reinsurance Assumed (Chubb Re)
     after taxes increased 14% to $252 million in the first quarter of 2005 from $222 million in the first quarter of 2004.

Definitions of Key Terms
Operating Income
Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax-exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
 
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
Book value per share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income, the after-tax appreciation or depreciation on the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at market value. The appreciation or depreciation on available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio
The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
