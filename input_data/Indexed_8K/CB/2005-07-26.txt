FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     WARREN, New Jersey, July 26, 2005 - The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB], a leading global property and casualty insurer, today reported that net income in the second quarter of 2005 was $496 million, a 39% increase over net income of $356 million in the second quarter of 2004. Net income per share increased 32% to $2.45 from $1.85.
     Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, increased 35% in the second quarter of 2005 to $461 million from $341 million in the second quarter of 2004. Operating income per share grew 29% to a record $2.28 from $1.77.
     Net written premiums for the second quarter increased 6% to $3.1 billion. Premiums for the insurance business grew 8%: up 7% in the U.S. and 13% outside the U.S. (8% in local currencies). Premiums for the reinsurance assumed business (Chubb Re) declined 14%.
     The combined loss and expense ratio for the second quarter was 88.3%, compared to 92.8% in the second quarter of 2004. Catastrophe losses for the 2005 second quarter were $21 million, accounting for 0.7 percentage points of the combined ratio. In the second quarter of 2004, catastrophe losses (excluding the release of $80 million of net reserves for losses related to the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center) were $46 million, representing 1.6 percentage points of the combined ratio. The expense ratio improved to 28.0% from 29.5%.
 
Property and casualty investment income after taxes for the second quarter increased 12% to $261 million from $232 million in 2004.
     "Chubb's outstanding second quarter results in personal insurance, commercial insurance and assumed reinsurance, coupled with the improvement in specialty insurance, are especially noteworthy in that they were achieved in a more competitive market environment," said John D. Finnegan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "This performance demonstrates the kind of results Chubb can achieve when we focus on our core businesses and execute our disciplined underwriting strategies."
Six Month Results
     For the first six months of 2005, net income was $965 million or $4.82 per share, compared with $717 million or $3.73 per share for the first half of 2004. Operating income totaled a record $902 million or $4.50 per share for the first half of 2005, compared with $649 million or $3.38 per share for the first half of 2004.
     Net written premiums for the first six months increased 4% to $6.2 billion. Premiums for the insurance business grew 5%: up 4% in the U.S. and 10% outside the U.S. (5% in local currencies). Premiums for the reinsurance assumed business (Chubb Re) declined 13%.
     The combined ratio for the first half was 88.9% in 2005 and 92.7% in 2004. Catastrophe losses for the first half of 2005 were $41 million, accounting for 0.7 percentage points of the combined ratio.

The first half expense ratio improved to 28.4% from 29.8%.
     Property and casualty investment income after taxes increased 13% to $514 million in the first half of 2005 from $454 million in the corresponding period a year earlier.
Outlook for 2005
     "In light of our strong first half results and our positive outlook for the second half, we are raising guidance for full year 2005 operating earnings per share to a range of $8.30 to $8.70," said Mr. Finnegan. The revised operating income guidance assumes 2 percentage points of catastrophe losses for the year. The company's previous guidance, provided on February 1, 2005, was $7.60 to $8.00 per share and assumed 3 percentage points of catastrophe losses for the year.
 
     Mr. Finnegan said the revised 2005 operating income guidance assumes:
Second Quarter Operations Review
     net written premiums grew 8% to $871 million. CPI's combined ratio improved to 81.0% from 89.6% in the second quarter of 2004, driven primarily by excellent results in Homeowners insurance. Catastrophe losses accounted for 1.5 percentage points of the second quarter combined ratio in 2005, compared with 4.9 points in 2004.
Chubb Personal Insurance
     The Homeowners line grew 10%. The combined ratio was 73.7%, which included 2.5 percentage points of catastrophe losses. Personal Automobile grew 3% and had a combined ratio of 95.2%, while Other Personal grew 7% and had a combined ratio of 91.6%.
     net written premiums grew 6% to $1.3 billion. The combined ratio was 86.7%, compared to 73.6% in the corresponding quarter of 2004. Excluding the $80 million September 11 net reserve release, CCI's combined ratio in the second quarter of 2004 was 80.5%. Second quarter catastrophe losses accounted for 0.9 percentage points of the combined ratio in 2005 and 0.8 points in 2004 excluding the September 11 reserve release.
Chubb Commercial Insurance
     Average renewal rates in the U.S. were down 1% for CCI, which retained 84% of the U.S. premiums that came up for renewal. In the U.S., premiums from new accounts exceeded lost business by a 1.2-to-1 margin.
     net written premiums grew 12% to $743 million. The combined ratio was 98.3%, compared with 128.6% in the second quarter of 2004.
Chubb Specialty Insurance
 
     Professional Liability (PL) net written premiums grew 12%, attributable largely to the company's decision not to renew a reinsurance treaty.

The 2004 results included $160 million of net reserve strengthening for errors & omissions losses related to investment banks.

Definitions of Key Terms
Operating Income
Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax-exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
Book value per common share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income, the after-tax appreciation or depreciation on the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at market value. The appreciation or depreciation on available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio
The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
