Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On August 11, 2005, The Chubb Corporation (the "Company") entered into a Remarketing Agreement (the "Agreement") with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as remarketing agents (the "Remarketing Agents") and JPMorgan Trust Company, N.A., not individually but solely as Warrant Agent, in connection with the anticipated remarketing of the Company's 4.00% Senior Notes due November 16, 2007 (the "Senior Notes"), originally issued as part of the 7.00% Equity Units (the "Equity Units") issued by the Company in November 2002.
 
The Agreement provides, among other things, that the Remarketing Agents will use their reasonable efforts to remarket the Senior Notes at a price approximately but not less than 100.50% of the purchase price (the "Purchase Price") of a specified portfolio of U.S. Treasury securities to be substituted for the Senior Notes as a component of the Equity Units.  The Remarketing Agents are entitled to a remarketing fee not exceeding an aggregate of 25 basis points (0.25%) of the Purchase Price.  The Company will not receive any proceeds from the remarketing of the Senior Notes.  The Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants by the Company concerning the Company and the registration statement relating to the remarketing.  It also provides that the Company will indemnify the Remarketing Agents against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, or to contribute payments the Remarketing Agents may be required to make because of any of those liabilities.
 
The Remarketing Agents and their respective affiliates have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, investment banking and commercial banking services to the Company and its affiliates for which they have received, or will receive, customary compensation.  On June 22, 2005, the Company entered into a $500 million five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions, including affiliates of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co., who will act as lenders or in certain agency capacities.  In addition, the Company has established a commercial paper issuance program in which affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. will act as dealers and in certain agency capacities.  Additionally, an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co. is a co-investor with the Company in Allied World Assurance Holdings, Ltd., an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated serves as the third-party administrator of the Company's equity compensation plans and John D. Finnegan, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, is a member of the Board of Directors of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. and serves on such Board's Management Development and Compensation Committee and its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
 
The foregoing description is qualified by reference to the Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

Indemnification.
Section 8.
             
 
The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Remarketing Agent, the partners, directors and officers of each Remarketing Agent and each person, if any, who controls any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Remarketing Agents or any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or any other Remarketing Materials, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or action as such expenses are incurred; that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent through the Representative specifically for use therein; and , that with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any Preliminary Prospectus the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Remarketing Agent from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Remarketed Senior Notes concerned, to the extent that a Preliminary Prospectus relating to such Remarketed Senior Notes was required to be delivered by such Remarketing Agent under the Securities Act in connection with such purchase and any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Remarketing Agent results from the fact that there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Remarketed Senior Notes to such person, a copy of the Prospectus, if any such untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission was corrected in the Prospectus and would have been cured by
(a)
          
provided
provided
further
delivery of such Prospectus and if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to such Remarketing Agent.
 
Each Remarketing Agent severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus supplement, or any other Remarketing Materials, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent through the Representative specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred.
(b)
          
 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above.  The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; and that the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof.  Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action and/or to assume the defense thereof, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel) (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with local counsel)), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those
(c)
          
provided,
provided further
available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party.  No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 8 or 9 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
Contribution.
Section 9.
             
 
If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or Section 8(b), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section 8(a) or Section 8(b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other from the offering of the Remarketed Senior Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other hand in connection with the Remarketing shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes less the Remarketing Fee paid to the Remarketing Agents on the one hand and the Remarketing Fee paid to the Remarketing Agents on the other hand bear to the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agents on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (a) were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (a) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
(a)
          
pro rata
investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (a), the Remarketing Agents shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the Remarketing Fee received by it under Section 3 exceeds the amount of any damages which the Remarketing Agents have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
 
The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of any Remarketing Agent and to each person, if any, who controls such Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of such Remarketing Agent under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which such Remarketing Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
(b)
          
 
The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in Section 8 and this Section 9 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent or any person controlling any Remarketing Agent, or the Company, its officers or director or any controlling person of the Company, and the completion of the Remarketing.
(c)
          
 
Resignation and Removal of the Remarketing Agents.
Section 10.
           
 
Any Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove a Remarketing Agent, by giving 30 days' prior written notice, in the case of a resignation, to the Company and the Depositary and, in the case of a removal, to the removed Remarketing Agent and the Depositary; that:
provided
 
a Remarketing Agent may not resign without reasonable cause; and
(a)
          
 
no such resignation nor any such removal shall become effective unless there is at least one remaining Remarketing Agent or if there is no remaining Remarketing Agent, until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor Remarketing Agent and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Company, in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Transaction Documents in all material respects.
(b)
          
 
If there is no remaining Remarketing Agent, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent and enter into such a remarketing agreement with such person as soon as reasonably practicable.  The provisions of Section 8, Section 9 and Section 12 shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
Dealing in Securities.
Section 11.
           
 
Each Remarketing Agent, when acting as Remarketing Agent or in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold and deal in any of the Remarketed Senior Notes, Corporate Units, Treasury Units or any of the securities of the Company (together, the "").  The Remarketing Agents may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of such Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.  Each Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.

A Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketed Senior Notes in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from its failure to comply with the material terms of this Agreement or the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part.  The provisions of this Section 12 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
