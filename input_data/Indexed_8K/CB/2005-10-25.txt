Exhibit 99.1
     WARREN, New Jersey, October 25, 2005  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB], a leading global property and casualty insurer, today reported that net income in the third quarter of 2005 was $246 million, or $1.20 per share, compared to $364 million, or $1.88 per share, in the third quarter of 2004.
     Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, was $183 million, or $0.89 per share, in the third quarter of 2005 and $332 million, or $1.72 per share, in the third quarter of 2004.
     Chubb's results for the third quarter of 2005 were adversely affected by pre-tax costs of $511 million, or $1.62 per share after-tax, related to Hurricane Katrina. This amount includes estimated net losses of $415 million, net reinsurance reinstatement premium costs of $51 million and a $45 million charge representing Chubb's share of the losses estimated by Allied World Assurance Company, Ltd. related to the hurricane. Other catastrophe losses during the third quarter amounted to $57 million  including an estimated $25 million for Hurricane Rita  bringing the total pre-tax impact of catastrophes in the third quarter to $568 million. Chubb noted that its completion of inspections of additional properties affected by Katrina resulted in a downward revision of the company's estimate of third quarter catastrophe costs from the $600 million pre-tax amount which was announced on October 6.
 
     "Despite the $1.62 per share impact of Katrina," said John D. Finnegan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, "Chubb was able to produce $0.89 per share of operating income in the third quarter, demonstrating the underlying strength of our businesses."
     Net written premiums for the third quarter were $3.0 billion, similar to the third quarter of 2004. Excluding the impact of net reinstatement premium costs related to Katrina, net written premiums increased 1%. Premiums for the insurance business increased 1%. Excluding $102 million of Katrina-related reinstatement premium costs, insurance premiums grew 5%  up 5% in the U.S. and 5% outside the U.S. (1% in local currencies). Premiums for the reinsurance assumed business (Chubb Re) declined 14%; excluding $51 million of reinstatement premium revenues, premiums declined 31%.
     The combined loss and expense ratio for the third quarter was 102.2% in 2005 and 93.3% in 2004. The impact of catastrophes on the 2005 third quarter underwriting results was $523 million, including the $51 million of net reinstatement premium costs and $415 million of net losses from Katrina, as well as $57 million of other catastrophe losses. The aggregate impact of all catastrophes represented 17.0 percentage points of the third quarter's combined ratio. In the third quarter of 2004, catastrophe losses were $196 million, representing 6.7 points of the combined ratio.
     The third quarter expense ratio improved to 27.8% in 2005 from 29.4% a year earlier.
     Property and casualty investment income after taxes for the third quarter increased 10% to $267 million in 2005 from $242 million in 2004.
Nine Month Results
     For the first nine months of 2005, net income was $1.2 billion, or $6.00 per share, compared with $1.1 billion, or $5.61 per share, for the first nine months of 2004. Operating income totaled $1.1 billion, or $5.37 per share, for the first nine months of 2005, compared with $981 million, or $5.10 per share, for the first nine months of 2004.
     Net written premiums for the first nine months increased 2% to $9.2 billion. Premiums for the insurance business grew 4%. Premiums for the reinsurance assumed business declined 13%. Excluding the impact of net reinsurance reinstatement premiums related to Katrina: Chubb's total premiums grew 3%; premiums for the insurance business grew 5%  up 4% in the U.S. and up 8% outside the U.S. (4% in local currencies); and premiums for the reinsurance assumed business declined 19%.
 
     The combined ratio for the first nine months was 93.3% in 2005 and 92.9% in 2004. The impact of catastrophes on underwriting results for the first nine months of 2005 was to reduce premiums by $51 million and increase losses by $513 million. The aggregate impact accounted for 6.1 percentage points of the combined ratio. In the first nine months of 2004, catastrophe losses were $259 million, representing 3.0 percentage points of the combined ratio. This included the release in the second quarter of 2004 of $80 million of net reserves for losses related to the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center.
     The expense ratio for the first nine months improved to 28.2% in 2005 from 29.7% in 2004.
     Property and casualty investment income after taxes increased 12% to $780 million in the first nine months of 2005 from $696 million in the corresponding period a year earlier.
Outlook for 2005
     "Chubb's year-to-date operating income of $5.37 per share was the highest in the company's history for the first nine months," said Mr. Finnegan. "Based on our expectations for a strong fourth quarter, we now estimate that our full-year 2005 operating income per share will be in the range of $7.30 to $7.80. Due to the uncertainty at this time of the impact of Hurricane Wilma and October rainstorms in the Northeastern United States, this estimate assumes a range of 3 to 6 percentage points of fourth quarter catastrophe losses."
     In July, before Katrina, Chubb had estimated its 2005 operating income per share at $8.30 to $8.70. In 2004, operating income per share was $7.26.

     (CPI) net written premiums grew 6% to $860 million. Excluding the impact of reinstatement premium costs related to Katrina, premiums grew 8%. CPI's combined ratio was 94.3%, compared to 100.6% in the third quarter of 2004. The impact of third quarter catastrophes accounted for 15.4 percentage points of the combined ratio in 2005, compared with 17.1 points in 2004. Excluding the impact of catastrophes in both years, the third quarter combined ratio was 78.9% in 2005 and 83.5% in 2004.

Definitions of Key Terms
Operating Income
Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax-exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
Book value per common share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income, the after-tax appreciation or depreciation on the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at market value. The appreciation or depreciation on available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio
The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
