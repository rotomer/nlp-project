FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     WARREN, New Jersey, January 31, 2006  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] today reported that net income in the fourth quarter of 2005 was $614 million or $2.92 per share, compared to $468 million or $2.39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2004.
     Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, increased to a record $493 million from $421 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Operating income per share increased 9% to $2.34 from $2.15.
     Net written premiums for the fourth quarter increased 1% to $3.1 billion. Premiums for the insurance business grew 5%: 4% in the U.S. and 9% outside the U.S. (10% in local currencies). Premium growth in the insurance business units other than Chubb Personal Insurance was attributable to Chubb's decision not to renew certain reinsurance treaties, resulting in less premium ceded to reinsurers. Premiums for the Reinsurance Assumed business declined 41%.
     The fourth quarter combined loss and expense ratio was 89.3% in 2005 and 90.6% in 2004. The impact of catastrophes for the quarter accounted for 4.0 percentage points of the combined ratio in 2005, compared to 0.4 points in 2004. The expense ratio for the fourth quarter was 27.5% in 2005 and 27.9% in 2004.
     Property and casualty investment income after taxes for the fourth quarter increased 9% to $276 million in 2005 from $254 million in 2004.
 
     During the fourth quarter of 2005, Chubb repurchased 1,393,900 shares of its common stock at a total cost of $135 million.
     "We are delighted with the continued excellent results at Chubb Personal Insurance and Chubb Commercial Insurance and the substantial improvement at Chubb Specialty Insurance," said John D. Finnegan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Chubb. "With all three insurance business units now making significant profit contributions, Chubb achieved its third consecutive year of record operating earnings despite unusually high catastrophe losses. In addition, the completion of the Chubb Re  Harbor Point transaction on December 15 resulted in a $171 million pre-tax realized investment gain in the fourth quarter. We believe this transaction will bring significant additional value to Chubb shareholders in the future."
Full Year Results
     For the year ended December 31, 2005, net income was $1.8 billion or $8.94 per share, compared with $1.5 billion or $8.01 per share for the year ended December 31, 2004. Operating income for 2005 totaled a record $1.6 billion or $7.73 per share, compared with $1.4 billion or $7.26 per share in 2004.
     Net written premiums in 2005 increased 2% to $12.3 billion. Premiums for the insurance business grew 4%: 3% in the U.S. and 8% outside the U.S. (6% in local currencies). Premiums for the Reinsurance Assumed business declined 21%.
     The combined ratio in 2005 was 92.3%, the same as in 2004. The impact of catastrophes accounted for 5.6 percentage points of the combined ratio in 2005. In 2004, catastrophe losses accounted for 2.3 points, which reflected the release in the second quarter of $80 million of net reserves for losses related to the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. The expense ratio for the year was 28.0% in 2005 and 29.2% in 2004.
     Property and casualty investment income after taxes increased 11% to $1.1 billion in 2005 from $949 million in 2004.

Chubb Commercial Insurance

Reinsurance Assumed
2006 Operating Income Guidance
     "We expect our earnings momentum of the past three years to continue in 2006," said Mr. Finnegan. "We believe we can achieve 2006 operating income per share in the range of $8.60 to $9.00. This guidance assumes 4 percentage points of catastrophe losses, in contrast to the guidance assumption of 3 points at the beginning of last year and previous years."
     Mr. Finnegan said the operating income guidance for 2006 also assumes:
     "The markets for insurance and reinsurance are still in post-Katrina transition," said Mr. Finnegan, "so we are not providing premium growth assumptions by business unit for 2006. For the purposes of planning and budgeting as well as developing our earnings guidance, we have assumed overall growth in our insurance business in the low single digits. Premiums for the Reinsurance Assumed business will continue to decline following the Harbor Point transaction."
     The guidance and related assumptions are subject to the risks outlined in the company's forward-looking information safe-harbor statement (see below).

Definitions of Key Terms
Operating Income
Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax-exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
Book value per common share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income, the after-tax appreciation or depreciation on the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at market value. The appreciation or depreciation on available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio
The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.

THE CHUBB CORPORATION
Beginning with the first quarter of 2005, the reporting format for property and casualty underwriting results by line of business has been changed to more closely reflect the way the business is now managed. The new reporting format provides additional clarity in that all Professional Liability business is now reported in one line within Chubb Specialty Insurance, all commercial business is now reported in Chubb Commercial Insurance and Reinsurance Assumed (Chubb Re) is now reported as a separate business unit.

As of December 31, 2005, 12,606,100 shares remained under the current share repurchase authorization.
