The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Remarketing Agent, the partners, directors and officers of each Remarketing Agent and each person, if any, who controls any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Remarketing Agents or any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement,
(a)
         
the Prospectus, or any amendments or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or the Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Company Information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any other Remarketing Materials, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or action as such expenses are incurred; that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent through the Representative specifically for use therein.
provided
 
Each Remarketing Agent severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or Preliminary Prospectus supplement, the Time of Sale Information or any other Remarketing Materials, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent through the Representative specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred.
(b)
        
 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; and that the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by
(c)
         
provided,
provided further
written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action and/or to assume the defense thereof, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel) (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with local counsel)), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 9 or 10 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
Contribution.
Section 10.
                                  
 
If the indemnification provided for in Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 9(a) or Section 9(b), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section 9(a) or Section 9(b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other from the offering of the Remarketed Senior Notes or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other hand in connection with the Remarketing shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes less the Remarketing Fee paid to the Remarketing Agents on the one hand and the Remarketing Fee paid to the Remarketing Agents
(a)
         
on the other hand bear to the aggregate principal amount of the Remarketed Senior Notes. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agents on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (a) were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (a) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (a), the Remarketing Agents shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the Remarketing Fee received by it under Section 3 exceeds the amount of any damages which the Remarketing Agents have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
pro rata
 
The obligations of the Company under this Section 10 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of any Remarketing Agent and to each person, if any, who controls such Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Securities Act; and the obligations of such Remarketing Agent under this Section 10 shall be in addition to any liability which such Remarketing Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act.
(b)
        
 
The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in Section 9 and this Section 10 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent or any person controlling any Remarketing Agent, or the Company, its officers or director or any controlling person of the Company, and the completion of the Remarketing.
(c)

a Remarketing Agent may not resign without reasonable cause; and
(a)
         
no such resignation nor any such removal shall become effective unless there is at least one remaining Remarketing Agent or if there is no remaining Remarketing Agent, until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor Remarketing Agent and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Company, in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Transaction Documents in all material respects.
(b)
        
 
If there is no remaining Remarketing Agent, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent and enter into such a remarketing agreement with such person as soon as reasonably practicable. The provisions of Section 9, Section 10 and Section 13 shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
 
Dealing in Securities.
Section 12.

The Remarketing Agents may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of such Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. Each Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.

Each Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties except as otherwise set forth herein. A Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder of Remarketed Senior Notes in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from its failure to comply with the material terms of this Agreement or the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part. The provisions of this Section 13 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall survive the resignation or removal of any Remarketing Agent pursuant to this Agreement.
 
Termination.
Section 14.
