Premiums for the insurance business were flat; they declined 2% in the U.S. and grew 6% outside the U.S. (1% in local currencies). Premiums for the reinsurance assumed business declined 67%, reflecting the impact of the Chubb Re-Harbor Point transaction completed in December 2005.
     The fourth quarter combined loss and expense ratio improved to 83.1% in 2006 from 89.3% in 2005. The impact of catastrophes in the fourth quarter of 2006 accounted for 0.9 percentage points of the combined ratio, compared to 4.0 points in the fourth quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the combined ratio improved 3.1 percentage points to 82.2% from 85.3%. The expense ratio for the fourth quarter was 29.9% in 2006 and 27.5% in 2005.

2007 Operating Income Guidance
     "Based on our current outlook," said Mr. Finnegan, "we believe we can achieve 2007 operating income per share in the range of $5.00 to $5.40." This guidance assumes a 4 percentage point impact of catastrophe losses on the 2007 combined ratio. For comparison purposes, the impact of catastrophe losses on the 2006 combined ratio was 1.4 points. The impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses on annual operating income per share is approximately $0.19.
     "The $0.40 reduction in operating income per share that is implied in the midpoint of our guidance for 2007 ($5.20 guidance midpoint for 2007 vs. $5.60 actual in 2006) is more than accounted for by our assumption of higher catastrophe losses in 2007," said Mr. Finnegan. "Specifically, the $0.76 per share impact of our 4 point catastrophe assumption for 2007 is $0.52 more than the actual $0.24 per share impact of catastrophe losses in 2006."
     Mr. Finnegan said the operating income guidance for 2007 also assumes:
 
     The guidance and related assumptions are subject to the risks outlined in the company's forward-looking information safe-harbor statements (see below).

Definitions of Key Terms
Operating Income
Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is measured based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax-exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
Book value per common share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income, the after-tax appreciation or depreciation on the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at market value. The appreciation or depreciation on available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio
The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
