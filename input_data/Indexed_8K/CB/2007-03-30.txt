          (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the partners, directors and officers of each Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Underwriters or any of them may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or the Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or action as such expenses are incurred; that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an
provided
 
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein.
          (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or the Time of Sale Information, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred.
          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; and that the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action and/or to assume the defense thereof, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel) (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with local counsel)), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties,
provided
however
provided further
 
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 8 or Section 9 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
          
Section 9. Contribution.
          (a) If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8 (a) or Section 8 (b), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section 8 (a) and Section 8 (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the aggregate principal amount of the Securities less the fee paid to the Underwriters on the one hand and the fee paid to the Underwriters on the other hand bear to the aggregate principal amount of the Securities. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (a) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (a) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (a), the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the fee received by it pursuant to Schedule I exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriters have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
          (b) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of any Underwriter and to each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of such Underwriter under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which such Underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
          (c) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in Section 8 and this Section 9 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter, or the Company, its officers or director or any controlling person of the Company, and the completion of the offer, sale and delivery of the Securities.
          
Section 10. Default by an Underwriter.
          (a) If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but (unless a substitute purchaser is obtained pursuant to clause (b) below) shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company.
          (b) In the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto and the nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities that the defaulting Underwriter failed to purchase, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for another party or other parties to purchase such otherwise unpurchased Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties to whom the Representatives do not reasonably object to purchase such Securities on such terms. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement.
          (c) In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 10, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
          
Section 11. Termination.
          This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such delivery and payment (i) trading in the Company's common stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iii)
 
there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering and sale or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
          
Section 12. Notices.
          All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and:

Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.

At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication.

Procedures
 
may authorize authentication and delivery pursuant to oral instructions of the Company or a duly authorized agent, which instructions shall be promptly confirmed in writing.

     (a) A Company Order requesting the Trustee's authentication and delivery of all or a portion of the Securities of such series, and if less than all, setting forth procedures for such authentication;
     (b) The Board Resolution by or pursuant to which such form of Security has been approved, and the Board Resolution, if any, by or pursuant to which the terms of the Securities of such series have been approved, and, if pursuant to a Board Resolution, an Officers' Certificate describing the action taken;

     Section 304
Temporary Securities.
     Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities of such series in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
     If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of such series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities, the temporary Securities shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities upon surrender of the temporary Securities at the office or agency of the Company designated for that purpose without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations having the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and having the same terms as such temporary Securities. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities.
     Section 305
Registration, Transfer and Exchange.
     The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. Such register is herein sometimes referred to as the "Securities Register." Unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture or Board Resolution adopted pursuant to Section 301 establishing the terms of the Securities of any series, the Trustee is hereby appointed "Securities Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.
     Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security at the office or agency of the Company designated for that purpose the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount, of the same original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and having the same terms.
 
     At the option of the Holder, Securities may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount, of the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and having the same terms, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
     All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
     Every Security presented or surrendered for registration, transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Securities Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Securities Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
     No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Securities.
     Unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture or Board Resolution adopted pursuant to Section 301 establishing the terms of the Securities of any series, notwithstanding any of the foregoing, any Global Security of a series shall be exchangeable pursuant to this Section 305 for Securities registered in the names of Persons other than the Depositary for such Security or its nominee only if (i) such Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or if at any time such Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (ii) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that such Global Security shall be so exchangeable or (iii) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of such series. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Securities registered in such names as such Depositary shall direct.
     Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, a Global Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary with respect to such Global Security to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary.
     Unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture or Board Resolution adopted pursuant to Section 301 establishing the terms of the Securities of any series, neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be required, pursuant to the provisions of this Section, (a) to issue, transfer or exchange any Security of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of selection for
 
redemption of Securities pursuant to Article Eleven and ending at the close of business on the day of mailing of notice of redemption or (b) to transfer or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, any portion thereof not to be redeemed.
     Section 306
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
     If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee together with such security or indemnity as may be required by the Company or the Trustee to save each of them harmless, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same issue and series of like tenor and principal amount, having the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and bearing the same Interest Rate as such mutilated Security, and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     If there shall be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the issuing Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same issue and series of like tenor and principal amount, having the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and bearing the same Interest Rate as such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
     In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
     Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
     Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.
     The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
 
     Section 307
Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
     Unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture or Board Resolution adopted pursuant to Section 301 establishing the terms of the Securities of any series, interest on any Security of any series which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date, shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest in respect of Securities of such series, except that, unless otherwise provided in the Securities of such series, interest payable on the Stated Maturity of a Security shall be paid to the Person to whom principal is paid. The initial payment of interest on any Security of any series which is issued between a Regular Record Date and the related Interest Payment Date shall be payable as provided in such Security or in the supplemental indenture or Board Resolution pursuant to Section 301 with respect to the related series of Securities.
     Unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture or Board Resolution adopted pursuant to Section 301 establishing the terms of the Securities of any series, any interest on any Security which is payable, but is not timely paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for Securities of such series (herein called "Defaulted Interest"), shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:
     (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series in respect of which interest is in default (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first class, postage prepaid, to each Holder of a Security of such series at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Securities Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. The Trustee may, in its discretion, in the name and at the expense of the Company, cause a similar notice to be published at
 
least once in a newspaper, customarily published in the English language on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, but such publication shall not be a condition precedent to the establishment of such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).
     (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of the series in respect of which interest is in default may be listed and, upon such notice as may be required by such exchange (or by the Trustee if the Securities are not listed), if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
     Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
     Section 308
Persons Deemed Owners.
     The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and (subject to Section 307) interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     Section 309
Cancellation.
     All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, transfer or exchange or for credit against any payment in respect of a sinking or analogous fund, or for conversion shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee, and any such Securities and Securities surrendered directly to the Trustee for any such purpose shall be promptly canceled by it. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities canceled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All canceled Securities shall be destroyed by the Trustee and, upon request, the Trustee shall deliver to the Company a certificate of such destruction.
 
     Section 310

     Section 401
Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
     Unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture or Board Resolution adopted pursuant to Section 301 establishing the terms of the Securities of any series, this Indenture shall cease to be of further effect with regard to the Securities of a series (except as to (i) any surviving rights of transfer, substitution and exchange of Securities, (ii) rights hereunder of Holders to receive payments of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities and other rights, duties and obligations of the Holders as beneficiaries hereof with respect to the amounts, if any, so deposited with the Trustee and (iii) the rights and obligations of the Trustee hereunder), and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when
     (1) either
     (A) all Securities of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered (other than (i) Securities of such series which have been destroyed, lost or stolen and which have been replaced or paid as provided in Section 306 and (ii) Securities of such series for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the Company or discharged from such trust, as provided in Section 1003) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or
     (B) all Securities of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
     (i) have become due and payable, or
     (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year of the date of deposit, or
     (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of such notice of redemption, and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for such purpose an amount in the currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are
 
payable or Government Obligations in an amount as will, together with predetermined and certain income to accrue thereon, without consideration of any reinvestment thereof, be sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest) to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity;
     (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company; and
     (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with.
     Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 607 and, if money shall have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of clause (1) of this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of Section 1003 shall survive.
     Section 402
Application of Trust Money.
     Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money or Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 or Section 403, or received by the Trustee in respect of Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 or Section 403, shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium, if any) and interest for whose payment such money or obligations have been deposited with or received by the Trustee; provided, however, such moneys need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
     Section 403
Satisfaction, Discharge and Defeasance of Securities of Any Series.
     Unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture or Board Resolution adopted pursuant to Section 301 establishing the terms of the Securities of any series, the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness on all the Outstanding Securities of any such series and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of such indebtedness, when
     (1) with respect to all Outstanding Securities of such series,
 
     (A) the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for such purpose money in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on all Outstanding Securities of such series for principal (and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest) to the Stated Maturity or any Redemption Date as contemplated by the penultimate paragraph of this Section 403, as the case may be; or
     (B) the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the Trustee as obligations in trust for such purpose (i) an amount of Government Obligations as will, or (ii) a combination of money and Government Obligations as will, together with predetermined and certain income to accrue thereon, without consideration of any reinvestment thereof, be sufficient to pay and discharge when due the entire indebtedness on all Outstanding Securities of such series for principal (and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest) to the Stated Maturity or any Redemption Date as contemplated by the penultimate paragraph of this Section 403, as the case may be; and
     (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series; and
     (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating to the defeasance of the entire indebtedness on all Outstanding Securities of any such series have been complied with.
     Any deposits with the Trustee referred to in Section 403(1) above shall be irrevocable and shall be made under the terms of a supplemental indenture or escrow trust agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee. If any Outstanding Securities of such series are to be redeemed prior to their Stated Maturity, whether pursuant to any optional redemption provisions or in accordance with any mandatory sinking fund requirement, the applicable escrow trust agreement shall provide therefor and the Company shall make such arrangements as are satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company. If the Securities of such series are not to become due and payable at their Stated Maturity or upon call for redemption within one year of the date of deposit, then the Company shall give, not later than the date of such deposit, notice of such deposit to the Holders of Securities of such series.
     Upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Section with respect to all the Outstanding Securities of any series, the terms and conditions of such series, including the terms and conditions with respect thereto set forth in this Indenture, shall no longer be binding upon, or applicable to, the Company except as to any surviving rights of transfer, substitution and exchange of Securities and provided, that the Company shall not be discharged from any payment obligations in respect of Securities of such series
 
which are deemed not to be Outstanding under clause (iii) of the definition thereof if such obligations continue to be valid obligations of the Company under applicable law.
     Section 501

     "Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to the Securities of any series, unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture or Board Resolution adopted pursuant to Section 301 establishing the terms of the Securities of any series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
     (1) default in the payment of any installment of interest upon any of the Securities of such series, including any Additional Interest in respect thereof, as and when the same shall become due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or
     (2) default in the payment of all or any part of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any of the Securities of such series as and when the same shall become due and payable either at maturity, upon redemption, by declaration or otherwise; or
     (3) default in the payment of any sinking fund installment as and when the same shall become due and payable by the terms of the Securities of such series; or
     (4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of the Company in respect of the Securities of such series (other than a covenant or warranty in respect of the Securities of such series a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of the series affected thereby, a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or
     (5) a court having jurisdiction in the premises shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or a decree or order adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization assignment, adjustment or composition of, as in respect of, the Company under
 
any applicable federal or state law or appointing a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee or sequestrator (or similar official) of the Company or for any substantial part of its property or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and such decree or order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 30 consecutive days; or
     (6) the Company shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or any other case to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or consent to the filing of such petition or to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable state or federal law, or consent to the filing of such petition or the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee or sequestrator (or similar official) of the Company or for any substantial part of its property, or make any general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action in furtherance of such bankruptcy; or
     (7) any other Event of Default established pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities for such series.
     Section 502
Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
     Unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture or Board Resolution adopted pursuant to Section 301 establishing the terms of the Securities of any series, if an Event of Default described in clauses (1), (2), (3), (4) (if the Event of Default under clause (4) is with respect to less than all series of Securities then Outstanding) or (7) above occurs and is continuing, then, and in each and every such case, unless the principal of all of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding hereunder (each such series voting as a separate class) by notice in writing to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if given by Holders of Securities), may declare the entire principal (or, if the Securities of such series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of such series) of all Securities of such series and the interest accrued thereon, if any, to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become immediately due and payable, provided that the payment of principal and interest (including any Additional Interest) on such Securities shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in Article Thirteen.
     Unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture or Board Resolution adopted pursuant to Section 301 establishing the terms of the Securities of any series, if an Event of Default described in clause (4) (if the Event of Default under clause (4) is with respect to all series of Securities then Outstanding), (5) or (6) occurs and is continuing, then and in each and every such case, unless the principal of all the Securities
 
shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of all the Securities of all series then Outstanding hereunder (treated as one class), by notice in writing to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if given by Holders of Securities), may declare the entire principal (or, if any Securities are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal as may be specified in the terms thereof) of all the Securities of all series then outstanding and interest accrued thereon, if any, to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become immediately due and payable, provided that the payment of principal and interest (including any Additional Interest) on such Securities shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in Article Thirteen.
     At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to Securities of any series or Securities of all series, as applicable, has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, or the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of all series, as applicable, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
     (1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay
     (A) all overdue installments of interest (including any Additional Interest) on all Securities of the affected series,
     (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of the affected series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by such Securities,
     (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Securities of the affected series, and
     (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
     (2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of the affected series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of the affected series which has become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
     No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     Upon receipt by the Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, with respect to Securities of a series all or part of which
 
is represented by a Global Security, a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day which is 90 days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice which has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 502.
     Section 503
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
     The Company covenants that if:
     (1) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest (including any Additional Interest) on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
     (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof,
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal, including any sinking fund payment or analogous obligations (and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest), including, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be lawful, interest on any overdue principal (and premium if any) and on any overdue installments of interest (including any Additional Interest) at the rate borne by the Securities; and, in addition thereto, all amounts owing the Trustee under Section 607.
     If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities, wherever situated.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and
 
the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
     Section 504
Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
     In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their creditors,
     (a) the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities of any series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal (and premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest)) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,
     (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal (and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest) owing and unpaid in respect to the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable and to take any and all actions as are authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have the claims of the Holders and any predecessor to the Trustee under Section 607 and of the Holders allowed in any such judicial proceedings; and
     (ii) and in particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same in accordance with Section 506; and
     (b) any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee for distribution in accordance with Section 506, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it and any predecessor Trustee under Section 607.
     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
 
     Section 505
Trustee May Enforce Claim Without Possession of Securities.
     All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of all the amounts owing the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 607, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
     Section 506
Application of Money Collected.
     Any money or property collected or to be applied by the Trustee with respect to a series of Securities pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money or property on account of principal (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest), upon presentation of the Securities of such series and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
     FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 607 with respect to the Securities of such series;
     SECOND: In case the principal of the Securities of such series in respect of which such money has been collected shall not have become and be then due and payable, to the payment of the interest (including any Additional Interest) on the Securities in order of the maturity of the installments of such interest, ratably, according to the amounts due and payable on such series of Securities for such interest;
     THIRD: In case the principal of the Securities of such series in respect of which such money has been collected shall have become and shall be then due and payable, to the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon such series of Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest), in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such series of Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest), respectively; and
     FOURTH: The balance, if any, to the Company or any other Person or Persons entitled thereto.
     Section 507
Limitation on Suits.
     No Holder of any Securities of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar official) or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:
 
     (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series;
     (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
     (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;
     (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and
     (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;
it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Holders of Securities, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such Holders.
     Section 508
Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and Interest.
     Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any Security shall have the right which is absolute and unconditional to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Section 307) interest (including any Additional Interest) on such Security on the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.
     Section 509
Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
     If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
 
     Section 510
Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
     Except as otherwise provided in the last paragraph of Section 507, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
     Section 511
Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
     Except as otherwise provided in the last paragraph of Section 507, no delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Security to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.
     Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.
     Section 512
Control by Holders.
     The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of such series, provided that:
     (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture,
     (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction, and
     (3) subject to the provisions of Section 601, the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow such direction if the Trustee in good faith shall, by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, determine that the proceeding so directed would be unjustly prejudicial to the Holders of Securities of such series not joining in any such direction or would involve the Trustee in personal liability.
     Upon receipt by the Trustee of any written notice directing the time, method or place of conducting any such proceeding or exercising any such trust or power, with respect to Securities of a series all or part of which is represented by a Global Security, a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice,
 
whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, that, unless the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall have joined in such notice prior to the day which is 90 days after such record date, such notice shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new notice identical to a notice which has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 512.
     Section 513
Waiver of Past Defaults.
     Unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture or Board Resolution adopted pursuant to Section 301 establishing the terms of the Securities of any series, prior to the declaration of the acceleration of the maturity of the Securities of any series as provided in Section 502, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series waive any past default with respect to such series specified in clauses (4) (if the default specified in clause (4) relates to less than all series of Securities then outstanding) or (7) of Section 501 (each series voting as a separate class), and, in the case of an event specified in clauses (4) (if the default specified in clause (4) relates to all series of Outstanding Securities), (5) or (6) of Section 501, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all Outstanding Securities of all series (voting as one class) may waive any such default hereunder with respect to all such series, except, in each case, a default:
     (1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest) or sinking fund installment on any Security of such series, or
     (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.
     Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     Section 514
Undertaking for Costs.
     All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys'
 
fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest) on any Security on or after the respective Stated Maturities expressed in such Security.

Certain Duties and Responsibilities.

     (1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
     (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.
     (b) In case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

     (d) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
     (e) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
     Section 602

     (e) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction;
     (f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, indenture, security or other paper or document, but the Trustee in its discretion may make such inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney; and

Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.
     The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company of the Securities or the proceeds thereof.
 
     Section 605
May Hold Securities.
     The Trustee, any Paying Agent, Securities Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Sections 608 and 613, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Paying Agent, Securities Registrar or such other agent.
     Section 606
Money Held in Trust.
     Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed with the Company.
     Section 607
Compensation and Reimbursement.
     The Company agrees
     (1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder in such amounts as the Company and the Trustee shall agree from time to time (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);
     (2) to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and

This indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee, and the defeasance or termination of this Indenture.
     To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section, the Company and the Holders agree that the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee. Such lien shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.
 
     When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default specified in Section 501(5) or 501(6) occurs, the expenses and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 or a successor statute.

Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.
     The Trustee for the Securities of any series issued hereunder shall be subject to the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.

     (e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series.

with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
     (c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

     Any Person into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such Person shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated, and in case any Securities shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor Trustee or in the name of such successor Trustee, and in all cases the certificate of authentication shall have the full force which it is provided anywhere in the Securities or in this Indenture that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.
     Section 613

     Section 614
Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
     The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue and upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a
 
corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, or of any State, Territory or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
     Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent shall be the successor Authenticating Agent hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
     An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give notice of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 106 to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provision of this Section.
     The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.
     If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:
     This is one of the Securities referred to in the within mentioned Indenture.

The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 701 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.
     (b) The rights of Holders to communicate with other Holders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Securities, and the corresponding rights and privileges of the Trustee, shall be as provided in the Trust Indenture Act.
     (c) Every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of information as to the names and addresses of the Holders made pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act.

     (8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 611(b); or
     (9) to comply with the requirements of the Commission in order to effect or maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act.
     Section 902
Supplemental Indentures with Consent of Holders.
     With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series affected by such supplemental indenture, by Act of said Holders delivered to the Company and the Trustee, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series under this Indenture; provided, however, that, unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture or Board Resolution adopted pursuant to Section 301 establishing the terms of the Securities of any series, no such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby,
     (1) except to the extent permitted by Section 311 with respect to the extension of the interest payment period of the Securities of any series, change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest (including any Additional Interest) on, any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or reduce the amount of principal of an Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 502, or change the place of payment where, or the coin or currency in which, any Security or interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the date fixed for redemption thereof), or
     (2) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, the consent of whose Holders is required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any
 
waiver (of compliance with certain provisions of this Indenture or certain defaults hereunder and their consequences) provided for in this Indenture, or
     (3) modify any of the provisions of this Section or Section 513, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected thereby, or
     (4) modify the provisions in Article Thirteen of this Indenture with respect to the subordination of Outstanding Securities of any series in a manner adverse to the Holders thereof.
     A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture that has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.
     It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.
     Section 903
Execution of Supplemental Indentures.
     In executing or accepting the additional trusts created by any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture, and that all conditions precedent have been complied with. The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.
     Section 904
Effect of Supplemental Indentures.
     Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this Indenture shall be modified in accordance therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of Securities theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder shall be bound thereby.
     Section 905
Conformity with Trust Indenture Act.
     Every supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article shall conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect.
 
     Section 906
Reference in Securities to Supplemental Indentures.
     Securities authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the Company shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and executed by the Company and authenticated and delivered by the Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series.
     Section 1001
Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest.
     The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of such Securities and this Indenture.
     Section 1002
Maintenance of Office or Agency.
     The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series, an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for payment and an office or agency where Securities may be surrendered for transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities and this Indenture may be served. The Company initially appoints the Trustee, acting through its Corporate Trust Office, as its agent for said purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any change in the location of any such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain such office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.
     The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities may be presented or surrendered for any or all of such purposes, and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation and any change in the location of any such office or agency.
     Section 1003
Money for Security Payments to be Held in Trust.
     If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of (and premium, if
 
any) or interest on any of the Securities of such series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided, and will promptly notify the Trustee of its failure so to act.
     Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of or interest on any Securities, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such principal and premium (if any) or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its failure so to act.
     The Company will cause each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:
     (1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on Securities in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
     (2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any payment of principal (and premium, if any) or interest;
     (3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such Paying Agent; and
     (4) comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent.
     The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by the Company or any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
     Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Security and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal (and premium, if any) or interest has become due and payable shall (unless otherwise required by mandatory provision of applicable escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property law) be paid on Company Request to the Company, or (if then held by the Company) shall (unless otherwise required by mandatory provision of applicable escheat or abandoned or
 
unclaimed property law) be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid the Company.
     Section 1004
Statement as to Compliance.
     The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, on or before May 1 in each calendar year of the Company ending after the date hereof, a written statement (which need not comply with Section 102), signed by two of its officers (one of which shall be an officer specified in Section 314(a)(4) of the Trust Indenture Act), stating that in the course of the performance of their duties as officers of the Company they would normally have knowledge of any default by the Company in the performance or fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or condition contained in this Indenture, stating whether or not they have knowledge of any such default, and, if so, specifying each such default of which the signers have knowledge and the nature thereof.
     Section 1005
Waiver of Certain Covenants.
     The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any covenant or condition specified pursuant to Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series, if before or after the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such covenant or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such covenant or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company in respect of any such covenant or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
     Section 1101
Applicability of This Article.
     Redemption of Securities (whether by operation of a sinking fund or otherwise) as permitted or required by any form of Security issued pursuant to this Indenture shall be made in accordance with such form of Security specified pursuant to Section 301 and this Article; provided, however, that if any provision of any such form of Security shall conflict with any provision of this Article, the provision of such form of Security shall
 
govern. Except as otherwise set forth in the form of Security for such series, each Security for such series shall be subject to partial redemption in the amount of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof.
     Section 1102
Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.
     The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by or pursuant to a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of less than all of the Securities of any particular series and having the same terms, the Company shall, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such date and of the principal amount of Securities of that series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel evidencing compliance with such restriction.
     Section 1103
Selection of Securities to Be Redeemed.
     If less than all the Securities of a particular series and having the same terms are to be redeemed and such Securities are not Global Securities, the Trustee shall select, in the manner specified in such Securities or specified pursuant to Section 301, or, if no manner is specified in the Securities or pursuant to Section 301, as the Trustee shall select, not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, in such manner as in its sole discretion it shall deem appropriate and fair, the Securities or portions thereof of such series to be redeemed. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for partial redemption and the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed. If the Company shall so direct, Securities registered in the name of the Company, any Affiliate or any Subsidiary thereof shall not be included in the Securities selected for redemption.
     Section 1104
Notice of Redemption.
     Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than thirty, nor more than sixty days, prior to the date fixed for redemption, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Securities Register.
     With respect to Securities of each series to be redeemed, each notice of redemption shall state:
     (a) the date fixed for redemption for Securities of such series;
     (b) the redemption price at which Securities of such series are to be redeemed;
 
     (c) if less than all Outstanding Securities of such particular series and having the same terms are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the respective principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed;
     (d) that on the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price at which such Securities are to be redeemed will become due and payable upon each such Security or portion thereof, and that interest thereon, if any, shall cease to accrue on and after said date;
     (e) the place or places where such Securities are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price at which such Securities are to be redeemed; and
     (f) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case.
     Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company. The notice if mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. In any case, a failure to give such notice by mail or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security.
     Section 1105
Deposit of Redemption Price.
     Prior to the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in Section 1104, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities so called for redemption at the applicable redemption price.
     Section 1106
Payment of Securities Called for Redemption.
     If any notice of redemption has been given as provided in Section 1104, the Securities or portion of Securities with respect to which such notice has been given shall become due and payable on the date and at the place or places stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a place of payment in said notice specified, the said securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the applicable redemption price. Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of authorized denominations, in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented and having the same Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and terms. If a Global Security is so surrendered, such new Security will also be a new Global Security.
     Section 1107
Company's Right of Redemption.
     Unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture or Board Resolution adopted pursuant to Section 301 establishing the terms of the Securities of any
 
series and notwithstanding any additional redemption rights that may be so specified, the Company may, at its option and at any time, redeem the Securities of any series, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Securities being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, including any Additional Interest, to the date fixed for redemption.
     Section 1201
Applicability of Article.
     If this Article has been specified in accordance with Section 301 to be applicable to the Securities of any series, the provisions hereof shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of any series unless otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture or Board Resolution adopted pursuant to Section 301 establishing the terms of the Securities of any series.
     The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of any Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any sinking fund payment in excess of such minimum amount which is permitted to be made by the terms of such Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of any Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of such Securities.
     Section 1202
Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.
     In lieu of making all or any part of a mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any Securities of a series in cash, the Company may at its option, at any time no more than 16 months and no less than 30 days prior to the date on which such sinking fund payment is due, deliver to the Trustee Securities of such series (together with the unmatured coupons, if any, appertaining thereto) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company, except Securities of such series that have been redeemed through the application of mandatory or optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of the Securities of such series, accompanied by a Company Order instructing the Trustee to credit such obligations and stating that the Securities of such series were originally issued by the Company by way of bona fide sale or other negotiation for value; provided that the Securities to be so credited have not been previously so credited. The Securities to be so credited shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the redemption price for such Securities, as specified in the Securities so to be redeemed, for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
 
     Section 1203
Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
     Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for such Securities pursuant to the terms of such Securities, the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash in the currency in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as provided pursuant to Section 301) and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities pursuant to Section 1202. Such Certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its delivery the Company shall be obligated to make the cash payment or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the succeeding sinking fund payment date. In the case of the failure of the Company to deliver such Certificate (or, as required by this Indenture, the Securities and coupons, if any, specified in such Certificate), the sinking fund payment due on the succeeding sinking fund payment date for such series shall be paid entirely in cash and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amount of the Securities of such series subject to a mandatory sinking fund payment without the right to deliver or credit securities as provided in Section 1202 and without the right to make the optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series at such time.
     Any sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional) made in cash plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made with respect to the Securities of any particular series shall be applied by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent) on the sinking fund payment date on which such payment is made (or, if such payment is made before a sinking fund payment date, on the sinking fund payment date immediately following the date of such payment) to the redemption of Securities of such series at the redemption price specified in such Securities with respect to the sinking fund. Any sinking fund moneys not so applied or allocated by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in Section 1003) for such series and together with such payment (or such amount so segregated) shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1203. Any and all sinking fund moneys with respect to the Securities of any particular series held by the Trustee (or if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregated and held in trust as provided in Section 1003) on the last sinking fund payment date with respect to Securities of such series and not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series shall be applied by the Trustee (or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent), together with other moneys, if necessary, to be deposited (or segregated) sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of the Securities of such series at Maturity. The Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 1106. On or before each sinking fund payment date, the Company shall pay to the Trustee (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, the Company shall segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) in cash a sum in the currency in which Securities of
 
such series are payable (except as provided pursuant to Section 301) equal to the principal and any interest accrued to the redemption date for Securities or portions thereof to be redeemed on such sinking fund payment date pursuant to this Section 1203.
     Neither the Trustee nor the Company shall redeem any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of redemption of Securities of such series by operation of the sinking fund for such series during the continuance of a default in payment of interest, if any, on any Securities of such series or of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default occurring as a consequence of this paragraph) with respect to the securities of such series, except that if the notice of redemption shall have been provided in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Trustee (or the Company if the Company is then acting as its own Paying Agent) shall redeem such Securities if cash sufficient for that purpose shall be deposited with the Trustee (or segregated by the Company) for that purpose in accordance with the terms of this Article Twelve. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur and any moneys thereafter paid into such sinking fund shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be held as security for the payment of the Securities and coupons, if any, of such series; provided, however, that in case such default or Event of Default shall have been cured or waived herein, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next sinking fund payment date for the Securities of such series on which such moneys may be applied pursuant to the provisions of this Section 1203.
     Section 1301
Securities Subordinate to Senior Indebtedness.
     The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Security, by its acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this Article and any form of Security specified pursuant to Section 301, the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest (including any Additional Interest) on each and all of the Securities are hereby expressly made subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all amounts then due and payable in respect of all Senior Indebtedness, all as further provided in this Article and in such form of Security; provided, however, that if any provision of any such form of Security shall conflict with any provision of this Article, the provision of such form of Security shall govern.
     Section 1302
Payment Over of Proceeds Upon Dissolution, Etc.
     In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to the Company (each such event, if any, herein sometimes referred to as a "Proceeding"), then the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full of principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Senior
 
Indebtedness, or provision shall be made for such payment in cash or cash equivalents or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, before the Holders of the Securities are entitled to receive or retain any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (including any payment or distribution which may be payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other debt of the Company (including any series of the Securities) subordinated to the payment of the Securities, such payment or distribution being hereinafter referred to as a "Junior Subordinated Payment"), on account of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest) on the Securities or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities by the Company or any Subsidiary and to that end the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive, for application to the payment thereof, any payment or distribution of any kind of character, whether in cash, property or securities, including any Junior Subordinated Payment, which may be payable or deliverable in respect of the Securities in any such Proceeding.
     In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, the Trustee or the Holder of any Security shall have received any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, including any Junior Subordinated Payment, before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full or payment thereof is provided for in cash or cash equivalents or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment or distribution, have been made known to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment or distribution shall be paid over or delivered forthwith to the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee, agent or other Person making payment or distribution of assets of the Company for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness in full, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior Indebtedness.
     For purposes of this Article only, the words "any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other Person provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment which securities are subordinated in right of payment to all then outstanding Senior Indebtedness to substantially the same extent as the Securities are so subordinated as provided in this Article. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company into, another Person or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the sale of all or substantially all of its properties and assets as an entirety to another Person or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the sale of all or substantially all of its properties and assets as an entirety to another Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in Article Eight shall not be deemed a Proceeding for the purposes of this Section if the Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by sale such properties and assets as an entirety, as the case may be, shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, or sale comply with the conditions set forth in Article Eight.
 
     Section 1303
Prior Payment to Senior Indebtedness Upon Acceleration of Securities.
     In the event that any Securities are declared due and payable before their Stated Maturity, then and in such event the holders of the Senior Indebtedness outstanding at the time such Securities so become due and payable shall be entitled to receive payment in full of all amounts due on or in respect of such Senior Indebtedness (including any amounts due upon acceleration), or provision shall be made for such payment in cash or cash equivalents or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, before the Holders of the Securities are entitled to receive any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, properties or securities (including any Junior Subordinated Payment) by the Company on account of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest) on the Securities or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities by the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the satisfaction of any sinking fund payment in accordance with this Indenture or as otherwise provided in the applicable supplemental indenture or Board Resolution adopted pursuant to Section 301 establishing the terms of the Securities of any series by delivering and crediting pursuant to Section 1202 or as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of any series Securities which have been acquired (upon redemption or otherwise) prior to such declaration of acceleration.
     In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall make any payment to the Trustee or the Holder of any Security prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this Section, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment, have been made known to the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Company.
     The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any payment with respect to which Section 1302 would be applicable.
     Section 1304
No Payment When Senior Indebtedness in Default.
     (a) In the event and during the continuation of any default in the payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior Indebtedness, or in the event that any event of default with respect to any Senior Indebtedness shall have occurred and be continuing and shall have resulted in such Senior Indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would otherwise have become due and payable, unless and until such event of default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist and such acceleration shall have been rescinded or annulled, or
     (b) in the event any judicial proceeding shall be pending with respect to any such default in payment or such event or default, then no payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, properties or securities (including any Junior Subordinated Payment) shall be made by the Company on account of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest), if any, on the Securities or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities by the Company or any

          "Three-Month LIBOR" means, with respect to any Floating Rate Interest Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in U.S. dollars for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Floating Rate Interest Period that appears on Reuters Page LIBOR01 as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the LIBOR Determination Date for that Period. If such rate does not appear on Reuters Page LIBOR01, Three-Month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. dollars for a three-month period commencing on the first day of that Floating Rate Interest Period and in a principal amount of not less than $ 1,000,000 are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in the London interbank market selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company), at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on the LIBOR Determination Date for that Floating Rate Interest Period. The Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of these banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Floating Rate Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest whole multiple of 0.00001%) of such quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, Three-Month LIBOR with respect to that Floating Rate Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean (rounded upward if necessary to the nearest whole multiple of 0.00001%) of the rates quoted by three major banks in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company), at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the first day of that Floating Rate Interest Period for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a three-
 
month period commencing on the first day of that Floating Rate Interest Period and in a principal amount of not less than $ 1,000,000. However, if fewer than three banks selected by the Calculation Agent to provide quotations are quoting as described above, Three-Month LIBOR for that Floating Rate Interest Period will be the same as Three-Month LIBOR as determined for the previous Floating Rate Interest Period or, in the case of the Floating Rate Interest Period beginning on April 15, 2017, 6.375%. The establishment of Three-Month LIBOR for each Floating Rate Interest Period by the Calculation Agent shall (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding.
          "Trading Day" means a day on which Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or if not then listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a day on which Common Stock is traded or quoted on the principal U.S. securities exchange on which it is listed or quoted, or if not then listed or quoted on a U.S. securities exchange, a day on which Common Stock is quoted in the over-the-counter market.
          "Treasury Dealer" means Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (or its successor) or, if Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (or its successor) refuses to act as Treasury Dealer for the purpose of determining the Make-Whole Redemption Price or ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer, another nationally recognized investment banking firm that is a primary U.S. Government securities dealer specified by the Company for these purposes.
          "Treasury Price" means, with respect to a Redemption Date, the bid-side price for the Treasury Security as of the third Trading Day preceding the Redemption Date, as set forth in the daily statistical release (or any successor release) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on that Trading Day and designated "Composite 3:30 p.m. Quotations for U.S. Government Securities," as determined by the Treasury Dealer, except that: (i) if that release (or any successor release) is not published or does not contain that price information on that Trading Day, or (ii) if the Treasury Dealer determines that the price information is not reasonably reflective of the actual bid-side price of the Treasury Security prevailing at 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on that Trading Day, then Treasury Price will instead mean the bid-side price for the Treasury Security at or around 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on that Trading Day (expressed on a next Trading Day settlement basis) as determined by the Treasury Dealer through such alternative means as are commercially reasonable under the circumstances.
          "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to a Redemption Date, the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Treasury Security that corresponds to the Treasury Price (calculated by the Treasury Dealer in accordance with standard market practice and computed as of the second Trading Day preceding the Redemption Date).
          "Treasury Security" means the United States Treasury security that the Treasury Dealer determines would be appropriate to use, at the time of determination and in accordance with standard market practice, in pricing the Debentures being redeemed in a tender offer based on a spread to United States Treasury yields.
 
          Section 2.01. . (a) Designation. Pursuant to Sections 201 and 301 of the Indenture, there is hereby established a series of Securities of the Company designated as the 6.375% Directly-Issued Subordinated Capital Securities (DISCS) due 2067 (the "Debentures"), the principal amount of which to be issued shall be in accordance with Section 2.01(b) hereof and as set forth in any Company Order for the authentication and delivery of Debentures pursuant to the Indenture, and the form and terms of which shall be as set forth hereinafter.
Designation, Principal Amount and Authorized Denominations
SM
     (b) Principal Amount. Debentures in an initial aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000,000 shall, upon execution of this First Supplemental Indenture, be executed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee or an Authenticating Agent for authentication, and the Trustee or an Authenticating Agent shall thereupon authenticate and deliver said Debentures in accordance with a Company Order. Additional Debentures may be issued pursuant to this First Supplemental Indenture on the same terms and conditions as the Debentures issued under this First Supplemental Indenture in all respects, except for any difference in the issue date, issue price and interest accrued prior to the issue date of the additional Debentures, and with the same CUSIP number as the Debentures issued under this First Supplemental Indenture so long as such additional Debentures are fungible for U.S. tax purposes with the Debentures issued as of the date of this First Supplemental Indenture. Any additional Debentures issued under this First Supplemental Indenture will rank equally and ratably in right of payment with the Debentures issued on the date of this First Supplemental Indenture and together will be treated as a single series of Debentures for all purposes under the Indenture and this First Supplemental Indenture.

Repayment
     (a) Scheduled Maturity Date.
     (i) The principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, the Debentures shall be payable in full on April 15, 2037 or, if such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day (the "Scheduled Maturity Date"); provided, however, that in the event the Company has delivered an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee pursuant to clause (v) of this Section 2.02(a) in connection with the Scheduled Maturity Date, (x) the principal amount of Debentures payable on the Scheduled Maturity Date, if any, shall be the principal amount set forth in the notice of repayment, if any, accompanying such Officers' Certificate, (y) such principal amount of Debentures shall be repaid on the Scheduled Maturity Date pursuant to Article 5 hereof, and (z) subject to clause (ii) of this Section 2.02(a), the remaining Debentures shall remain Outstanding and
 
shall be payable on the immediately succeeding Quarterly Interest Payment Date or such earlier date on which they are redeemed pursuant to Article 4 hereof, become due and payable pursuant to Section 502 of the Indenture or on the Final Maturity Date.
     (ii) In the event the Company has delivered an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee pursuant to clause (v) of this Section 2.02(a) in connection with any Quarterly Interest Payment Date, the principal amount of the Debentures repayable on such Quarterly Interest Payment Date shall be the principal amount set forth in the notice of repayment, if any, accompanying such Officers' Certificate, and shall be repaid on such Quarterly Interest Payment Date pursuant to Article 5 hereof, and the remaining Debentures shall remain Outstanding and shall be payable on the immediately succeeding Quarterly Interest Payment Date or such earlier date on which they are redeemed pursuant to Article 4 hereof, become due and payable pursuant to Section 502 of the Indenture or on the Final Maturity Date.
     (iii) The obligation of the Company to repay the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) on any date prior to the Final Maturity Date shall be subject to its obligations under Article Thirteen of the Indenture to the holders of Senior Indebtedness.
     (iv) Until the Debentures are paid in full:
     (A) the Company shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, subject to a Market Disruption Event, to raise sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities during a 180-day period ending on the date on which the Company delivers the notice required by clause (v) of this Section 2.02(a) and Section 5.01 (not more than 15 and not less than 10 Business Days prior to the Scheduled Maturity Date) to permit repayment of the Debentures in full on the Scheduled Maturity Date pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.02(a); and
     (B) if the Company is unable for any reason to raise sufficient proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities to permit repayment in full of the Debentures on the Scheduled Maturity Date or any subsequent Quarterly Interest Payment Date, the Company shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, subject to a Market Disruption Event, to raise sufficient proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities during a 90-day period ending on the date on which the Company delivers the notice required by clause (v) of this Section 2.02(a) and Section 5.01 (not more than 15 and not less than 10 Business Days prior to the following Quarterly Interest Payment Date) to permit repayment of the Debentures in full on such following Quarterly Interest Payment Date pursuant to clause (i)(z) of this Section 2.02(a); and
 
     (C) the Company shall apply any net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities to the repayment of the Debentures as provided in clause (vi) of this Section 2.02(a).
     (v) The Company shall, if it has not raised sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of Qualifying Capital Securities pursuant to clause (iv) above in connection with any Repayment Date, deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee (which Officers' Certificate shall be forwarded by the Trustee to each Holder of Debentures) no more than 15 and no less than 10 Business Days in advance of such Repayment Date stating the amount of net proceeds, if any, raised pursuant to clause (iv) above in connection with such Repayment Date. The Company shall be excused from its obligation to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell Qualifying Capital Securities pursuant to clause (iv) above if such Officers' Certificate further certifies that: (A) a Market Disruption Event was existing during the 180-day period preceding the date of such Officers' Certificate or, in the case of any Repayment Date after the Scheduled Maturity Date, the 90-day period preceding the date of such Officers' Certificate; and (B) either (a) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire 180-day period or 90-day period, as the case may be, or (b) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of the period but the Company was unable after Commercially Reasonable Efforts to raise sufficient net proceeds during the rest of that period to permit repayment of the Debentures in full. Each Officers' Certificate delivered pursuant to this clause (v), unless no principal amount of Debentures is to be repaid on the applicable Repayment Date, shall be accompanied by a notice of repayment pursuant to Section 5.01 setting forth the principal amount of the Debentures to be repaid on such Repayment Date, if any, which amount shall be determined after giving effect to clause (vi) of this Section 2.02(a).
     (vi) Net proceeds of the issuance of any Qualifying Capital Securities that the Company is permitted to apply to repayment of the Debentures on any Repayment Date will be applied, first, to pay deferred interest (including Additional Interest) to the extent of Eligible Proceeds raised pursuant to Section 2.06, second, to pay current interest to the extent not paid from other sources and, third, to repay the Outstanding principal of the Debentures, subject to a minimum principal amount of $5 million to be repaid on any Repayment Date; provided that if the Company is obligated to sell Qualifying Capital Securities and apply the net proceeds to payments of principal of or interest on any outstanding securities, in addition to the Debentures then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Company from those sales and available for such payments shall be applied to the Debentures and those other outstanding securities having the same scheduled maturity date as the Debentures, pro rata in accordance with their respective Outstanding principal amounts and none of such net proceeds shall be applied to any other securities having a later scheduled maturity date until the principal of and all accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures has been paid in full. If the Company raises less than $5 million of net proceeds from the sale of Qualifying Capital Securities during the relevant 180-day or 90-day period, the Company will not be required to repay any
 
Debentures on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the next Quarterly Interest Payment Date, as applicable, but will use those net proceeds to repay the Debentures on the next Quarterly Interest Payment Date as of which the Company has raised at least $5 million of net proceeds.
     (vii) The Company shall not amend the Replacement Capital Covenant to impose additional restrictions on the type or amount of Qualifying Capital Securities that the Company may include for purposes of determining whether or to what extent repayment, redemption or purchase of the Debentures is permitted, except with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in aggregate Outstanding principal amount of the Debentures. Except as aforesaid, the Company may amend or supplement the Replacement Capital Covenant in accordance with its terms and without the consent of the Holders of the Debentures.
     (b) Final Maturity Date. The principal of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all Outstanding Debentures shall be due and payable on March 29, 2067 or, if such date is not a Business Day, the following Business Day (the "Final Maturity Date"), regardless of the amount of Qualifying Capital Securities the Company may have issued and sold by that time.
          Section 2.03. . The Debentures shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto and shall be issued in fully registered definitive form without interest coupons. Principal of and interest on the Debentures issued in definitive form will be payable, the transfer of such Debentures will be registrable and such Debentures will be exchangeable for Debentures bearing identical terms and provisions and notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Debentures and the Indenture may be served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company appoints the Trustee as its agent for the foregoing purposes, provided that payment of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the Holders at such address as shall appear in the Securities Register or by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the bank account number of the Holders specified in writing by the Holders not less than 10 days before the relevant Interest Payment Date and entered in the Securities Register by the Securities Registrar. The Debentures may be presented for registration of transfer or exchange at the Securities Registrar Office. The Debentures are initially solely issuable as Global Securities. Registered Debentures shall be physically transferred to all beneficial owners in definitive form in exchange for their beneficial interests in a Global Security if the Depositary with respect to such Global Securities notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Act of 1934, as the case may be, and a successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days of such notice.
Form
          In addition, beneficial interests in the Global Securities may be exchanged for definitive certificated Debentures upon request by or on behalf of the Depositary in accordance with customary procedures following the request of a beneficial owner seeking to exercise or enforce its rights under such Debentures. If the Company determines at any time that the Debentures shall no longer be represented by a Global Security, the Company shall inform the Depositary of such determination who will, in turn, notify participants of their right to withdraw their beneficial interest from the Global Security. If such participants then elect to withdraw their
 
beneficial interests, the Company shall issue certificates in definitive form in exchange for such beneficial interests in the Global Security. Any Global Security, or portion thereof, that is exchangeable pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be exchangeable for Debenture certificates, as the case may be, registered in the names directed by the Depositary.
          Section 2.04. .
Rate of Interest; Interest Payment Date
     (a) Rate of Interest. The Debentures shall bear interest from and including March 29, 2007 to but excluding April 15, 2017 or earlier redemption date of the Debentures, at the rate of 6.375% per annum, payable as set forth in clause (b) below computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. Commencing on April 15, 2017, the Debentures shall accrue interest at an annual rate of Three-Month LIBOR plus 2.25% (the "Floating Rate"), payable as set forth in clause (b) below. The amount of Floating Rate interest payable on the Debentures for any Floating Rate Interest Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the 360-day year. Amounts scheduled for payment but not paid upon any Interest Payment Date, including amounts not required to be paid due to deferral under the terms of this First Supplemental Indenture, shall bear Additional Interest from the originally scheduled payment date therefor at the rate borne by the Debentures, provided that if a scheduled Semi-Annual Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, such Semi-Annual Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, and no interest will accrue as a result of that postponement. If a scheduled Quarterly Interest Payment Date is not a Business Day, such Quarterly Interest Payment Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day; provided that if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Quarterly Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest will accrue from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or duly provided for to but excluding the Interest Payment Date on which the interest is actually paid, except as otherwise provided above with respect to extensions to the next Business Day.
     (b) Interest Payment Dates. Subject to the other provisions hereof, interest on the Debentures shall be payable (i) semi-annually in arrears on October 15 and April 15 of each year, commencing on October 15, 2007, until April 15, 2017 (each such date, a "Semi-Annual Interest Payment Date") and (ii) thereafter, quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on July 15, 2017 (each such date, a "Quarterly Interest Payment Date" and, together with Semi-Annual Interest Payment Dates, each, an "Interest Payment Date").
     (c) Interest will be payable to the Persons in whose name the Debentures are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date next preceding the relevant Interest Payment Date, except that interest payable at maturity shall be paid to the Person to whom principal is paid.
 
          Section 2.05. .
Interest Deferral
     (a) Option to Defer Interest Payments.
     (i) So long as no Event of Default with respect to the Debentures has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the right at one or more times, to defer the payment of interest on the Debentures for one or more consecutive Interest Periods that do not exceed 10 years, provided that no Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Final Maturity Date, the earlier accelerated maturity date of the Debentures or other repayment or redemption in full of the Debentures. If the Company has paid all deferred interest (including Additional Interest) on the Debentures, the Company shall have the right to elect to begin a new Deferral Period pursuant to this Section 2.05.
     (ii) At the end of any Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all deferred interest on the Debentures to the Persons in whose names the Debentures are registered in the Securities Register at the close of business on the Regular Record Date with respect to the Interest Payment Date at the end of such Deferral Period.
     (iii) The Company may elect to pay interest on any Interest Payment Date during any Deferral Period to the extent permitted by Section 2.05(b).
     (b) Payment of Deferred Interest. The Company will not pay any deferred interest (including Additional Interest) on the Debentures from any source other than Eligible Proceeds prior to the Final Maturity Date, except at any time that the principal amount has been accelerated and such acceleration has not been rescinded or in the case of a Business Combination to the extent described below in this Section 2.05(c). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may pay current interest from any available funds.
     (c) Business Combination Exception. If the Company is involved in a Business Combination where immediately after its consummation more than 50% of the voting stock of the Person formed by such Business Combination, or the Person that is the surviving or resulting entity of such Business Combination, or the Person to whom all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets are conveyed, transferred or leased in such Business Combination, is owned by the shareholders of the other party to such Business Combination or Person to whom all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets are conveyed, transferred or leased, or Continuing Directors cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the directors of the surviving or resulting entity or Person to whom all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets are conveyed, transferred or leased, then Section 2.05(b) and Section 2.06 shall not apply to any Deferral Period that is terminated on the next Interest Payment Date following the date of consummation of such Business Combination.
     (d) Notice of Deferral. The Company shall give written notice of its election to commence or continue any Deferral Period to the Trustee and the Holders of the
 
Debentures at least one Business Day and not more than sixty Business Days before the next Interest Payment Date. Notice of the Company's election of a Deferral Period shall be given to the Trustee and each Holder of Debentures at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register by first-class mail, postage prepaid.
          Section 2.06. .
Alternative Payment Mechanism
     (a) Obligation to Issue APM Qualifying Securities. During the APM Period, the Company shall, subject to the occurrence and continuation of a Market Disruption Event as described under Section 2.06(b) and subject to Section 2.05(b) and Section 2.06(c), use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to sell APM Qualifying Securities until the Company has raised an amount of Eligible Proceeds at least equal to the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid deferred interest on the Debentures, including Additional Interest, and apply such Eligible Proceeds on the next Interest Payment Date to the payment of deferred interest in accordance with this Section 2.06, provided that:
     (i) the Company shall not be required to pay interest on the Debentures (and therefore the Company shall not be required to issue APM Qualifying Securities to raise proceeds to pay such interest) at a time when the payment of such interest would violate the terms of any securities issued by the Company or any Subsidiary that is senior to the Debentures in right of payment upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company;
     (ii) the Company shall not be required to issue Common Stock prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of a Deferral Period to the extent that the number of shares of Common Stock issued during such Deferral Period together with the number of shares of Common Stock previously issued or issuable upon exercise of Qualifying Warrants previously issued during such Deferral Period applied to pay deferred interest on the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.06 would exceed an amount equal to 2% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the date of the Company's then most recent publicly available consolidated financial statements immediately prior to the date of such issuance (the "Common Equity Issuance Cap"); provided that the Common Equity Issuance Cap will cease to apply with respect to a Deferral Period following the fifth anniversary of the commencement of that Deferral Period, at which point the Company must pay any deferred interest, regardless of the time at which it was deferred, pursuant to this Section 2.06, subject to a Market Disruption Event and the Share Cap (defined below); and provided, further, that if the Common Equity Issuance Cap is reached during a Deferral Period and the Company subsequently pays all deferred interest, the Common Equity Issuance Cap will cease to apply with respect to a Deferral Period at the termination of such Deferral Period and will not apply again unless and until the Company starts a new Deferral Period;
     (iii) the Company shall not be required to issue Qualifying Preferred Stock and Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock to the extent that the net proceeds of any issuance of Qualifying Preferred Stock and Mandatorily
 
Convertible Preferred Stock, together with the net proceeds of all prior issuances of Qualifying Preferred Stock and any still-outstanding Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock applied to pay interest on the Debentures pursuant to this Section 2.06 during the current and all prior Deferral Periods, would exceed 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures (the "Preferred Stock Issuance Cap");
     (iv) the sale of Qualifying Warrants to pay deferred interest is an option that may be exercised at the Company's sole discretion, subject to the Share Cap, and the Company is not obligated to sell Qualifying Warrants or to apply the proceeds of any such sale to pay deferred interest on the Debentures, and no class of investors of the Company's securities, or any other party, may require the Company to issue Qualifying Warrants; and
     (v) notwithstanding the Common Equity Issuance Cap and the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap, for purposes of paying deferred interest, the Company shall not be permitted, subject to the provisions below, to sell Common Stock, Qualifying Warrants, or Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock such that the Common Stock to be issued (or which would be issuable upon exercise or conversion thereof) would be in excess of 169 million shares (as adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction) or as described in the following paragraph (the "Share Cap").
     The Share Cap limitation shall apply so long as the Debentures remain Outstanding. At any time that interest has been deferred under the Debentures and remains unpaid, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (1) raise the Share Cap such that it is at least equal to three times the number of shares of common stock that the Company would need to issue to raise sufficient proceeds to pay (assuming a price per share equal to the average trading price of shares of Common Stock over the ten-trading day period preceding such date) then outstanding deferred interest (including Additional Interest) on the Debentures up to a maximum of ten years of interest (including Additional Interest) or (2) if the Company cannot increase the Share Cap pursuant to the preceding clause (1), obtain shareholder consent at the next annual shareholders meeting to increase the number of shares of the Company's authorized common stock for purposes of satisfying the Company's obligations to pay deferred interest. For purposes of determining the amounts accruing during a floating rate period, the interest will be computed by reference to spot three-month LIBOR on the calculation date plus a margin equal to 2.25%.
     For the avoidance of doubt, once the Company reaches the Common Equity Issuance Cap for a Deferral Period, although the Company shall not be required to issue more Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.06(a) prior to the fifth anniversary of the commencement of a Deferral Period even if the amount referred to in clause (ii) of this Section 2.06(a) subsequently increases because of a subsequent increase in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Company shall have the right to do so.
 
     (b) Market Disruption Event. Section 2.06(a) shall not apply, with respect to any Interest Payment Date, if the Company shall have provided to the Trustee no more than 15 and no less than 10 Business Days prior to such Interest Payment Date an Officers' Certificate (which the Trustee will promptly forward upon receipt to each Holder of Debentures) stating that (i) a Market Disruption Event was existing after the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date and (ii) either (A) the Market Disruption Event continued for the entire period from the Business Day immediately following the preceding Interest Payment Date to the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which such Officers' Certificate is provided or (B) the Market Disruption Event continued for only part of this period, but the Company was unable after commercially reasonable efforts to raise sufficient Eligible Proceeds during the rest of that period to pay all accrued and unpaid deferred interest.
     (c) Partial Payment of Deferred Interest.
     (i) If the Company has raised some but not all Eligible Proceeds necessary to pay all deferred interest, including Additional Interest, on any Interest Payment Date, such Eligible Proceeds shall be allocated to pay accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable Interest Payment Date in chronological order based on the date each payment was first deferred, subject to the Common Equity Issuance Cap, the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap, and the Share Cap, as applicable, and payment on each installment of deferred interest shall be distributed to Holders of the Debentures on a pro rata basis.
     (ii) If the Company has outstanding Pari Passu Securities under which the Company is obligated to sell securities that are APM Qualifying Securities and apply the net proceeds to the payment of deferred interest or distributions, then on any date and for any period the amount of net proceeds received by the Company from those sales and available for payment of the deferred interest and distributions shall be applied to the Debentures and those other Pari Passu Securities on a pro rata basis up to the Common Equity Issuance Cap, the Preferred Stock Issuance Cap and the Share Cap (or comparable provisions in the instruments governing those other Pari Passu Securities) in proportion to the total amounts that are due on the Debentures and such other Pari Passu Securities.
     (d) Qualifying Warrants. If the Company sells Qualifying Warrants to pay deferred interest to satisfy its obligations pursuant to this Section 2.06, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to the Share Cap, to set the terms of such Qualifying Warrants so as to raise sufficient proceeds from their issuance to pay all deferred interest on the Debentures in accordance with this Section 2.06.
          Section 2.07. . (a) (i) Solely for purposes of the Debentures, Section 501 of the Indenture shall be deleted and replaced by the following:
Events of Default
 
Section 5.01.
Events of Default
"Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to the Debentures, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
 
When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in connection with an Event of Default specified in clauses (3) and (4) set forth in this Section 5.01, the expenses (including the reasonable charges and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy law.
     (ii) Solely for purposes of the Debentures, Section 502 of the Indenture shall be deleted and replaced by the following:
Section 5.02. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment. If an Event of Default set forth in Section 501 of the Indenture, as amended by Section 2.07 of this First Supplemental Indenture, with respect to the Debentures occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debentures may declare the principal amount of all of the Outstanding Debentures and interest accrued thereon, if any, to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders), and upon any such declaration such amount shall become immediately due and payable; provided that the payment of principal and interest, including Additional Interest, on the Debentures shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in Section 2.12 of this First Supplemental Indenture.
At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as provided in Article Five of the Indenture, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debentures, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
 
Upon receipt by the Trustee of written notice declaring such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, with respect to Debentures, all or part of which is represented by a Global Security, a record date shall be established for determining Holders of Outstanding Debentures entitled to join in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, that, unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day which is 90 days after such record date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice which has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of Section 502 of the Indenture, as amended by Section 2.07 of this First Supplement Indenture.
     (b) The Trustee shall provide to the Holders of the Debentures such notices as it shall from time to time provide with respect to the Debentures under Section 602 of the Indenture. In addition, the Trustee shall provide to the Holders of the Debentures notice of any Event of Default or event that, with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both,
 
would become an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures, within 90 days after the actual knowledge of a Responsible Officer of the Trustee of such Event of Default or other event unless the default or Event of Default has been cured or waived. However, except in cases of a default or an Event of Default in payment on the Debentures, the Trustee will be protected in withholding the notice if one of its Responsible Officers determines that withholding of the notice is in the interest of such Holders.
     (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture or this First Supplemental Indenture, the Trustee shall have no obligation to exercise any remedies with respect to any such default unless and except to the extent directed in writing to do so by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debentures in accordance with and subject to the conditions set forth in Sections 512 and 603(e) of the Indenture. The Trustee may conclusively assume that Sections 2.05 and 2.06 of this First Supplemental Indenture have been complied with unless the Company or the Holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures have given the Trustee written notice to the contrary.
     (d) For the avoidance of doubt, and without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available to the Trustee or the Holders of the Debentures under the Indenture, no breach by the Company of any covenant or obligation under the Indenture or the terms of the Debentures or the terms of this First Supplemental Indenture, including the Company's obligations under Section 2.02(a)(iv), Section 2.05 or Section 2.06 of this First Supplemental Indenture, shall be an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures, other than those specified in this Section 2.07; and except as provided herein and in the Indenture with respect the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, and as provided in Section 2.07(c) above, the Trustee shall be under no duty or obligation to exercise any remedies or otherwise take any action in respect of any other default that may occur under or in respect of this First Supplemental Indenture or the Indenture.
     (e) Solely for purposes of the Debentures, Section 513 of the Indenture shall be deleted and replaced with the following:
Section 513 Waiver of Past Defaults.
Prior to the declaration of the acceleration of the maturity of the Debentures, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Debentures may on behalf of the Holders of all the Debentures waive any past default with respect to the Debentures except a default:
 
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
          Section 2.08. .
Securities Registrar; Paying Agent; Delegation of Trustee Duties
     (a) The Company appoints The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as Securities Registrar and Paying Agent with respect to the Debentures.
     (b) Notwithstanding any provision contained herein, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Trustee may delegate its duty to provide such notices and to perform such other duties as may be required to be provided or performed by the Trustee under the Indenture, and, to the extent such obligation has been so delegated, the Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring the compliance of, nor be liable for the default or misconduct of, any such designee.
          Section 2.09. . Each Holder, by such Holder's acceptance of the Debentures, agrees that in certain events of the Company's bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership prior to the redemption or repayment of such Debentures, that Holder of Debentures shall have no claim for, and thus no right to receive, any deferred and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest) pursuant to Section 2.05 that has not been paid pursuant to Sections 2.05 and 2.06 to the extent the amount of such interest exceeds two years of accumulated and unpaid interest (including Additional Interest) on such Holder's Debentures.
Limitation on Claims in the Event of Bankruptcy, Insolvency or Receivership
          Section 2.10. . Solely for the purposes of the Debentures, the first paragraph of Section 307 of the Indenture shall be deleted and replaced by the following:

The office where the Debentures may be presented or surrendered for payment
 
and the office where the Debentures may be surrendered for transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Debentures and the Indenture may be served shall be the paying agent office.

So long as any Debentures remain Outstanding, if the Company has given notice of its election to defer interest payments on the Debentures but the related Deferral Period has not yet commenced or a Deferral Period is continuing, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary of the Company to:

     (a) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any shares of capital stock of the Company;

     (c) make any guarantee payments regarding any guarantee issued by the Company of securities of any Subsidiaries if the guarantee ranks upon the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding up on a parity with or junior to the Debentures;
provided, however, that the restrictions in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above do not apply to:
     (i) any purchase, redemption or other acquisition of shares of its capital stock by the Company in connection with (A) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more of its employees, officers, directors, consultants or independent contractors, (B) the satisfaction of the Company's obligations pursuant to any contract entered into in the ordinary course of business prior to the beginning of the applicable Deferral Period, (C) a dividend reinvestment or shareholder purchase plan, or (D) the issuance of the Company's capital stock, or securities convertible into or

     (vi) any payment of current or deferred interest on Pari Passu Securities that is made pro rata to the amounts due on such Pari Passu Securities (including the Debentures); provided that such payments are made in accordance with Section 2.06(c) to the extent it applies, and any payments of deferred interest on Pari Passu Securities that, if not made, would cause the Company to breach the terms of the instrument governing such Pari Passu Securities; or
     (vii) any payment of principal in respect of Pari Passu Securities having the same scheduled maturity date as the Debentures, as required under a provision of such other Pari Passu Securities that is substantially the same as the provisions in Section 2.02, and that is made on a pro rata basis among one or more series of Pari Passu Securities (including the Debentures) having such a provision and the Debentures; or

     (b) transfer or exchange any Debentures so selected for redemption, except, in the case of any Debentures being redeemed in part, any portion thereof not to be redeemed.
          Section 5.01. . The Company shall, not more than 45 nor less than 30 Business Days prior to each Repayment Date (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of the principal amount of Debentures to be repaid on such date pursuant to Section 2.02(a).
Repayments
          Section 5.02. . If less than all the Debentures are to be repaid on any Repayment Date (unless the Debentures are issued in the form of a Global Security), the particular Debentures to be repaid shall be selected not more than 30 days prior to such Repayment Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Debentures not previously repaid or called for redemption, by lot or such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Debentures, provided that the portion of the principal amount of any Debentures not repaid shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination).
Selection of the Debentures to be Repaid
          The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Debentures selected for partial repayment and the principal amount thereof to be repaid. For all purposes hereof, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the repayment of Debentures shall relate, in the case of any Debentures repaid or to be repaid only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Debentures which has been or is to be repaid.
          Section 5.03. . Notice of repayment shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not earlier than the 15th day, and not later than the 10th Business Day, prior to the Repayment Date, to each Holder of Debentures to be repaid, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security Register.
Notice of Repayment
          Each notice of repayment shall identify the Debentures to be repaid (including the Debentures' CUSIP number, if a CUSIP number has been assigned to the Debentures) and shall state:
     (a) the Repayment Date;
     (b) if less than all Outstanding Debentures are to be repaid, the identification (and, in the case of partial repayment, the respective principal amounts) of the particular Debentures to be repaid;

          Notice of repayment shall be given by the Company or, if the Company timely notifies the Trustee, at the Company's request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall be irrevocable. The notice if mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holders receive such notice. In any case, a failure to give such notice by mail or any defect in the notice to any Holder of any Debentures designated for repayment as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the repayment of any other Debentures.
          Section 5.04. . On or prior to 11:00 a.m. New York City time on the Repayment Date specified in the notice of repayment given as provided in Section 5.03, the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more Paying Agents (or if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, the Company will segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003 of the Indenture) an amount of money, in immediately available funds, sufficient to pay the principal amount of, and any accrued interest on, all the Debentures which are to be repaid on that date.

Upon presentation of any Debentures repaid in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery to the Holders thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Debenture, of authorized denominations, in aggregate principal amount equal to the portion of the Debentures not repaid and so presented and having the same Scheduled Maturity Date and other terms. If a Global Security is so surrendered, such new Debentures will also be a new Global Security.
Repayment of Debentures
          If any Debentures required to be repaid shall not be so repaid upon surrender thereof, the principal of such Debentures shall, until paid, bear interest from the applicable Repayment Date at the rate prescribed therefore in the Debentures.

EXHIBIT 4.3
     This Security is a Global Security within the meaning of the Indenture hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of The Depositary Trust Company (the "Depositary") or a nominee of the Depositary. This Security is exchangeable for Securities registered in the name of a person other than the Depositary or its nominee only in the limited circumstances described in the Indenture and may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary. Unless this Security is presented by an authorized representative of the Depository (55 Water Street, New York) to The Chubb Corporation or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any Security issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or such other name as requested by an authorized representative of the Depository and any payment hereon is made to Cede & Co., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY A PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
 
     THE CHUBB CORPORATION, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of New Jersey (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of five hundred million Dollars ($500,000,000) as may be revised from time to time on Schedule I hereto, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereof on April 15, 2037, or if such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day (the "Scheduled Maturity Date") or any subsequent Interest Payment Date (as hereinafter defined) to the extent set forth in the First Supplemental Indenture (as hereinafter defined). If that amount is not paid in full on the Scheduled Maturity Date or any subsequent Interest Payment Date, the remaining amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereof, will be due and payable on the Final Maturity Date. The Final Maturity Date will be March 29, 2067, or if such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed to those terms in the Indenture.
     The Company further promises to pay interest on said Outstanding principal sum from and including March 29, 2007, or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually (subject to deferral as set forth herein and in the First Supplemental Indenture) in arrears on October 15 and April 15 of each year, commencing on October 15, 2007, at the rate of 6.375% per annum (computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months) to but excluding April 15, 2017 or earlier redemption or repayment date of this Security, and thereafter to pay interest on said Outstanding principal sum quarterly in arrears on July 15, October 15, January 15, and April 15
 
of each year (each such date and, together with such October 15 and April 15 of each year, an "Interest Payment Date"), at a floating annual rate equal to Three-Month LIBOR plus 2.25% (computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed), until the principal hereof shall have become due and payable, plus Additional Interest, if any, until the principal hereof is paid or duly provided for or made available for payment. Accrued interest that is not paid on the applicable Interest Payment Date, including interest deferred pursuant to Section 2.05 of the First Supplemental Indenture, will bear Additional Interest, to the extent permitted by law, at the interest rate in effect for this Security from time to time, from the relevant Interest Payment Date, compounded on each subsequent Interest Payment Date. In the event that any Semi-Annual Interest Payment Date on which interest is payable on this Security is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and, in the case of payments on or prior to April 15, 2017, without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable. In the event that any Quarterly Interest Payment Date on which interest is payable on this Security is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date shall be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, provided that if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Quarterly Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest will accrue to but excluding the date that interest is actually paid. A "Business Day" shall mean any day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday, (ii) a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed or (iii) a day on which the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, is closed for business. The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date next preceding the relevant Interest Payment Date, which, with respect to a Semi-Annual Interest Payment Date, shall be October 1 or April 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding such Semi-Annual Interest Payment Date and, with respect to a Quarterly Interest Payment Date, the 15th day preceding such Quarterly Interest Payment Date. Any such interest installment not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
     So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the right at any time or from time to time during the term of this Security to defer payment of interest on this Security for one or more consecutive interest payment periods (each a "Deferral Period") that do not exceed 10 years, during which Deferral Periods the Company shall have the right, subject to Sections 2.05 and 2.06 of the First Supplemental Indenture, to make partial payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date, and at the end of which the Company shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid (together with Additional Interest thereon to the extent permitted by applicable law); provided, however, that no Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Final Maturity Date, or the earlier accelerated maturity date of this Security or other
 
repayment or redemption in full of this Security. Upon the termination of any Deferral Period and upon the payment of all deferred interest then due, the Company may elect to begin a new Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements. Deferred interest on the Security will bear interest at the then applicable interest rate, compounded on each Interest Payment Date, subject to applicable law. No interest shall be due and payable during a Deferral Period except at the end thereof. Additional limitations may apply, pursuant to Section 3.02 of the First Supplemental Indenture, if any Deferral Period lasts longer than one year.
     So long as any Securities remain Outstanding, if the Company has given notice of its election to defer interest payments on the Securities but the related Deferral Period has not yet commenced or a Deferral Period is continuing, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary of the Company to, (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any shares of the Company's capital stock, (ii) make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, purchase or redeem any debt securities of the Company that rank upon the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding-up on a parity with this Security (including this Security, the "Pari Passu Securities" ), or junior to this Security or (iii) make any guarantee payments regarding any guarantee issued by the Company of the securities of any Subsidiary if the guarantee ranks upon the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding-up on a parity with or junior to this Security (other than (a) any purchase, redemption or other acquisition of shares of the Company's capital stock by the Company in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more of its employees, officers, directors, consultants or independent contractors, (2) the satisfaction of the Company's obligations pursuant to any contract entered into in the ordinary course of business prior to the beginning of the applicable Deferral Period, (3) a dividend reinvestment or shareholder purchase plan, or (4) the issuance of the Company's capital stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for such capital stock, as consideration in an acquisition transaction entered into prior to the applicable Deferral Period, (b) any exchange, redemption or conversion of any class or series of the Company's capital stock, or the capital stock of one of its Subsidiaries, for any other class or series of its capital stock, or of any class or series of its indebtedness for any class or series of its capital stock, (c) any purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the securities being converted or exchanged, (d) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any shareholder rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any shareholder rights plan, or the redemption or purchase of rights pursuant thereto, (e) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equally with or junior to such stock, (f) any payment of current or deferred interest on Pari Passu Securities that is made pro rata to the amounts due on such Pari Passu Securities (including this Security); provided that such payments are made in accordance with Section 2.06(c) of the First Supplemental Indenture to the extent it applies, and any payments of deferred interest on Pari Passu Securities that, if not made, would cause the Company to breach the terms of the instrument governing such Pari Passu Securities; (g) any payment of principal in respect of Pari Passu Securities having the same scheduled maturity date as this Security, as required under a provision of such other Pari Passu Securities that is substantially the same as the provisions in Section 2.02 of the First Supplemental Indenture, and that is made on a pro rata basis among one or more series of Pari Passu Securities (including this
 
Security) having such a provision and this Security or (h) any repayment or redemption of a security necessary to avoid a breach of the instrument governing the same. In addition, if any Deferral Period lasts longer than one year, the restrictions on the Company's ability to redeem or purchase APM Qualifying Securities or any of its securities that on its bankruptcy or liquidation rank pari passu, or junior, as applicable, to such APM Qualifying Securities will continue until the first anniversary of the date on which all deferred interest on this Security has been paid, subject to the exceptions listed in clauses (a) through (h) above. However, if the Company is involved in a Business Combination where immediately after its consummation (i) more than 50% of the voting stock of the Person that is the surviving or resulting entity of such Business Combination or the Person to whom all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets are conveyed, transferred or leased in such Business Combination, is owned by the shareholders of the other party to such Business Combination or Person to whom all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets are conveyed, transferred or leased, or (ii) Continuing Directors cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the directors of the surviving or resulting entity or Person to whom all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets are conveyed, transferred or leased, then the immediately preceding sentence will not apply during the Deferral Period that is terminated on the next Interest Payment Date following the date of consummation of such Business Combination.
     The Company shall give written notice of its election to begin or extend any Deferral Period to the Trustee and the Holders of this Security at least one Business Day and not more than sixty Business Days before the next Interest Payment Date. Notice of the Company's election of a Deferral Period shall be given to the Trustee and each Holder of this Security at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register by first-class mail, postage prepaid.
     Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the United States, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Securities Register or (ii) by wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and to such bank account as may be designated by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Securities Register in writing not less than ten days before the relevant Interest Payment Date.
     The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Indebtedness, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such holder upon said provisions.
 
     The Company and, by acceptance of this Security or a beneficial interest in this Security, each Holder hereof and any person acquiring a beneficial interest herein, agree to treat this Security as indebtedness for United States federal income tax purposes.
     Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
     Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
In WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
     This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company, issued and to be issued in one or more series under the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of March 29, 2007 (herein called the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 29, 2007, between the Company and the Trustee (the "First Supplemental Indenture", and together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. By the terms of the Indenture, the Securities are issuable in series that may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest, rank and in any other respect provided in the Indenture.
     All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
     The Securities shall be redeemable at the option of the Company in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In particular, the Debentures are redeemable:
     (a) in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time after the date of the Indenture;
     (b) in whole but not in part, within 90 days after the occurrence of a Tax Event or a Rating Agency Event;
provided that no partial redemption shall be effected (x) unless at least $25 million aggregate principal amount of the Securities, excluding any Securities held by the Company or any of its affiliates, remains Outstanding after giving effect to such redemption and (y) if the principal amount has been accelerated and such acceleration has not been rescinded or unless all accrued and unpaid interest, including deferred interest, has been paid in full on all Outstanding Securities for all interest periods terminating on or before the redemption date.
     No sinking fund is provided for the Securities.
     The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction, discharge and defeasance of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee at any time to enter into a supplemental indenture or indentures for the purpose of modifying in any manner the rights and obligations of the Company and of the Holders of the Securities, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities to be affected by such supplemental indenture. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults
 
under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, if an Event of Default with respect to the Securities at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities may declare the entire principal amount and all accrued but unpaid interest of all the Outstanding Securities to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon such declaration, such amount shall become immediately due and payable; provided that the payment of principal and interest (including any Additional Interest) on such Securities shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in Article Eleven of the Indenture.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained under Section 1002 of the Indenture duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Securities Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned assigns and transfers this Security to:

SCHEDULE I
Principal amount of Securities outstanding represented by this certificate as of March 29, 2007: $500,000,000
Thereafter, the following decreases have been made:
 
     This Security is a Global Security within the meaning of the Indenture hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of The Depositary Trust Company (the "Depositary") or a nominee of the Depositary. This Security is exchangeable for Securities registered in the name of a person other than the Depositary or its nominee only in the limited circumstances described in the Indenture and may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary. Unless this Security is presented by an authorized representative of the Depository (55 Water Street, New York) to The Chubb Corporation or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any Security issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or such other name as requested by an authorized representative of the Depository and any payment hereon is made to Cede & Co., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY A PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
     THE CHUBB CORPORATION, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of New Jersey (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of five hundred million Dollars ($500,000,000) as may be revised from time to time on Schedule I hereto, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereof on April 15, 2037, or if such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day (the "Scheduled Maturity Date") or any subsequent Interest Payment Date (as hereinafter defined) to the extent set forth in the First Supplemental Indenture (as hereinafter defined). If that amount is not paid in full on the Scheduled Maturity Date or any subsequent Interest Payment Date, the remaining amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereof, will be due and payable on the Final Maturity Date. The Final Maturity Date will be March 29, 2067, or if such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed to those terms in the Indenture.
     The Company further promises to pay interest on said Outstanding principal sum from and including March 29, 2007, or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually (subject to deferral as set forth herein and in the First Supplemental Indenture) in arrears on October 15 and April 15 of each year, commencing on October 15, 2007, at the rate of 6.375% per annum (computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months) to but excluding April 15, 2017 or earlier redemption or repayment date of this Security, and thereafter to pay interest on said Outstanding principal sum quarterly in arrears on July 15, October 15, January 15, and April 15
 
of each year (each such date and, together with such October 15 and April 15 of each year, an "Interest Payment Date"), at a floating annual rate equal to Three-Month LIBOR plus 2.25% (computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed), until the principal hereof shall have become due and payable, plus Additional Interest, if any, until the principal hereof is paid or duly provided for or made available for payment. Accrued interest that is not paid on the applicable Interest Payment Date, including interest deferred pursuant to Section 2.05 of the First Supplemental Indenture, will bear Additional Interest, to the extent permitted by law, at the interest rate in effect for this Security from time to time, from the relevant Interest Payment Date, compounded on each subsequent Interest Payment Date. In the event that any Semi-Annual Interest Payment Date on which interest is payable on this Security is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and, in the case of payments on or prior to April 15, 2017, without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay) with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable. In the event that any Quarterly Interest Payment Date on which interest is payable on this Security is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date shall be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, provided that if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar month, such Quarterly Interest Payment Date shall be the immediately preceding Business Day. Interest will accrue to but excluding the date that interest is actually paid. A "Business Day" shall mean any day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday, (ii) a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed or (iii) a day on which the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, is closed for business. The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date next preceding the relevant Interest Payment Date, which, with respect to a Semi-Annual Interest Payment Date, shall be October 1 or April 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding such Semi-Annual Interest Payment Date and, with respect to a Quarterly Interest Payment Date, the 15th day preceding such Quarterly Interest Payment Date. Any such interest installment not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.
     So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the right at any time or from time to time during the term of this Security to defer payment of interest on this Security for one or more consecutive interest payment periods (each a "Deferral Period") that do not exceed 10 years, during which Deferral Periods the Company shall have the right, subject to Sections 2.05 and 2.06 of the First Supplemental Indenture, to make partial payments of interest on any Interest Payment Date, and at the end of which the Company shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid (together with Additional Interest thereon to the extent permitted by applicable law); provided, however, that no Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Final Maturity Date, or the earlier accelerated maturity date of this Security or other
 
repayment or redemption in full of this Security. Upon the termination of any Deferral Period and upon the payment of all deferred interest then due, the Company may elect to begin a new Deferral Period, subject to the above requirements. Deferred interest on the Security will bear interest at the then applicable interest rate, compounded on each Interest Payment Date, subject to applicable law. No interest shall be due and payable during a Deferral Period except at the end thereof. Additional limitations may apply, pursuant to Section 3.02 of the First Supplemental Indenture, if any Deferral Period lasts longer than one year.
     So long as any Securities remain Outstanding, if the Company has given notice of its election to defer interest payments on the Securities but the related Deferral Period has not yet commenced or a Deferral Period is continuing, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary of the Company to, (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any shares of the Company's capital stock, (ii) make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, purchase or redeem any debt securities of the Company that rank upon the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding-up on a parity with this Security (including this Security, the "Pari Passu Securities" ), or junior to this Security or (iii) make any guarantee payments regarding any guarantee issued by the Company of the securities of any Subsidiary if the guarantee ranks upon the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding-up on a parity with or junior to this Security (other than (a) any purchase, redemption or other acquisition of shares of the Company's capital stock by the Company in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more of its employees, officers, directors, consultants or independent contractors, (2) the satisfaction of the Company's obligations pursuant to any contract entered into in the ordinary course of business prior to the beginning of the applicable Deferral Period, (3) a dividend reinvestment or shareholder purchase plan, or (4) the issuance of the Company's capital stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable for such capital stock, as consideration in an acquisition transaction entered into prior to the applicable Deferral Period, (b) any exchange, redemption or conversion of any class or series of the Company's capital stock, or the capital stock of one of its Subsidiaries, for any other class or series of its capital stock, or of any class or series of its indebtedness for any class or series of its capital stock, (c) any purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of such capital stock or the securities being converted or exchanged, (d) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any shareholder rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any shareholder rights plan, or the redemption or purchase of rights pursuant thereto, (e) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equally with or junior to such stock, (f) any payment of current or deferred interest on Pari Passu Securities that is made pro rata to the amounts due on such Pari Passu Securities (including this Security); provided that such payments are made in accordance with Section 2.06(c) of the First Supplemental Indenture to the extent it applies, and any payments of deferred interest on Pari Passu Securities that, if not made, would cause the Company to breach the terms of the instrument governing such Pari Passu Securities; (g) any payment of principal in respect of Pari Passu Securities having the same scheduled maturity date as this Security, as required under a provision of such other Pari Passu Securities that is substantially the same as the provisions in Section 2.02 of the First Supplemental Indenture, and that is made on a pro rata basis among one or more series of Pari Passu Securities (including this
 
Security) having such a provision and this Security or (h) any repayment or redemption of a security necessary to avoid a breach of the instrument governing the same. In addition, if any Deferral Period lasts longer than one year, the restrictions on the Company's ability to redeem or purchase APM Qualifying Securities or any of its securities that on its bankruptcy or liquidation rank pari passu, or junior, as applicable, to such APM Qualifying Securities will continue until the first anniversary of the date on which all deferred interest on this Security has been paid, subject to the exceptions listed in clauses (a) through (h) above. However, if the Company is involved in a Business Combination where immediately after its consummation (i) more than 50% of the voting stock of the Person that is the surviving or resulting entity of such Business Combination or the Person to whom all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets are conveyed, transferred or leased in such Business Combination, is owned by the shareholders of the other party to such Business Combination or Person to whom all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets are conveyed, transferred or leased, or (ii) Continuing Directors cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the directors of the surviving or resulting entity or Person to whom all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets are conveyed, transferred or leased, then the immediately preceding sentence will not apply during the Deferral Period that is terminated on the next Interest Payment Date following the date of consummation of such Business Combination.
     The Company shall give written notice of its election to begin or extend any Deferral Period to the Trustee and the Holders of this Security at least one Business Day and not more than sixty Business Days before the next Interest Payment Date. Notice of the Company's election of a Deferral Period shall be given to the Trustee and each Holder of this Security at such Holder's address appearing in the Security Register by first-class mail, postage prepaid.
     Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the United States, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Securities Register or (ii) by wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and to such bank account as may be designated by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the Securities Register in writing not less than ten days before the relevant Interest Payment Date.
     The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and this Security is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, waives all notice of the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of Senior Indebtedness, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such holder upon said provisions.
 
     The Company and, by acceptance of this Security or a beneficial interest in this Security, each Holder hereof and any person acquiring a beneficial interest herein, agree to treat this Security as indebtedness for United States federal income tax purposes.
     Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
     Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
In WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
     This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company, issued and to be issued in one or more series under the Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated as of March 29, 2007 (herein called the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 29, 2007, between the Company and the Trustee (the "First Supplemental Indenture", and together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. By the terms of the Indenture, the Securities are issuable in series that may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest, rank and in any other respect provided in the Indenture.
     All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
     The Securities shall be redeemable at the option of the Company in accordance with the terms of the Indenture. In particular, the Debentures are redeemable:
     (a) in whole or in part, at the Company's option at any time after the date of the Indenture;
     (b) in whole but not in part, within 90 days after the occurrence of a Tax Event or a Rating Agency Event;
provided that no partial redemption shall be effected (x) unless at least $25 million aggregate principal amount of the Securities, excluding any Securities held by the Company or any of its affiliates, remains Outstanding after giving effect to such redemption and (y) if the principal amount has been accelerated and such acceleration has not been rescinded or unless all accrued and unpaid interest, including deferred interest, has been paid in full on all Outstanding Securities for all interest periods terminating on or before the redemption date.
     No sinking fund is provided for the Securities.
     The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction, discharge and defeasance of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the Company and the Trustee at any time to enter into a supplemental indenture or indentures for the purpose of modifying in any manner the rights and obligations of the Company and of the Holders of the Securities, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities to be affected by such supplemental indenture. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults
 
under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, if an Event of Default with respect to the Securities at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities may declare the entire principal amount and all accrued but unpaid interest of all the Outstanding Securities to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon such declaration, such amount shall become immediately due and payable; provided that the payment of principal and interest (including any Additional Interest) on such Securities shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in Article Eleven of the Indenture.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Securities Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company maintained under Section 1002 of the Indenture duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Securities Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

In particular, no holder of the Debentures is a third party beneficiary of this Replacement Capital Covenant, it being understood that such holders may have rights under the Subordinated Indenture.
