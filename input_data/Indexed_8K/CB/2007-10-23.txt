FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     WARREN, New Jersey, October 23, 2007  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] today reported that net income in the third quarter of 2007 was $738 million or $1.87 per share, compared to $604 million or $1.43 per share in the third quarter of 2006.
     Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, increased to $662 million from $579 million in the third quarter of 2006. Operating income per share increased 23% to a record $1.68 from $1.37.
     Total net written premiums for the third quarter declined 2% to $2.9 billion. Net written premiums for the insurance business were flat  down 3% in the U.S. and up 12% outside the U.S. (4% in local currencies). Net written premiums for the reinsurance assumed business declined 65%, reflecting the impact of the Chubb Re-Harbor Point transaction completed in December 2005.
     The third quarter combined loss and expense ratio was 81.6% in 2007, compared to 85.5% in 2006. Catastrophe losses accounted for 2.0 percentage points of the combined ratio in the third quarter of 2007 compared to 1.5 points in the third quarter of 2006. The expense ratio for the third quarter was 29.8% in 2007 and 28.6% in 2006.
     Property and casualty investment income after taxes for the third quarter increased 10% to $324 million in 2007 from $295 million in 2006.
     During the third quarter, Chubb repurchased 10,193,239 shares of its common stock at a total cost of $519 million. As of September 30, 2007, there were 7,926,122 shares of common stock available for repurchase under the current authorization.
 
Nine-Month Results
     For the first nine months of 2007, net income was $2.2 billion or $5.33 per share, compared with $1.9 billion or $4.43 per share for the first nine months of 2006. Operating income for the first nine months of 2007 totaled a record $1.9 billion or $4.81 per share, compared with $1.8 billion or $4.14 per share for the first nine months of 2006.
     Total net written premiums for the first nine months declined 2% to $8.9 billion. Net written premiums for the insurance business increased 1%  down 1% in the U.S. and up 8% outside the U.S. (2% in local currencies). Net written premiums for the reinsurance assumed business declined 70%.
     The combined loss and expense ratio for the first nine months was 82.6% in 2007, compared to 84.5% in 2006. The impact of catastrophes accounted for 2.8 percentage points of the combined ratio in the first nine months of 2007 compared to 1.4 points in the first nine months of 2006. The expense ratio for the first nine months was 29.9% in 2007 and 28.7% in 2006.
     Property and casualty investment income after taxes for the first nine months increased 9% to $942 million in 2007 from $862 million in 2006.
     During the first nine months, Chubb repurchased 31,919,816 shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1.7 billion.
Revised Guidance
     "Chubb's record third quarter operating income reflects our continued emphasis on underwriting excellence, which resulted in a record-low combined ratio with outstanding profit contributions from each of our three business units," said John D. Finnegan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
     "Based on our outstanding results for the first nine months and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are increasing our 2007 calendar year operating income per share guidance to a range of $6.05 to $6.15 from the $5.70 to $6.10 range we provided in July," said Mr. Finnegan.
     "This revised guidance continues to assume 4 percentage points of catastrophe losses for the year," said Mr. Finnegan. "Since the impact of catastrophe losses in the first nine months was only 2.8 points, this implies 7.7 points of catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter, which is substantially higher than our historic fourth-quarter average. However, given the uncertain impact of the California wildfires, we decided to be conservative and maintain our catastrophe assumption for the year," he said.
 
     "The strength of our operating performance is evidenced by the fact that despite the high level of assumed catastrophe losses, we are still projecting fourth-quarter operating income per share in the range of $1.24 to $1.34," said Mr. Finnegan. The impact on operating income per share of each point of catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter is about five cents. Guidance and related assumptions are subject to the risks outlined in the company's forward-looking information safe-harbor statement below.

Definitions of Key Terms
Operating Income
Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is measured based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax-exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
Book value per common share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income, the after-tax appreciation or depreciation on the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at market value. The appreciation or depreciation on available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio
The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
