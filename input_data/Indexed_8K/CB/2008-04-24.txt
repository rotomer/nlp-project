Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     WARREN, New Jersey, April 24, 2008  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] today reported that net income in the first quarter of 2008 was $664 million or $1.77 per share, compared to $710 million or $1.71 per share in the first quarter of 2007.
     Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, declined 2% to $620 million from $634 million in the first quarter of 2007. Average diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter decreased to 375.8 million in 2008 from 414.3 million in 2007. As a result, operating income per share increased 8% to $1.65 in the first quarter of 2008 from $1.53 in the first quarter of 2007.
     Net written premiums for the first quarter increased 2% to $2.9 billion. Premiums for the insurance business increased 3% due to the impact of currency fluctuation on business written outside the United States; premiums were flat in the U.S. and increased 14% outside the U.S. (4% in local currencies). Premiums for the reinsurance assumed business continued to decline, reflecting the impact of the Chubb Re-Harbor Point transaction completed in December 2005.
     The first quarter combined loss and expense ratio was 83.9% in 2008, compared to 83.4% in 2007. The impact of catastrophes accounted for 1.8 percentage points of the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2008, compared to 2.5 percentage points in the first quarter of 2007. Excluding catastrophes, the first quarter combined ratio was 82.1% in 2008 and 80.9% in 2007. The expense ratio for the first quarter was 30.5% in 2008 and 30.4% in 2007.

Definitions of Key Terms
Operating Income
Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is measured based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
Book value per common share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income, the after-tax appreciation or depreciation on the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at fair value. The appreciation or depreciation on available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio
The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
