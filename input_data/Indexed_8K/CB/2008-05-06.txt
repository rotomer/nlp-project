     (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related Preliminary Prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or the Time of Sale Information, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth (i) in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and (ii) under the heading "Underwriting", (A) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (B) the sentences related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Final Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; and that the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action and/or to assume the defense thereof, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel) (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with local counsel)), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to
provided
however

represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 8 or Section 9 (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     
Section 9. Contribution.
     (a) If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8 (a) or Section 8 (b), then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in Section 8 (a) and Section 8 (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportions as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offer and sale of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same proportions as the aggregate principal amount of the Securities less the fee paid to the Underwriters on the one hand and the fee paid to the Underwriters on the other hand bear to the aggregate principal amount of the Securities. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (a) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (a). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (a) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (a), the Underwriters shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the fee received by it pursuant to Schedule I exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriters have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person
 
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     (b) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of any Underwriter and to each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of such Underwriter under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which such Underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     (c) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in Section 8 and this Section 9 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter, or the Company, its officers or director or any controlling person of the Company, and the completion of the offer, sale and delivery of the Securities.
     
Section 10. Default by an Underwriter.
     (a) If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of the 2018 Senior Notes or the 2038 Senior Notes, as applicable, set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Senior Notes or the 2038 Senior Notes, as applicable, set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Senior Notes or the 2038 Senior Notes, as applicable, which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Senior Notes or the 2038 Senior Notes, as applicable, set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but (unless a substitute purchaser is obtained pursuant to clause (b) below) shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the 2018 Senior Notes or the 2038 Senior Notes, as applicable, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the 2018 Senior Notes or the 2038 Senior Notes, as applicable, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company.
     (b) In the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto and the nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities that the defaulting Underwriter failed to purchase, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for another party or other parties to purchase such otherwise unpurchased Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties to whom the Representatives do not reasonably object to purchase such Securities on such terms. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement.
 
     (c) In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 10, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representative shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
     
Section 11. Termination.
     This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such delivery and payment (i) trading in the Company's common stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering and sale or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any amendment or supplement thereto).
     
Section 12. Notices.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and:

Exhibit 4.1
          This Security is a Global Security within the meaning of the Indenture (as defined on the Reverse of this Security) hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company (the "Depository") or a nominee of the Depository. This Security is exchangeable for Securities registered in the name of a person other than the Depository or its nominee only in the limited circumstances described in the Indenture and may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository. Unless this Security is presented by an authorized representative of the Depository (55 Water Street, New York) to The Chubb Corporation or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any Security issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or such other name as requested by an authorized representative of the Depository and any payment hereon is made to Cede & Co., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY A PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
          THE CHUBB CORPORATION, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of New Jersey (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) as may be revised from time to time on Schedule I hereto, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereof on May 15, 2018, or if such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day, and to pay interest thereon from and including May 6, 2008, or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears on November 15 and May 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2008, at the rate of 5.75% per annum to and including May 15, 2018 or earlier redemption date of this Security (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date").
          The amount of interest payable for any full semi-annual period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full semi-annual period for which interest is computed will be computed on the basis of a 30-day month and, for any period less than a month, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month. In the event that any Interest Payment Date or the maturity date is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest or principal payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day with the same force
 
and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable and without any interest or other payment in respect of the delay.
          The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security is registered on the first Business Day of the month in which the Interest Payment Date falls or on any other day more than one and less than sixty Business Days prior to such Interest Payment Date that the Company chooses (such day, an "Alternate Record Date"); provided that the Company shall provide written notice of such Alternate Record Date to the Trustee not less than ten Business Days prior to the Alternate Record Date.
          A "Business Day" shall mean any day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday, (ii) a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed or (iii) a day on which the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee is closed for business.
          Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the United States, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the securities register or (ii) by wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and to such bank account as may be designated by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the securities register in writing not less than ten days before the relevant Interest Payment Date.
          The Company and, by acceptance of this Security or a beneficial interest in this Security, each Holder hereof and any person acquiring a beneficial interest herein, agree to treat this Security as indebtedness for United States federal income tax purposes.
          Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
          Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
In WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
          This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company, issued and to be issued in one or more series under the indenture, dated as of October 25, 1989 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to JPMorgan Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Bank One Trust Company, N.A. (formerly the First National Bank of Chicago)), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented through the date hereof (the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. By the terms of the Indenture, the Securities are issuable in series that may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest, rank and in any other respect provided in the Indenture.
          All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
          The Securities will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Company's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:
          in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.
          For the purposes of the preceding paragraph:
 
          Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of the Securities to be redeemed at its registered address. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption.
          The Company will not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of the Securities selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of such Securities being redeemed in part.
          No sinking fund is provided for the Securities. The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction, discharge and defeasance of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture, which conditions apply to this Security.
          In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to the Securities, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
          The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding (as defined in the Indenture) of all series to be affected (voting as one class), evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each such series; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the final maturity of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or any premium thereon, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on redemption thereof, or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue
 
Discount Security that would be due and payable upon an acceleration of the maturity thereof or provable in bankruptcy, or change the currency of payments of principal, premium, if any, or interest, or extend the time or reduce the amount of any payment to any sinking fund or analogous obligation relating to any Security, or impair or affect the rights of any Holder to institute suit for the payment thereof, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected or (iii) reduce the percentage of Securities of this series outstanding necessary to consent to waive any past default under the Indenture to less than a majority, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (iv) modify the provisions of the sections of the Indenture dealing with supplementary indentures or waivers of covenants, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected thereby, provided, however, that this clause shall not be deemed to require the consent of any Holder with respect to changes in the references to "the Trustee" and concomitant changes in such sections of the Indenture or the deletion of this proviso, in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture. It is also provided in the Indenture that, with respect to certain defaults or Events of Default regarding the Securities of any series, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of such Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount Outstanding of the Securities of such series (or, in the case of certain defaults or Events of Default, all or certain series of the Securities) may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series (or all or certain series of the Securities, as the case may be) waive any such past default or Event of Default and its consequences. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and any Security which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Security or such other Securities.

          The Company, the Trustee and any authorized agent of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Security (whether or not this Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and premium, if any, and subject to the provisions on the face hereof, interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any authorized agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
 
          No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Security, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof.

          The amount of interest payable for any full semi-annual period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full semi-annual period for which interest is computed will be computed on the basis of a 30-day month and, for any period less than a month, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month.

The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and any Security which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Security or such other Securities.

Principal amount of Securities outstanding represented by this certificate as of May 6, 2008: $500,000,000
Thereafter, the following decreases have been made:
 
          This Security is a Global Security within the meaning of the Indenture (as defined on the Reverse of this Security) hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company (the "Depository") or a nominee of the Depository. This Security is exchangeable for Securities registered in the name of a person other than the Depository or its nominee only in the limited circumstances described in the Indenture and may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the Depository. Unless this Security is presented by an authorized representative of the Depository (55 Water Street, New York) to The Chubb Corporation or its agent for registration of transfer, exchange or payment, and any Security issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or such other name as requested by an authorized representative of the Depository and any payment hereon is made to Cede & Co., ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY A PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.
          THE CHUBB CORPORATION, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of New Jersey (hereinafter called the "Company", which term includes any successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) as may be revised from time to time on Schedule I hereto, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereof on May 15, 2038, or if such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day, and to pay interest thereon from and including May 6, 2008, or from and including the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears on November 15 and May 15 of each year, commencing on November 15, 2008, at the rate of 6.50% per annum to and including May 15, 2038 or earlier redemption date of this Security (each such date, an "Interest Payment Date").
          The amount of interest payable for any full semi-annual period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable for any period shorter than a full semi-annual period for which interest is computed will be computed on the basis of a 30-day month and, for any period less than a month, on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month. In the event that any Interest Payment Date or the maturity date is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest or principal payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day with the same force
 
and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable and without any interest or other payment in respect of the delay.
          The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Security is registered on the first Business Day of the month in which the Interest Payment Date falls or on any other day more than one and less than sixty Business Days prior to such Interest Payment Date that the Company chooses (such day, an "Alternate Record Date"); provided that the Company shall provide written notice of such Alternate Record Date to the Trustee not less than ten Business Days prior to the Alternate Record Date.
          A "Business Day" shall mean any day other than (i) a Saturday or Sunday, (ii) a day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed or (iii) a day on which the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee is closed for business.
          Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the United States, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the securities register or (ii) by wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place and to such bank account as may be designated by the Person entitled thereto as specified in the securities register in writing not less than ten days before the relevant Interest Payment Date.
          The Company and, by acceptance of this Security or a beneficial interest in this Security, each Holder hereof and any person acquiring a beneficial interest herein, agree to treat this Security as indebtedness for United States federal income tax purposes.
          Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.
          Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
 
In WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this instrument to be duly executed.
 
          This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company, issued and to be issued in one or more series under the indenture, dated as of October 25, 1989 between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to JPMorgan Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Bank One Trust Company, N.A. (formerly the First National Bank of Chicago)), as trustee (the "Trustee"), as amended and supplemented through the date hereof (the "Indenture"), to which Indenture and all other indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. By the terms of the Indenture, the Securities are issuable in series that may vary as to amount, date of maturity, rate of interest, rank and in any other respect provided in the Indenture.
          All terms used in this Security that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
          The Securities will be redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the Company's option, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:
 
          Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of the Securities to be redeemed at its registered address. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption.
          The Company will not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of the Securities selected for redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of such Securities being redeemed in part.
          No sinking fund is provided for the Securities. The Indenture contains provisions for satisfaction, discharge and defeasance of the entire indebtedness of this Security upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture, which conditions apply to this Security.
          In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to the Securities, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
          The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding (as defined in the Indenture) of all series to be affected (voting as one class), evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each such series; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the final maturity of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or any premium thereon, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of any interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on redemption thereof, or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue
 
Discount Security that would be due and payable upon an acceleration of the maturity thereof or provable in bankruptcy, or change the currency of payments of principal, premium, if any, or interest, or extend the time or reduce the amount of any payment to any sinking fund or analogous obligation relating to any Security, or impair or affect the rights of any Holder to institute suit for the payment thereof, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected or (iii) reduce the percentage of Securities of this series outstanding necessary to consent to waive any past default under the Indenture to less than a majority, without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (iv) modify the provisions of the sections of the Indenture dealing with supplementary indentures or waivers of covenants, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected thereby, provided, however, that this clause shall not be deemed to require the consent of any Holder with respect to changes in the references to "the Trustee" and concomitant changes in such sections of the Indenture or the deletion of this proviso, in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture. It is also provided in the Indenture that, with respect to certain defaults or Events of Default regarding the Securities of any series, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of such Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount Outstanding of the Securities of such series (or, in the case of certain defaults or Events of Default, all or certain series of the Securities) may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series (or all or certain series of the Securities, as the case may be) waive any such past default or Event of Default and its consequences. The preceding sentence shall not, however, apply to a default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of this Security and any Security which may be issued in exchange or substitution herefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Security or such other Securities.
          No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
          Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
          The Company, the Trustee and any authorized agent of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Security (whether or not this Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and premium, if any, and subject to the provisions on the face hereof, interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any authorized agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
 
          No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Security, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof.
          The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.
          THE INDENTURE AND THIS SECURITY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
          This is one of the Securities referred to in the within mentioned Indenture.
 
FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned assigns and transfers this Security to:
