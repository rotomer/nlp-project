Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     WARREN, New Jersey, July 24, 2008  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] today reported that net income in the second quarter of 2008 was $469 million or $1.27 per share, compared to $709 million or $1.75 per share in the second quarter of 2007.
     Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, declined to $518 million from $648 million in the second quarter of 2007. Operating income per share declined 13% to $1.40 from $1.60.
     Total net written premiums for the second quarter were flat at $3.0 billion. Premiums were down 3% in the U.S. and up 11% outside the U.S. (3% in local currencies).
     The second quarter combined loss and expense ratio was 88.5% in 2008, compared to 82.7% in 2007. Catastrophe losses for the second quarter of 2008 accounted for 5.4 percentage points of the combined ratio. In the second quarter of 2007, catastrophe losses accounted for 3.9 points of the combined ratio. The expense ratio for the second quarter was 29.8% in 2008 and 29.6% in 2007.
     Property and casualty investment income after taxes for the second quarter increased 4% to $327 million in 2008 from $313 million in 2007.
     During the second quarter, Chubb repurchased 5,477,480 shares of its common stock at a total cost of $281 million. As of June 30, 2008, there were 9,315,206 shares of common stock remaining under the current repurchase authorization.
 
     "In an otherwise excellent quarter, our results were adversely impacted by unusually high catastrophe losses and by one large Surety loss," said John D. Finnegan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. The catastrophe losses were primarily related to storms in the Midwest United States that mostly affected Chubb's commercial Property & Marine insurance line.
Six-Month Results
     For the first six months of 2008, net income was $1.1 billion or $3.04 per share, compared with $1.4 billion or $3.46 per share for the first half of 2007. Operating income for the first half of 2008 totaled $1.1 billion or $3.05 per share, compared with $1.3 billion or $3.13 per share for the first half of 2007.
     Total net written premiums for the first six months increased 1% to $6.0 billion. Premiums declined 2% in the U.S. and increased 13% outside the U.S. (4% in local currencies).
     The combined loss and expense ratio for the first six months was 86.2% in 2008, compared to 83.1% in 2007. Catastrophe losses in the first half of 2008 accounted for 3.6 percentage points of the combined ratio. In the first half of 2007, catastrophe losses accounted for 3.2 points of the combined ratio. The expense ratio for the first six months was 30.1% in 2008 and 30.0% in 2007.
     Property and casualty investment income after taxes for the first six months increased 6% to $654 million in 2008 from $618 million in 2007.
     During the first six months, Chubb repurchased 16,797,464 shares of its common stock at a total cost of $863 million.
Outlook for 2008
     "Since our catastrophe losses in the first six months were higher than expected and we're now in the midst of the hurricane season," said Mr. Finnegan, "we have increased our catastrophe loss assumption for the full year from 3 points to 4 points. Nevertheless, in light of the strong underlying performance of our businesses in the first half and the outlook for the second half, we are affirming the guidance we provided last January for full-year 2008 operating income per share of $5.70 to $6.10." The impact of each point of catastrophe losses on operating income per share for the year is approximately $0.20.
 
     The updated operating income guidance also assumes:

Definitions of Key Terms
Operating Income
Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is measured based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
Book value per common share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income, the after-tax appreciation or depreciation on the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at fair value. The appreciation or depreciation on available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio
The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
