FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     WARREN, New Jersey, October 23, 2008  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] today reported that net income in the third quarter of 2008 was $264 million or $0.73 per share, compared to $738 million or $1.87 per share in the third quarter of 2007. Net income for the third quarter of 2008 reflects net realized investment losses, including impairments, of $113 million before tax ($0.20 per share after-tax). Net income for the third quarter of 2007 includes net realized investment gains of $117 million before tax ($0.19 per share after-tax).
     Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, declined to $338 million from $662 million in the third quarter of 2007. Operating income per share declined 45% to $0.93 from $1.68.
     Total net written premiums for the third quarter decreased 1% to $2.9 billion. Premiums were down 4% in the U.S. and up 8% outside the U.S. (4% in local currencies).
     The third quarter combined loss and expense ratio was 98.1% in 2008, compared to 81.6% in 2007. The impact of catastrophes in the third quarter of 2008 accounted for 13.6 percentage points of the combined ratio and was principally related to Hurricane Ike, including Chubb's estimated share of the assessment from the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association. In the third quarter of 2007, the impact of catastrophes accounted for 2.0 points. Excluding catastrophe losses, the third quarter combined ratio was 84.5% in 2008 and 79.6% in 2007. The expense ratio for the third quarter was 30.2% in 2008 and 29.8% in 2007.
     Property and casualty investment income after taxes for the third quarter increased 1% to $327 million in 2008 from $324 million in 2007.
 
     During the third quarter, Chubb repurchased 5,914,324 shares of its common stock at a total cost of $284 million. As of September 30, 2008, there were 3,400,882 shares of common stock remaining under the current repurchase authorization.
     "Obviously, losses from Hurricane Ike had a major adverse effect on our third quarter results," said John D. Finnegan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "However, despite these substantial catastrophe losses, we were still able to generate over $300 million in operating income, reflecting the continuing underlying strength of all our business units in a challenging environment. In addition, we were especially pleased with the performance of our high-quality investment portfolio in a period of unprecedented financial market turmoil."
Nine-Month Results
     For the first nine months of 2008, net income was $1.4 billion or $3.78 per share, compared with $2.2 billion or $5.33 per share for the first nine months of 2007. Net income for the first nine months of 2008 reflects net realized investment losses, including impairments, of $121 million before tax ($0.21 per share after-tax). Net income for the first nine months of 2007 includes net realized investment gains of $328 million before tax ($0.52 per share after-tax).
     Operating income for the first nine months of 2008 totaled $1.5 billion or $3.99 per share, compared with $1.9 billion or $4.81 per share for the first nine months of 2007.
     Total net written premiums for the first nine months remained flat at $8.9 billion. Premiums declined 3% in the U.S. and increased 11% outside the U.S. (4% in local currencies).
     The combined loss and expense ratio for the first nine months was 90.2% in 2008, compared to 82.6% in 2007. The impact of catastrophes in the first nine months of 2008 accounted for 6.9 percentage points of the combined ratio, compared to 2.8 points in the first nine months of 2007. The expense ratio for the first nine months was 30.2% in 2008 and 29.9% in 2007.
     Property and casualty investment income after taxes for the first nine months increased 4% to $981 million in 2008 from $942 million in 2007.
     During the first nine months, Chubb repurchased 22,711,788 shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1.1 billion.
 
Revised Guidance
     "We are revising our 2008 calendar year operating income per share guidance to a range of $5.45 to $5.55 from the $5.70 to $6.10 range we provided in July," said Mr. Finnegan. "This revised guidance is based on operating income per share of $3.99 in the first nine months and our forecast range of $1.46 to $1.56 for the fourth quarter.
     "The fourth quarter forecast assumes 2 percentage points of catastrophe losses in the quarter," said Mr. Finnegan. "This brings our catastrophe loss assumption for the year to 5.7 points, versus the assumption of 4 points in our July guidance. This higher catastrophe assumption, driven by the adverse effect of Hurricane Ike losses in the third quarter, accounts for virtually all of the downward revision in our 2008 full-year earnings guidance."
     Guidance and related assumptions are subject to the risks outlined in the company's forward-looking information safe harbor statement below.

Definitions of Key Terms
Operating Income
Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is measured based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
Book value per common share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income, the after-tax appreciation or depreciation on the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at fair value. The appreciation or depreciation on available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio
The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.

THE CHUBB CORPORATION
Beginning in the third quarter of 2008, the "net losses paid" and "increase (decrease) in outstanding losses" amounts in the property and casualty underwriting results reflect the impact of foreign currency fluctuations differently than in the past.
The property and casualty underwriting results for 2007 that follow this page reflect modification to previously reported net losses paid and increase (decrease) in outstanding losses. Since net losses paid and increase (decrease) in outstanding losses for each line of business and in total have been modified by offsetting amounts, incurred losses for each line of business and in total are unchanged.
