FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     WARREN, New Jersey, January 29, 2009  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] today reported that net income in the fourth quarter of 2008 was $407 million or $1.13 per share, compared to $650 million or $1.68 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007.
     Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, declined to $569 million from $620 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Operating income per share declined 1% to $1.58 from $1.60.
     Net written premiums for the fourth quarter were $2.9 billion, a decline of 4%; about half the decline was attributable to currency fluctuation. Premiums were down 2% in the U.S. and down 8% outside the U.S. (up 1% in local currencies).
     The fourth quarter combined loss and expense ratio was 84.3% in 2008 and 83.8% in 2007. Catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter of 2008 were negligible. The impact of catastrophes in the fourth quarter of 2007 accounted for 3.8 percentage points of the combined ratio. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 84.6% in 2008 and 80.0% in 2007. The expense ratio for the fourth quarter was 30.4% in 2008 and 30.5% in 2007.
     Property and casualty investment income after taxes for the fourth quarter was down 5% to $316 million in 2008 from $331 million in 2007, largely due to currency fluctuation and lower yields on short term investments.
 
     Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 reflects net realized investment losses, including impairments, of $250 million before tax ($0.45 per share after-tax), stemming primarily from the company's equity and alternative investments. The losses reflect the significant global decline in asset values during 2008. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 included net realized investment gains of $46 million before tax ($0.08 per share after-tax).
     During the fourth quarter of 2008, Chubb repurchased 3.6 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $164 million.
Full Year Results
     For the year ended December 31, 2008, net income was $1.8 billion or $4.92 per share, compared to $2.8 billion or $7.01 per share for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income for 2008 totaled $2.0 billion, compared to $2.6 billion in 2007. Operating income per share declined 13% to $5.58 in 2008 from $6.41 in 2007.
     Total net written premiums in 2008 decreased 1% to $11.8 billion. Currency fluctuation had an insignificant effect on total premium growth in 2008. Premiums were down 3% in the U.S. and up 6% outside the U.S. (up 3% in local currencies).
     The combined ratio in 2008 was 88.7%, compared to 82.9% in 2007. The impact of catastrophes accounted for 5.1 percentage points of the combined ratio in 2008 and 3.0 points in 2007. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the combined ratio was 83.6% in 2008 and 79.9% in 2007. The expense ratio for the year was 30.2% in 2008 and 30.1% in 2007.
     Property and casualty investment income after taxes increased 2% to $1.3 billion in 2008.
     Net income for 2008 reflected net realized investment losses, including impairments, of $371 million before tax ($0.66 per share after-tax). Net income for 2007 included net realized investment gains of $374 million before tax ($0.60 per share after-tax).
     During 2008, Chubb repurchased 26.3 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1.3 billion.
 
     "Chubb's operating income for all of 2008 was $2.0 billion, the third-highest achieved in any year in the corporation's history, thanks to significant contributions from all three business units," said John D. Finnegan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "This result was achieved in the face of high catastrophe losses for the year, deepening distress in many sectors of the global economy as well as declining insurance rates for the past four years. It is testimony to the unique strengths of Chubb's franchise and our ability to earn a strong underwriting profit in a variety of economic circumstances," he said.
     "While net income was adversely affected by continued turmoil in capital markets," said Mr. Finnegan, "the relatively modest size of our investment losses reflects the successful execution of our conservative philosophy in managing our $39 billion portfolio."

2009 Operating Income Guidance
     "We are encouraged by the improved rate environment in the fourth quarter," said Mr. Finnegan, "and there are good reasons to believe that this trend will continue into 2009. However, until we begin to see significantly higher rates materialize and work their way into earnings, we are basing our earnings guidance on rates being flat in 2009 versus 2008. Our 2009 underwriting profitability will continue to be impacted by the economic downturn and the cumulative effect of rate decreases experienced over the last four years. Operating income will also be further adversely affected by the impact of currency and lower yields on investments. Based on our current outlook, we believe we can achieve 2009 operating income per share in the range of $4.80 to $5.20."
 
     Mr. Finnegan said this guidance assumes a 3-to-4 percentage point impact of catastrophe losses on the 2009 combined ratio. The impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses on 2009 operating income per share is approximately $0.21.
     The operating income guidance for 2009 also assumes:
     The guidance and related assumptions are subject to the risks outlined in the company's forward-looking information safe-harbor statements (see below).

Definitions of Key Terms
Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Operating Income:
Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is measured based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Underwriting Income (Loss):
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax:
Book value per common share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), the after-tax appreciation or depreciation on the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at fair value. The appreciation or depreciation on available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost:
The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio:
: Management uses net written premiums growth excluding the impact of currency fluctuation, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the trends in net written premiums, exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which our international business is transacted.

Beginning in the third quarter of 2008, the "net losses paid" and "increase (decrease) in outstanding losses" amounts in the property and casualty underwriting results reflect the impact of foreign currency fluctuations differently than in the past.
The property and casualty underwriting results for 2007 that follow this page reflect modification to previously reported net losses paid and increase (decrease) in outstanding losses. Since net losses paid and increase (decrease) in outstanding losses for each line of business and in total have been modified by offsetting amounts, incurred losses for each line of business and in total are unchanged.
