Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          WARREN, New Jersey, January 28, 2010  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] today reported that net income in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $695 million or $2.03 per share, compared to $407 million or $1.13 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008.
          Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, was $569 million, the same as in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating income per share increased 5% to $1.66 from $1.58.
          Net written premiums for the fourth quarter were $2.8 billion, a decline of 4%; excluding the effect of currency fluctuation, premiums were down 5%. Premiums were down 8% in the U.S. and up 9% outside the U.S. (up 4% in local currencies).
          The fourth quarter combined loss and expense ratio was 84.7% in 2009 and 84.3% in 2008. The impact of fourth quarter catastrophe losses on the combined ratio was negligible in both 2009 and 2008. The expense ratio for the fourth quarter was 30.1% in 2009 and 30.4% in 2008.
          Property and casualty investment income after taxes for the fourth quarter was $317 million in 2009 and $316 million in 2008.
 
          Net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 included net realized investment gains of $193 million before tax ($0.37 per share after-tax), largely related to the company's alternative investments. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 reflected net realized investment losses of $250 million before tax ($0.45 per share after-tax), stemming primarily from impairments of equity securities and a decline in the value of alternative investments.
          During the fourth quarter of 2009, Chubb repurchased 9.8 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $489 million.
          Book value per share increased 4% to $47.09 at December 31, 2009  from $45.43 at the end of the third quarter.
Full Year Results
          For the year ended December 31, 2009, net income was $2.2 billion or $6.18 per share, compared to $1.8 billion or $4.92 per share for the year ended December 31, 2008. Operating income totaled $2.2 billion in 2009 and $2.0 billion in 2008. Operating income per share increased 10% to $6.14 in 2009 from $5.58 in 2008.
          Total net written premiums in 2009 decreased 6% to $11.1 billion from $11.8 billion in 2008; excluding the effect of currency fluctuation, premiums were down 4%. Premiums were down 6% in the U.S. and down 6% outside the U.S. (up 3% in local currencies).
          The combined ratio in 2009 was 86.0%, compared to 88.7% in 2008. The impact of catastrophes accounted for 0.8 percentage points of the combined ratio in 2009 and 5.1 points in 2008. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the combined ratio was 85.2% in 2009 and 83.6% in 2008. The expense ratio for the year was 30.6% in 2009 and 30.2% in 2008.
          Property and casualty investment income after taxes declined 3% in 2009 to $1.3 billion.
          Net income for 2009 included net realized investment gains of $23 million before tax ($0.04 per share after-tax). Net income for 2008 reflected net realized investment losses, including impairments, of $371 million before tax ($0.66 per share after-tax).
          During 2009, Chubb repurchased 22.6 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1.1 billion.
          Book value per share increased 23% to $47.09 at December 31, 2009 from $38.13 at 2008 year end.
 
          "We had a terrific fourth quarter, capping off another excellent year for Chubb," said John D. Finnegan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Chubb's operating income per share for 2009 was $6.14, the second-highest of any year in the corporation's history, driven by contributions from all three business units, all of which had combined ratios below 90% for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Given the difficult economic conditions that prevailed in 2009, we believe these results continue to distinguish Chubb and are clear evidence of our commitment to sustained bottom-line profitability."

Definitions of Key Terms
: Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Operating Income
: Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is measured based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
: Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
: Book value per common share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), the after-tax appreciation or depreciation, including unrealized other-than-temporary impairment losses, of the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at fair value. The appreciation or depreciation of available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
: The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio
: Management uses net written premiums growth (decrease) excluding the impact of currency fluctuation, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the trends in net written premiums, exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which our international business is transactedIn net written premiums growth (decrease) excluding the impact of currency fluctuation, the effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates is excluded as these rates may fluctuate significantly and could distort the analysis of trends. Net written premiums growth (decrease) excluding the impact of currency fluctuation is determined by using the same exchange rate to translate each foreign currency denominated net written premium amount in both periods.
