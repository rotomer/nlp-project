FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     WARREN, New Jersey, March 29, 2010  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE:CB] announced today that it estimates losses from first quarter catastrophes, which include the March Northeast U.S. storm, other U.S. winter storms, the Chilean earthquake, the Australian storms, European windstorm Xynthia and other catastrophe events, to be approximately $290 million pre-tax ($189 million after-tax). These amounts include estimated losses and loss expenses net of reinsurance recoverable and also include estimated reinsurance reinstatement premiums. Of the pre-tax losses, approximately $200 million represents Chubb's estimate for losses from U.S. catastrophes, of which $125 million was from the March Northeast U.S. storm. Losses from catastrophes outside the U.S. amounted to approximately $90 million pre-tax, of which $70 million was from the Chilean earthquake.
