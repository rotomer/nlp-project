Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     WARREN, New Jersey, October 21, 2010  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] today reported that net income in the third quarter of 2010 was $572 million or $1.80 per share, compared to $596 million or $1.69 per share in the third quarter of 2009.
     Average diluted shares outstanding for the third quarter were 317.3 million in 2010 and 353.5 million in 2009.
     Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, was $537 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared to $552 million in the third quarter of 2009. Operating income per share increased 8% to $1.69 from $1.56.
     The impact of catastrophes in the third quarter of 2010 was $58 million pre-tax, compared with $22 million pre-tax in the third quarter of 2009. The impact of catastrophes on third quarter net income and operating income per share was $0.12 in 2010 and $0.04 in 2009.
     Net written premiums for the third quarter of 2010 were up 1% to $2.7 billion. Foreign currency translation did not have a significant effect on premiums, which were flat in the U.S. and up 6% outside the U.S. (up 4% in local currencies).
     The third quarter combined loss and expense ratio was 86.2% in 2010, compared to 85.4% in 2009. The impact of catastrophes in the third quarter of 2010 accounted for 2.1 percentage points of the combined ratio, compared to 0.8 points in the third quarter of 2009. Excluding catastrophes, the combined ratio for the third quarter improved to 84.1% in 2010 from 84.6% in 2009.
 
     The expense ratio for the third quarter was 31.7% in 2010 and 31.2% in 2009.
     Property and casualty investment income after taxes for the third quarter was $317 million, unchanged from 2009.
     Net income for the third quarter of 2010 reflected net realized investment gains of $54 million pre-tax ($0.11 per share after-tax), compared to $69 million pre-tax ($0.13 per share after-tax) in the third quarter of 2009.
     During the third quarter, Chubb repurchased 10.2 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $555 million (an average cost of $54.63 per share). As of September 30, 2010, there were 6.6 million shares of common stock remaining under the current repurchase authorization.
     "In the third quarter, Chubb again demonstrated the ability to generate outstanding profitability and book value growth during a period of challenging economic and industry conditions," said John D. Finnegan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "By continuing our focus on the bottom line and maintaining our discipline in risk selection and pricing, all three business units produced excellent results.
     "Based on these results for the third quarter and our favorable outlook for the fourth quarter, we are increasing our 2010 full-year operating income per share guidance to a range of $5.75 to $5.85 from the previous guidance range of $5.15 to $5.55. This revised guidance is based on operating income per share of $4.22 in the first nine months and our forecast of a range of $1.53 to $1.63 for the fourth quarter," said Mr. Finnegan.
     The revised guidance for 2010 operating income per share assumes an impact from catastrophes of 2 percentage points in the fourth quarter, resulting in an assumed impact of catastrophes for the year of 5.8 points, compared to the assumption of 7 points in the previous guidance. The revised guidance assumes 322 million average diluted shares outstanding for the year.
     Guidance and related assumptions are subject to the risks outlined in the company's forward-looking information safe harbor statement below.
 
Nine-Month Results

Definitions of Key Terms
: Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Operating Income
: Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is measured based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
: Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
: Book value per common share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), the after-tax appreciation or depreciation, including unrealized other-than-temporary impairment losses, of the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at fair value. The appreciation or depreciation of available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
: The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio
: Management uses net written premiums growth (decrease) excluding the impact of currency fluctuation, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the trends in net written premiums, exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which our international business is transactedIn net written premiums growth (decrease) excluding the impact of currency fluctuation, the effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates is excluded as these rates may fluctuate significantly and could distort the analysis of trends. Net written premiums growth (decrease) excluding the impact of currency fluctuation is determined by using the same exchange rate to translate each foreign currency denominated net written premium amount in both periods.

The appreciation or depreciation of available-for-sale fixed maturities and equity securities is subject to fluctuation and could distort the analysis of trends. Average shareholders' equity excluding the after-tax unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments is the average of the beginning and all quarter-end balances within the period. Management uses operating return on equity, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the Corporation.
