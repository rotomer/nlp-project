FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     WARREN, New Jersey, January 27, 2011 The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] today reported that net income in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $620 million or $2.02 per share, compared to $695 million or $2.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009.
     Average diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter were 307.4 million in 2010 and 343.1 million in 2009.
     Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, was $519 million, compared to $569 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating income per share increased 2% to $1.69 from $1.66.
     Net written premiums for the fourth quarter were $2.9 billion, an increase of 3%. Premiums were up 2% in the U.S. and up 5% outside the U.S. (up 4% in local currencies).
     The fourth quarter combined loss and expense ratio was 87.0% in 2010 and 84.7% in 2009. The impact of catastrophes on the combined ratio was 1.4 percentage points in 2010 and negligible in 2009. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the combined ratio was 85.6% in 2010 and 84.7% in 2009. The expense ratio for the fourth quarter was 30.9% in 2010 and 30.1% in 2009.

     Net income for the fourth quarter of 2010 included net realized investment gains of $155 million before tax ($0.33 per share after-tax). Net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 reflected net realized investment gains of $193 million before tax ($0.37 per share after-tax). Gains in both periods were largely related to the company's alternative investments.
     During the fourth quarter of 2010, Chubb repurchased 8.1 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $473 million.
     Book value per share was $52.24 at December 31, 2010 compared to $52.41 at the end of the third quarter.

     During 2010, Chubb repurchased 37.7 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $2.0 billion.
     Book value per share increased 11% to $52.24 at December 31, 2010 from $47.09 at 2009 year end.
     "Chubb's excellent results in both the fourth quarter of 2010 and the full year continue to demonstrate our ability to generate superior financial results, even in a challenging economic and industry environment," said John D. Finnegan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Particularly noteworthy were combined ratios that were below 90% in both periods and $1.9 billion of operating income in 2010.
     "Our long-standing strategy of focusing on underwriting discipline combined with best-in-class producer relationships, a strong balance sheet and a conservative investment philosophy have enabled us to generate a very attractive average annual return on equity of 16% over the past five years," said Mr. Finnegan. "During this same period, we have also returned more than $10 billion of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our objective is to continue to deliver top-tier results in the future, regardless of the market environment. We believe that Chubb's unique franchise and our track record of successful execution will enable us to achieve this goal."

Definitions of Key Terms
: Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Operating Income
: Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is measured based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
: Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
: Book value per common share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), the after-tax appreciation or depreciation, including unrealized other-than-temporary impairment losses, of the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at fair value. The appreciation or depreciation of available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
: The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio
: Management uses net written premiums growth (decrease) excluding the impact of currency fluctuation, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the trends in net written premiums, exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which our international business is transactedIn net written premiums growth (decrease) excluding the impact of currency fluctuation, the effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates is excluded as these rates may fluctuate significantly and could distort the analysis of trends. Net written premiums growth (decrease) excluding the impact of currency fluctuation is determined by using the same exchange rate to translate each foreign currency denominated net written premium amount in both periods.
