FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     WARREN, New Jersey, June 20, 2011  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] announced today that it estimates aggregate losses from catastrophes for the months of April and May 2011 were approximately $250 million to $310 million before tax (approximately $0.55 to $0.68 per share after tax).

     Chubb expects to release second quarter 2011 earnings on Thursday, July 21, 2011 after the close of the market. The press release and financial supplement will be available shortly thereafter on Chubb's website at .
