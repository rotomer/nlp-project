FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
WARREN, New Jersey, January 26, 2012  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] today reported that net income in the fourth quarter of 2011 was $452 million or $1.60 per share, compared to $620 million or $2.02 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, was $460 million, compared to $519 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Operating income per share declined 4% to $1.63 from $1.69.
Net written premiums for the fourth quarter increased 4% to $3.0 billion from $2.9 billion. Premiums were up 3% in the U.S. and up 6% outside the U.S. (up 4% in local currencies).
The fourth quarter combined loss and expense ratio was 89.9% in 2011 and 87.0% in 2010. The impact of catastrophes on the combined ratio was 0.4 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2011. Losses from catastrophes that occurred in the fourth quarter were partially offset by a downward revision of estimated losses from Hurricane Irene and other catastrophes which occurred earlier in the year. The impact of catastrophes in the fourth quarter of 2010 was 1.4 points. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the combined ratio was 89.5% in 2011 and 85.6% in 2010. The expense ratio for the fourth quarter was 30.6% in 2011 and 30.9% in 2010.
 
 
Property and casualty investment income after taxes for the fourth quarter declined 1% to $316 million in 2011 from $320 million in 2010.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 included net realized investment losses of $12 million before tax ($0.03 per share after-tax). Net income for the fourth quarter of 2010 reflected net realized investment gains of $155 million before tax ($0.33 per share after-tax). The amounts in both periods were largely related to the company's alternative investments.
During the fourth quarter of 2011, Chubb repurchased 6.0 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $396 million, or an average cost of $66.10 per share.
Average diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter were 282.2 million in 2011 and 307.4 million in 2010.
Book value per share was $57.15 at December 31, 2011 compared to $56.23 at the end of the third quarter and $52.24 at December 31, 2010.
Full Year Results

Operating income totaled $1.5 billion in 2011 and $1.9 billion in 2010. Operating income per share declined 13% to $5.12 in 2011 from $5.90 in 2010.
Net written premiums in 2011 increased 5% to $11.8 billion from $11.2 billion in 2010; excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, premiums were up 4%. Premiums were up 2% in the U.S. and up 11% outside the U.S. (up 8% in local currencies).
The combined ratio in 2011 was 95.3%, compared to 89.3% in 2010. The impact of catastrophes accounted for 8.9 percentage points of the combined ratio in 2011 and 5.7 points in 2010. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the combined ratio was 86.4% in 2011 and 83.6% in 2010. The expense ratio for the year was 31.5% in 2011 and 31.2% in 2010.

Net income for 2010 reflected net realized investment gains of $426 million before tax ($0.86 per share after-tax). The amounts in both periods were largely related to the company's alternative investments.
During 2011, Chubb repurchased 27.6 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1.7 billion, or an average cost of $62.30 per share.
Average diluted shares outstanding were 291.4 million in 2011 and 321.6 million in 2010.
"Chubb had a solid fourth quarter with operating income per share of $1.63 and a combined ratio of 89.9%," said John D. Finnegan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We were very pleased to record $1.7 billion in net income for the year despite unprecedented levels of catastrophe losses. This reflects the strong underlying performance of all three of our business units.
"The fourth quarter was especially encouraging as the commercial rate environment continued to improve," said Mr. Finnegan. "We secured an average renewal rate increase of 6% in our U.S. standard commercial business, and average renewal rates in our U.S. professional liability business turned positive for the first time in two years. Given our strong balance sheet and underwriting discipline, we are well positioned to take advantage of these improving market conditions."

Definitions of Key Terms
: Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Operating Income
: Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is measured based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
: Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment results because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
Book value per common share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), the after-tax appreciation or depreciation, including unrealized other-than-temporary impairment losses, of the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at fair value. The appreciation or depreciation of available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost:
: The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio
: Management uses net written premiums growth (decrease) excluding the impact of currency fluctuation, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the trends in net written premiums, exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which international business is transacted In net written premiums growth (decrease) excluding the impact of currency fluctuation, the effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates is excluded as these rates may fluctuate significantly and could distort the analysis of trends. Net written premiums growth (decrease) excluding the impact of currency fluctuation is determined by using the same exchange rate to translate each foreign currency denominated net written premium amount in both periods.
