WARREN, New Jersey, July 26, 2012  The Chubb Corporation [NYSE: CB] today reported that net income in the second quarter of 2012 was $404 million compared to $419 million in the second quarter of 2011. Net income per share increased 4% to $1.48 from $1.42.
Operating income, which the company defines as net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses, was $374 million in the second quarter of 2012, the same as in the second quarter of 2011. Operating income per share increased 8% to $1.37 from $1.27.
Average diluted shares outstanding for the second quarter were 273.3 million in 2012 and 295.4 million in 2011.
The impact of catastrophes in the second quarter of 2012 was $223 million before tax ($0.53 per share after tax); catastrophe losses during the quarter were related primarily to severe hail and wind storms from 13 catastrophe events in the United States. In the second quarter of 2011, the impact of catastrophes was $329 million before tax ($0.72 per share after tax).
The second quarter combined loss and expense ratio was 93.8% in 2012 compared to 94.9% in 2011. The impact of catastrophes accounted for 7.5 percentage points of the combined ratio in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 11.3 points in the second quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the second quarter combined ratio was 86.3% in 2012 and 83.6% in 2011.
 
 
The expense ratio for the second quarter of 2012 was 31.3%, the same as in the corresponding year-earlier quarter.
Net written premiums for the second quarter of 2012 increased 1% to $3.1 billion. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, premiums were up approximately 2%. Premiums increased 3% in the U.S. and declined 3% outside the U.S. (increased 1% in local currencies).
Property and casualty investment income after taxes for the second quarter declined 5% to $303 million in 2012 from $318 million in 2011.
Net income for the second quarter of 2012 reflected net realized investment gains of $47 million before tax ($0.11 per share after-tax), compared to $69 million before tax ($0.15 per share after-tax) in the second quarter of 2011.
During the second quarter, Chubb repurchased approximately 4.3 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $305 million (an average of $71.63 per share). As of June 30, 2012, there remained approximately $658 million available for share repurchases under the current authorization.
"Chubb produced strong results in the second quarter of 2012 despite a high level of catastrophe losses," said John D. Finnegan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Although catastrophe losses had an adverse impact of $0.53 per share, we still generated operating income of $1.37 per share and net income of $1.48 per share. Our combined ratio of 86.3% excluding catastrophes reflected strong underlying performance.
"We are also encouraged by the continued upward momentum of rate increases in all our businesses," said Mr. Finnegan.
Six-Month Results
For the first six months of 2012, net income was $910 million or $3.31 per share compared with $928 million or $3.12 per share for the first half of 2011.

The impact of catastrophes in the first half accounted for 4.2 percentage points of the combined ratio in 2012 and 10.4 points in 2011. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the combined ratio in the first half was 87.8% in 2012 and 83.9% in 2011.

During the first six months of 2012, Chubb repurchased approximately 8.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $606 million (an average of $70.01 per share).
Outlook for 2012
"In light of our performance in the first half of the year and our outlook for the second half," said Mr. Finnegan, "we have increased our guidance for full year 2012 operating income per share to a range of $5.70 to $5.95 from the $5.30 to $5.70 range we provided in our January 2012 guidance. We have raised our guidance despite an increase in our catastrophe loss assumption for the full year from 3.5 percentage points to 4.3 points, largely reflecting higher than expected catastrophe losses in the first six months."
The impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses on 2012 full year operating income per share is approximately $0.28.
 
 
The revised guidance also assumes for full year 2012:

Definitions of Key Terms
: Operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, is net income excluding after-tax realized investment gains and losses. Management uses operating income, among other measures, to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any given period is largely discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly, which could distort the analysis of trends.
Operating Income
: Management evaluates underwriting results separately from investment results. The underwriting operations consist of four separate business units: personal insurance, commercial insurance, specialty insurance and reinsurance assumed. Performance of the business units is measured based on statutory underwriting results. Statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Under statutory accounting principles, policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately, not at the time premiums are earned. Statutory underwriting income (loss) is arrived at by reducing premiums earned by losses and loss expenses incurred and statutory underwriting expenses incurred.
Underwriting Income (Loss)
Management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with GAAP, among other measures, to assess the overall performance of the underwriting operations. To convert statutory underwriting results to a GAAP basis, certain policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned. Underwriting income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and GAAP underwriting expenses incurred.
: Management uses property and casualty investment income after income tax, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its investment results because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax.
Property and Casualty Investment Income After Income Tax
: Book value per common share represents the portion of consolidated shareholders' equity attributable to one share of common stock outstanding as of the balance sheet date. Consolidated shareholders' equity includes, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), the after-tax appreciation or depreciation, including unrealized other-than-temporary impairment losses, of the Corporation's available-for-sale fixed maturities, which are carried at fair value. The appreciation or depreciation of available-for-sale fixed maturities is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates and therefore could distort the analysis of trends. Management believes that book value per common share with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important measure of the underlying equity attributable to one share of common stock.
Book Value per Common Share with Available-for-Sale Fixed Maturities at Amortized Cost
: The combined loss and expense ratio, expressed as a percentage, is the key measure of underwriting profitability. Management uses the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the performance of the underwriting operations. It is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned (loss ratio) plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written (expense ratio) after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders.
Combined Loss and Expense Ratio or Combined Ratio
: Management uses net written premiums growth (decrease) excluding the impact of currency fluctuation, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the trends in net written premiums, exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which international business is transacted In net written premiums growth (decrease) excluding the impact of currency fluctuation, the effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates is excluded as these rates may fluctuate significantly and could distort the analysis of trends. Net written premiums growth (decrease) excluding the impact of currency fluctuation is determined by using the same exchange rate to translate each foreign currency denominated net written premium amount in both periods.
