ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS Sales for the three months ended May 31, 2002, declined 5-7%, compared with last year. o Demand for hazardous duty electrical construction materials declined in most major markets as a result of slowing nonresidential construction and project demand. o Continued softness in domestic industrial and commercial markets led to lower demand for lighting fixtures and wiring devices. o The decline in demand for circuit protection products has eased while sales of support systems and electrical enclosures continue to be considerably weakened by low end-user demand. o Continued uncertainty in the power delivery marketplace has hampered utilities' investments in distribution system products. Demand for distribution transformers and power management products remains weak. o UK and European demand for lighting fixtures and security products has slowed as a result of weaker European construction markets. o Competitive pressures continue to impact pricing in many markets. o It is estimated that currency translation effects were slightly negative. TOOLS AND HARDWARE Sales for the three months ended May 31, 2002, declined 18-20%, compared with last year. o Assembly equipment shipments to the auto industry are down from last year's levels. o Slowing industrial activity in North America and Europe has led to reduced demand for hand and power tools. o It is estimated that currency translation effects have been modestly negative.
