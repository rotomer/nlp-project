EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 22, 2002 Contact: John Breed Director, Media and Government Relations (713) 209-8835 COOPER INDUSTRIES REPORTS THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS OF 68 CENTS PER SHARE HOUSTON, TX, October 22, 2002 - Cooper Industries, Ltd. (NYSE:CBE) today reported third-quarter net income of $63.2 million, or $.68 per share (diluted), compared with net income of $74.3 million, or $.78 per share, for the third quarter of 2001. The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 on January 1, 2002; accordingly, goodwill has not been amortized since that date. If goodwill had not been amortized in the third quarter of 2001, comparable earnings would have been $.91 per share. Cooper's effective tax rate for the 2002 third quarter was 24 percent, reflecting the Company's May 22, 2002, reincorporation in Bermuda. This resulted in a benefit of approximately $.07 per share for the quarter. Revenues for the 2002 third quarter were $1.0 billion, compared with $1.05 billion for the same period last year. Operating earnings for the third quarter 2002 were $102.5 million, compared with $130.7 million for the third quarter 2001. "Cooper's third-quarter results were consistent with our expectations and reflect our continuing efforts to leverage our strong commercial position in a very difficult economic environment," said H. John Riley, Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer. "The broad-based economic recovery all of industrial America keeps hoping for has yet to materialize. As a result, we have not seen any meaningful upturn in our served markets. Appropriately, we are continuing to conservatively manage our businesses to reduce debt and further lower our cost base. Our efforts to maximize free cash flow and otherwise enhance the long-range competitive position of all of our businesses are working. -more-
COOPER INDUSTRIES PAGE 2 "Our free cash flow for the third quarter was a very strong $104 million, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $269 million, compared to $189 million for the same period last year. The Company's debt-to-total-capitalization ratio net of cash on September 30, 2002, was 37.3 percent, down from 37.9 percent at the end of the second quarter and 40.9 percent at the 2001 third-quarter end. "Despite the persistently sluggish and volatile economy, we are continuing to aggressively invest in important sales and marketing and new-product development initiatives to stimulate growth and increase market share," continued Riley. "Additionally, low-cost manufacturing initiatives are allowing us to further streamline the Company's production footprint. We plan to take a fourth-quarter pretax charge of approximately $30 million to close 10 manufacturing facilities. We expect that this action will result in cumulative net savings of over $35 million by 2004. "During the quarter, we also repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of Cooper stock in the open market at an average price of $30.15 per share. We plan to continue this program to buy back shares over the balance of the year. Market conditions make this a very opportune time to use our strong cash position to enhance long-term value for our shareholders. "We are confident that our strategic business investments and our vigorous restructuring efforts are positioning the Company for enhanced profitability and market leadership when the economy recovers." ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS Third-quarter 2002 revenues from the Electrical Products segment were down 3.4 percent, a smaller decline when compared with prior quarters. Revenues for the 2002 third quarter were $844.6 million, compared with $874.5 million for the same period last year. Segment revenues continued to be pressured by weak demand from industrial customers and a declining commercial construction market. This had a negative impact on the Company's hazardous-duty, lighting and support systems businesses. Revenues of power systems products also remained weak, reflecting pervasive uncertainty within utility markets during the quarter. The segment did, however, benefit from modest recovery in certain markets. Improved demand within fuse markets, particularly electronics, resulted in increased sales of circuit protection products. Revenues in the Company's wiring device business grew from greater participation in "big box" retail channels. Cooper's European lighting and security businesses -more-
COOPER INDUSTRIES PAGE 3 achieved revenue growth across all product lines as a result of positive market share shift. Segment operating earnings for the third quarter 2002 were $104.8 million, compared with $122.3 million for the same period last year. Third-quarter 2002 operating margins were 12.4 percent, reflecting lower production volumes, market pricing pressures and the impact of the Company's ongoing strategic business investments. TOOLS AND HARDWARE Third-quarter 2002 revenues in the Tools & Hardware segment were $154.7 million, compared with $177.3 million for the third quarter 2001. Revenues were impacted by lower shipments of assembly equipment to automotive markets and continued overall weak demand for industrial-grade hand and power tools throughout the world. Segment operating earnings for the 2002 third quarter were $7.4 million, compared with $16.1 million for the same period last year. Operating margins were 4.8 percent in the 2002 third quarter primarily due to plant inefficiencies resulting from lower volumes and planned inventory reductions throughout those businesses. Net segment inventory balances have been reduced by $47 million, or about 28 percent, since the beginning of 2002. OUTLOOK "At this point, we have no reason to be optimistic regarding fourth-quarter economic conditions," said Riley. "Indeed, we have seen few signs of significant upturn in any of our markets, and activity in the commercial construction sector is likely to deteriorate even further over the near term. Consistent with this outlook, excluding the anticipated fourth-quarter charge, we expect annual earnings to approximate $2.60 per share. Nonetheless, our focus on reducing costs in our businesses and maximizing cash flow will continue unabated. As a result, we expect that free cash flow at year-end will approximate a record $350 million."

EXHIBIT 99.2 SALES TRENDS Sales comparisons are presented to help investors understand the general tone of Cooper's business. These include the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, currency movements, etc. and are not necessarily indicative of business trends. Specific questions regarding sales trends should be directed to Richard Bajenski, Vice President, Investor Relations, bajenski@cooperindustries.com, (713) 209-8610. Sales for the three months ended on the date shown, compared to the same period in the prior year: OBSERVATIONS ON RECENT SALES TRENDS, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2002. COOPER INDUSTRIES Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2002, declined 5%, compared with last year. o Currency translation effects were slightly positive. ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2002, declined 3%, compared with last year. o Sales of hazardous duty electrical construction materials reflect continuing weakness in nonresidential construction and soft project demand. o Continued softness in domestic industrial and commercial construction markets led to lower demand for lighting fixtures, wiring devices and support products. Strength in residential construction has provided some offset for lighting fixtures and wiring devices. o Demand for electronic circuit protection products has picked up while sales of electronic enclosures continue to be considerably weakened by low end-user demand. o Continued uncertainty in the power delivery marketplace has hampered utilities' investments in distribution system products. Demand for distribution transformers and power management products remains weak. o Demand for European lighting fixtures and security products has improved despite weak European construction activity. o Competitive pressures continue to impact pricing in many markets. o Currency translation effects were slightly positive. TOOLS AND HARDWARE Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2002, declined 13%, compared with last year. o Automotive assembly equipment shipments are down from last year's levels due to lower worldwide automotive capital spending. o Slowing industrial activity in North America and Europe has led to reduced demand for hand and power tools. o Currency translation effects were slightly positive.
Note: Includes impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, when applicable.
