In the case of clause (1), the Company has included in such registration statements, as amended at the Effective Date, all information (other than Rule 430A Information) required by the Act and the rules thereunder to be included in such registration statements and the Final Prospectus. As filed, such final prospectus supplement or such amendment and form of final prospectus supplement shall contain all Rule 430A Information, together with all other such required information, and, except to the extent the Representatives shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in all substantive respects in the form furnished to you prior to the Execution Time or, to the extent not completed at the Execution Time, shall contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond that contained in the Basic Prospectus and any Preliminary Final Prospectus) as

(c) Each of the Company, the Guarantor and their respective significant subsidiaries has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is chartered or organized with requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease, as the case may be, and to operate its properties and conduct its business as described in the Final Prospectus, and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction which requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or have such power or authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, financial position or results of operations of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (a "Material Adverse Effect"). The subsidiaries listed in Schedule II to this Agreement are the only significant subsidiaries of the Guarantor or the Company, as defined by Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X. (d) The Guarantor has an authorized capitalization of 250 million shares

(g) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and the Guarantor and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company and the Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles (collectively, the "Enforceability Exceptions"). (h) The Indenture has been duly authorized by the Company and the Guarantor and, when duly executed and delivered in accordance with its terms by each of the parties thereto, will constitute a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company and the Guarantor enforceable against the Company and the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act. (i) The Securities have been duly authorized by the Company and, when duly executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement, will be duly and validly issued and outstanding will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture. The Guarantee has been duly authorized by the Guarantor and, when the Securities have been duly executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to this Agreement, will constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.

(s) Ernst & Young LLP, which has certified certain financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and delivered their report with respect to the audited consolidated financial statements and schedules included in the Final Prospectus, are independent public accountants with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder.

Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company or the Guarantor and delivered to the Representatives or counsel for the Underwriters in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company or the Guarantor, as to matters covered thereby, to each Underwriter. 2. Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at a purchase price of 98.824% of the principal amount thereof, the principal amount of the Securities set forth opposite such Underwriter's name in Schedule I hereto. 3. Delivery and Payment. Delivery of and payment for the Securities shall be made at 10:00 AM, New York City time, on October 28, 2002, or at such time on such later date not more than three Business Days after the foregoing date as the Representatives shall designate, which date and time may be postponed by agreement between the Representatives and the Company or as provided in Section 9 hereof (such date and time of delivery and payment for the Securities being herein called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Securities shall be made to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters against payment by the several Underwriters through the Representatives of the purchase price thereof to or upon the order of the Company by wire transfer payable in same-day Federal funds to an account specified by the Company. Delivery of the Securities shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company unless the Representatives shall otherwise instruct. 4. Offering by Underwriters. It is understood that the several Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale to the public as set forth in the Final Prospectus. 5. Agreements. The Company and the Guarantor agree with the several Underwriters that: (a) The Company and the Guarantor will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement, if not effective at the Execution Time, and any amendment thereof, to become effective. Prior to the termination of the offering of the Securities, the Company and the Guarantor will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement (including the Final Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus) to the Basic Prospectus or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement unless either the Company or the Guarantor has furnished you a copy for your review prior to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, if the Registration Statement has become or becomes
11 effective pursuant to Rule 430A, or filing of the Final Prospectus is otherwise required under Rule 424(b), the Company or the Guarantor will cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule 424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Representatives of such timely filing. The Company or the Guarantor will promptly advise the Representatives (1) when the Registration Statement, if not effective at the Execution Time, shall have become effective, (2) when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed (if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) or when any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement shall have been filed with the Commission, (3) when, prior to termination of the offering of the Securities, any amendment to the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (4) of any request by the Commission or its staff for any amendment of the Registration Statement, or any Rule 462(b) Registration Statement, or for any supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (5) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and (6) of the receipt by the Company or the Guarantor of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the institution or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose. The Company and the Guarantor will use their reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof. (b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly will (1) notify the Representatives of such event; (2) prepare and file with the Commission, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement which will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; and (3) supply any supplemented Final Prospectus to you in such quantities as you may reasonably request. (c) As soon as practicable, the Guarantor will make generally available to its security holders and to the Representatives an earnings statement or statements of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 under the Act.
12 (d) The Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, signed copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto) and to each other Underwriter a copy of the Registration Statement (without exhibits thereto) and, so long as delivery of a prospectus by an Underwriter or dealer may be required by the Act, as many copies of each Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and any supplement thereto as the Representatives may reasonably request. The Company and/or the Guarantor will pay the expenses of printing or other production of all documents relating to the offering. (e) The Company and the Guarantor will arrange, if necessary, for the qualification of the Securities (including the Guarantee) for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for the distribution of the Securities and will pay any fee of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., in connection with its review of the offering; provided that in no event shall the Company or the Guarantor be obligated to: (1) qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where they are not now so qualified, (2) take any action that would subject them to service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the offering or sale of the Securities (including the Guarantee), in any jurisdiction in which they are not now so subject, or (3) subject themselves to taxation in any jurisdiction in which they are not otherwise so subject. (f) Neither the Company nor the Guarantor will, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction which is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition (whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash settlement or otherwise) by the Company or any affiliate of the Company or any person in privity with the Company or any affiliate of the Company), directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in the filing) of a registration statement with the Commission in respect of, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or the Guarantor and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue (other than the Securities and the Guarantee) or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction for a period of 90 days following the Execution Time. (g) Neither the Company nor the Guarantor will take, directly or indirectly, any action designed to or which has constituted or which might reasonably be expected to cause or result, under the Exchange Act or otherwise, in stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Securities or the Guarantee. 6.

(b) The Company shall have requested and caused Squire, Sanders & Dempsey L.L.P., counsel for the Company and the Guarantor, (ii) Appleby, Spurling & Kempe, Bermuda counsel for the Guarantor and (iii) Diane K. Schumacher, General Counsel to the Company and the Guarantor, to have furnished to the Representatives their opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, to the effect set forth in Annexes A, B and C, respectively, hereto. In rendering such opinions, such counsel may rely (A) as to matters involving the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the States of Ohio and New York or the Federal laws of the United States, to the extent they deem proper and specified in such opinions, upon the opinion of other counsel of good standing whom they believe to be reliable and who are satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters and (B) as to matters of fact, to the extent they deem proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and the Guarantor and public officials. (c) The Representatives shall have received from Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, with respect to the issuance and sale of the Securities (including the Guarantee), the Indenture, the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus (together with any supplement thereto) and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably require, and the Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.
14 (d) The Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to the Representatives a certificate of the Company and the Guarantor, signed by an executive officer of the Company and of the Guarantor who has specific knowledge of the Company's and Guarantor's financial matters and who is satisfactory to the Representatives, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration Statement, the Final Prospectus, any supplements to the Final Prospectus and this Agreement and that: (i) the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the Company and the Guarantor have complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the conditions on their part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) no stop-order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or, to the Company's or the Guarantor's knowledge, threatened; and (iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there has been no material adverse change or any development involving a prospective material adverse change in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). (e) At the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, Ernst & Young LLP shall have furnished to the Representatives, at the request of the Company and the Guarantor, letters, dated respectively as of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date and addressed to the Representatives, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives, containing statements and information of the type customarily included in accountants' "comfort letters" to underwriters with respect to the financial statements and certain financial information contained or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, provided that the letter delivered on the Closing Date shall use a "cut-off" date no more than three business days prior to the Closing Date. (f) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto), there
15 shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified in the letter or letters referred to in paragraph (e) of this Section 6 or (ii) any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business or properties of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto) the effect of which, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, so material and adverse as to make it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Registration Statement (exclusive of any amendment thereof) and the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). (g) Subsequent to the Execution Time, there shall not have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's or the Guarantor's debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act) or any notice given of any intended or potential decrease in any such rating or of a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change. (h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and the Guarantor shall have furnished to the Representatives such further information, certificates and documents as the Representatives may reasonably request. If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters, this Agreement and all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by the Representatives. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company and the Guarantor in writing or by telephone or facsimile confirmed in writing. The documents required to be delivered by this Section 6 shall be delivered at the office of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett, counsel for the Underwriters, at 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, on the Closing Date. 7. Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses. If the sale of the Securities provided for herein is not consummated because any condition to the obligations of the Underwriters set forth in Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to Section 10 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of the Company or the Guarantor to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof other than by reason of a default by any of the Underwriters, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters severally through Salomon Smith Barney Inc. on demand for all out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements
16 of counsel) that shall have been incurred by them in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of the Securities. 8. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company and the Guarantor jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Guarantor will be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein; provided, further, that with respect to any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission of material fact made in any Preliminary Final Prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 8(a) shall not inure to the benefit of any Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability purchased the Securities concerned, to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such Underwriter occurs under the circumstance where it shall have been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment that (w) the Company or the Guarantor had previously furnished copies of the Final Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference therein) to the Representatives, (x) delivery of the Final Prospectus was required by the Act to be made to such person, (y) the untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Final Prospectus was corrected in the Final Prospectus and (z) there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such securities to such person, a copy of the Final Prospectus. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Company and the Guarantor may otherwise have. (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Guarantor, each of their respective directors, each of their respective officers, and each person who controls the Company or the Guarantor
17 within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and the Guarantor to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company or the Guarantor by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability, which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company and the Guarantor acknowledge that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and, under the heading "Underwriting" or "Plan of Distribution", (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances and (iii) the paragraphs related to stabilization, over-allotment transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, in any of which events such fees, costs and
18 expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested that an indemnifying party reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the indemnifying party of such request and (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding. (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company, the Guarantor and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; provided, however, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantor on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company and the Guarantor shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company or the Guarantor on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the
19 intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company or the Guarantor within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company or the Guarantor who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company or the Guarantor shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantor, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d). 9. Default by an Underwriter. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; provided, however, that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter, the Company or the Guarantor. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company, the Guarantor and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder. 10. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company and the Guarantor prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Guarantor's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange or trading in securities generally on the
20 New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto). 11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company and the Guarantor or their officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company, the Guarantor or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement. 12. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Representatives, will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to the Salomon Smith Barney Inc. General Counsel (fax no.: (212) 816-7912) and confirmed to the General Counsel, Salomon Smith Barney Inc., at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York, 10013 Attention: General Counsel; or, if sent to the Company or the Guarantor will be mailed, delivered or telefaxed to Cooper Industries, Inc. 600 Travis, Suite 5800, Houston, Texas 77002 (Fax No.: (713) 209-8983), Attention: Vice President and Treasurer. 13. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers, directors, employees, agents and controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. 14. Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be performed within the State of New York. 15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 16. Headings.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the acceptance and purchase of the Notes by the holders thereof, it is mutually covenanted and agreed as follows: 1
SECTION 1. The Indenture is hereby amended, solely with respect to the Notes and any Subsequent Debentures, by the addition of Section 4.04 as follows: Section 4.04. Optional Redemption For Tax Reasons. The Company shall be entitled to redeem all, but not part, of the Debentures if as a result of any change in or amendment to the laws, regulations or rulings of the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction or any change in the official application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, or any change in the official application or interpretation of, or any execution of or amendment to, any treaty or treaties affecting taxation to which such Relevant Tax Jurisdiction is a party (a "Change in Tax Law"), the Payor is or would be required on the occasion of the next payment of principal or interest in respect of the Debentures to pay Additional Amounts pursuant to Section 5.09 and the payment of such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the use of any reasonable measures available to the Payor. The Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the original issue date with respect to the Debentures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article IV, the Company must (i) deliver to the trustee at least 30 days before the redemption date an opinion of independent legal counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Payor has or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of such Change in Tax Law and (ii) provide the holders with notice of the intended redemption at least 30 days and no more than 60 days before the redemption date. The redemption price will equal the principal amount of the Debentures plus accrued interest to the redemption date. SECTION 2. The Indenture is hereby amended, solely with respect to the Notes and any Subsequent Debentures, by adding to Section 1.01 thereof the following definitions in correct alphabetical order: Additional Amounts: The term "Additional Amounts" shall have the meaning specified in Section 5.09. Change in Tax Law: The term "Change in Tax Law" shall have the meaning specified in Section 4.04. Payor: The term "Payor" shall have the meaning specified in Section 5.09. Relevant Tax Jurisdiction: The term "Relevant Tax Jurisdiction" shall have the meaning specified in Section 5.09. 2
SECTION 3. The Indenture is hereby amended, solely with respect to the Notes and any Subsequent Debentures, by the addition of Section 5.09 as follows: Section 5.09. Payment of Additional Amounts. If any taxes, assessments or other governmental charges are imposed by the jurisdiction, other than the United States, where the Guarantor or a successor (a "Payor") is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, any jurisdiction, other than the United States, from or through which the Payor makes a payment on the Debentures, or, in each case, any political organization or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (the "Relevant Tax Jurisdiction") in respect of any payments under the Debentures, the Payor shall pay to each holder of a Debenture, to the extent it may lawfully do so, such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts paid to such holder will be not less than the amount specified in such Debenture to which such holder is entitled; provided, however, the Payor shall not be required to make any payment of Additional Amounts for or on account of: (a) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which would not have been imposed but for (i) the existence of any present or former connection between such holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such holder, if such holder is an estate, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction including, without limitation, such holder (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, shareholder or possessor) being or having been a citizen or resident thereof or being or having been present or engaged in trade or business therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein or (ii) the presentation of a Debenture (where presentation is required) for payment on a date more than 30 days after (x) the date on which such payment became due and payable or (y) the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later; (b) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge; (c) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which is payable otherwise than by withholding from payment of (or in respect of) principal of, premium, if any, or any interest on, the Debentures; (d) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the holder or the beneficial owner of the Debenture to comply with a request of the Payor addressed to the holder to provide information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the holder or such beneficial owner which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the taxing jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such tax, assessment or other governmental charge; or (e) any combination of the above; 3
nor will Additional Amounts be paid with respect to any payment of the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any Debenture to any holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or limited liability company or other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent such payment would be required by the laws of the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction to be included in the income for tax purposes of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership, limited liability company or beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to such Additional Amounts had it been the holder of such Debenture. The Payor shall provide the Trustee with the official acknowledgment of the relevant tax authority (or, if such acknowledgment is not available, a certified copy thereof) evidencing the payment of the withholding taxes by the Payor. Copies of such documentation shall be made available to the holders of the Debentures or the paying agent, as applicable, upon request therefor. SECTION 4. The Indenture, as supplemented and amended by this Supplemental Indenture and all other supplemental indentures thereto, is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto shall be read, taken and construed as one and the same instrument; provided, however, that this Supplemental Indenture shall apply only to the Notes and any Subsequent Debentures. SECTION 5. If and to the extent any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision hereof which is required to be included in this Supplemental Indenture by any provision of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, such required provision shall control. SECTION 6. In case any provision in this Supplemental Indenture or in the Debentures of any series shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or of the other series of Debentures) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. SECTION 7. If the provisions of the Notes or any series of the Subsequent Debentures issued hereunder are inconsistent or conflict with the provisions of this Supplemental Indenture, the provisions of the Notes or the Subsequent Debentures of such series shall be controlling with respect to such series. SECTION 8. This Supplemental Indenture and each Debenture of any series shall be deemed to be a contract made under the laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the said State. SECTION 9. Capitalized terms used in this Supplemental Indenture that are not otherwise defined herein that are defined in the Indenture shall remain as set forth therein. 4
SECTION 10. This Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. SECTION 11. The Trustee shall not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for or in respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Third Supplemental Indenture or for or in respect of the recitals contained herein, all of which are made solely by the Company and the Guarantor. 5
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Third Supplemental Indenture to be duly executed and their respective corporate seals to be hereunto affixed and attested, as of the day and year first above written.
