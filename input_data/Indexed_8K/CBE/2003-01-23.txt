EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 23, 2003 Contact: John Breed Director, Media and Government Relations (713) 209-8835 COOPER INDUSTRIES REPORTS EARNINGS OF $.62 PER SHARE FOR THE 2002 FOURTH QUARTER Company generates record free cash flow of $428 million for the year HOUSTON, TX, January 23, 2003 - Cooper Industries, Ltd. (NYSE:CBE) today reported net income for the fourth quarter 2002 of $57.6 million, or $.62 per share (diluted), before a nonrecurring after-tax charge. These earnings are consistent with the Company's previously stated projections and Wall Street consensus estimates for the quarter. The Company's quarterly free cash flow totaled $161 million, bringing free cash flow to a record $428 million for the full year 2002. Cooper's 2002 fourth-quarter net income of $57.6 million and per-share earnings of $.62 compare with 2001 fourth-quarter net income of $57.1 million, or $.60 cents per share, before nonrecurring charges, a favorable income tax settlement and a provision related to potential obligations for discontinued operations. Fourth-quarter 2002 revenues were $985.0 million, compared with $989.6 million for the fourth quarter 2001. Operating earnings before nonrecurring charges were $96.1 million in the 2002 fourth quarter, compared with $105.6 million before nonrecurring items for the same period in 2001. The Company took a $29.8 million, or $.32 per share, nonrecurring after-tax charge in the 2002 fourth quarter, resulting in fourth-quarter 2002 net income of $27.8 million, or $.30 per share. This compares with net income of $32.6 million, or $.34 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2001. The 2002 fourth-quarter charge consisted of a provision for costs related to the closure of 10 manufacturing facilities, further employment reductions to appropriately size the - more -
COOPER INDUSTRIES PAGE 2 Company's workforce to market conditions and the write-off of assets related to ongoing production rationalization activities. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142. Accordingly, goodwill has not been amortized since that date. If goodwill had not been amortized in the fourth quarter of 2001, comparable earnings would have been $.48 per share. In addition, Cooper's effective tax rate for the 2002 fourth quarter was 24 percent, reflecting the Company's May 22, 2002, reincorporation in Bermuda. After taking into consideration the tax benefit impact of the fourth-quarter 2002 nonrecurring charges, this resulted in a net benefit of approximately $.03 per share for the quarter. Cooper's net income for 2002 was $213.7 million, or $2.28 per share, compared with $231.3 million, or $2.44 per share, for 2001. If goodwill had not been amortized in 2001, comparable earnings would have been $2.97 per share. The approximate benefit of Cooper's reincorporation in Bermuda for all of 2002 was $.24 per share. Before nonrecurring charges, the Company's net income for 2002 was $243.5 million, or $2.60 per share. Comparable net income for 2001 before nonrecurring items was $255.8 million, or $2.69 per share. Cooper's annual 2002 revenues were $3.96 billion, compared with 2001 revenues of $4.21 billion. Annual 2002 operating earnings before nonrecurring charges were $393.8 million, compared with $475.2 million before nonrecurring items for 2001. Free cash flow for 2002 was $428 million, before dividends. This compares with free cash flow of $314 million for 2001. As a result, the Company's debt-to-total-capitalization ratio net of cash at December 31, 2002, was 36.2 percent, down significantly from 38.9 percent net of cash at December 31, 2001. During 2002, the Company repurchased approximately 2.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $33.63 per share, bringing total shares outstanding to 91.7 million at year-end. "Cooper had a very solid performance in 2002," said H. John Riley, Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Persistent weakness in our important commercial construction and industrial markets, the resulting operational inefficiencies and marketplace pricing pressures all negatively impacted our performance for the year. Despite this, we produced respectable earnings and outstanding cash flow, allowing us to substantially improve our financial position, pay a very significant dividend to our shareholders and continue to fund key investments in our businesses. "Throughout 2002, we continued to size production capacity and adjust employment levels to prevailing market conditions, while concurrently investing in important commercial
COOPER INDUSTRIES PAGE 3 growth activities and new product development initiatives," said Riley. "We also launched broad-based programs to improve asset utilization and further reduce manufacturing costs. Likewise, we continued to aggressively move forward to enhance our global manufacturing and strategic sourcing footprint. We fully expect that all of these actions will have a substantial beneficial impact on our results when commercial activity increases." ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS Revenues from the Electrical Products segment for the 2002 fourth quarter were $817.5 million, compared with $821.1 million for the same period last year. Segment operating earnings for the fourth quarter 2002 were $96.1 million, compared with $99.2 million for the same period last year, both before nonrecurring charges. Operating margins in the 2002 fourth quarter were 11.8 percent before nonrecurring charges, reflecting aggressive actions to reduce inventory levels, the impact of ongoing investments in strategic growth programs, and a $2.2 million write-off for receivables from a major electrical distributor that declared bankruptcy. Persistent weakness in commercial construction and industrial markets impacted sales of the Company's lighting, hazardous-duty and support systems products. The impact of these weak markets was partially offset by strong retail channel sales during the quarter, particularly for the Company's residential lighting and wiring devices products. Revenues of power systems products were lower than in the prior year due to lingering uncertainty within utility markets. A modest recovery in electronic markets led to an increase in sales of circuit-protection products, compared to the fourth-quarter of 2001. Fourth quarter sales of the Company's European lighting and security business grew as a result of continuing market share gains. Full-year 2002 revenues for the Electrical Products segment were $3.32 billion, compared with $3.49 billion in 2001. Operating earnings for 2002 were $400.6 million, compared with $437.0 million in 2001, both before nonrecurring charges. TOOLS AND HARDWARE Fourth-quarter 2002 revenues in the Tools & Hardware segment were $167.5 million, compared with the 2001 fourth quarter's $168.5 million. Although 2002 fourth-quarter revenues improved from the prior quarter, the segment continues to be impacted by overall weak demand from U.S. industrial markets for hand and power tools.
COOPER INDUSTRIES PAGE 4 Segment operating earnings in the 2002 fourth quarter totaled $10.6 million before nonrecurring charges, compared with $14.1 million for the same period last year. Operating margins were 6.3 percent before nonrecurring charges in the 2002 fourth quarter, as planned inventory reductions and investments to increase selling and marketing efforts continued throughout these businesses. Full-year Tools & Hardware revenues were $635.6 million in 2002, compared with $724.0 million for the prior year. Annual operating earnings for the Tools & Hardware segment were $27.3 million before nonrecurring charges in 2002, compared with $68.6 million in 2001. OUTLOOK "The strength of Cooper's global franchise enabled us to perform very well in 2002 in the face of a very tough market environment," continued Riley. "We intend to continue to capitalize on our solid business platform throughout 2003 to generate increased revenues and earnings and continued strong cash flow. "Our businesses and their brands hold leading positions in their respective markets. We will further penetrate these markets through unique marketing and sales initiatives like our Cooper Connection program and the addition of new and innovative products engineered and manufactured with superior quality for significantly lower cost. During 2003, we also will expand our Strategic Sourcing initiative and implement a Company-wide lean manufacturing system to strengthen our production platform and increase productivity. Additionally, we will launch a new broad-based 'Get Connected' initiative to electronically leverage and integrate throughout the Company the strengths inherent in each of our businesses. "Like most others who deal in the markets we serve, we do not anticipate any meaningful improvement in business conditions for the better part of 2003," said Riley. "That said, Cooper is competitively positioned today, and we expect that the strategic improvement programs and commercial initiatives that we are implementing will generate growth and earnings even if markets remain flat. As a result, we currently anticipate that Cooper's full-year 2003 earnings will be in a range of $2.85 to $3.05 per share."

EXHIBIT 99.2 SALES TRENDS Sales comparisons are presented to help investors understand the general tone of Cooper's business. These include the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, currency movements, etc. and are not necessarily indicative of business trends. Specific questions regarding sales trends should be directed to Richard Bajenski, Vice President, Investor Relations, bajenski@cooperindustries.com, (713) 209-8610. Sales for the three months ended on the date shown, compared to the same period in the prior year: OBSERVATIONS ON RECENT SALES TRENDS, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002. COOPER INDUSTRIES Sales for the three months ended December 31, 2002, were essentially flat compared with last year. o Currency translation effects were slightly positive. ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS Sales for the three months ended December 31, 2002, were essentially flat compared with last year. o Continued strength in retail markets, a result of residential construction activity and favorable channel shift, has led to increased sales of wiring devices and lighting fixtures in these markets. o Commercial construction remains soft resulting in lower demand for lighting fixtures, wiring devices and support structures in these markets. o Weakness in industrial MRO and project markets continues to impact demand for hazardous duty electrical construction materials and electrical circuit protection products. Sales of some MRO products are higher reflecting a return to more normal inventory levels after a period of inventory reductions. o Electronics and telecom markets remain sluggish, resulting in weak demand for enclosures. Despite these conditions, sales for circuit protection devices to serve these markets have increased due to successful new products and market penetration. o Market uncertainty in the power delivery portion of utility markets persists, delaying investment in distribution system products. Demand for distribution transformers and power management products remains weak. o Sales for European lighting fixtures and security products weakened as a result of declining European construction markets. o Competitive pressures continue to impact pricing in most markets. o Currency translation effects were slightly positive. TOOLS AND HARDWARE Sales for the three months ended December 31, 2002, declined 1%, compared with last year. o Automotive assembly equipment shipments are returning to historical levels after a period of lower worldwide automotive capital spending. o Slowing industrial activity in North America and Europe has led to reduced demand for hand and power tools. o Currency translation effects were slightly positive. Note: Includes impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, when applicable.
