COOPER INDUSTRIES - ----------------- Sales for the three months ended February 28, 2003, declined 0-2% compared with last year. o Currency translation effects were slightly positive. ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS - ------------------- Sales for the three months ended February 28, 2003, declined 1-3% compared with last year. o Retail markets are relatively flat, a result of residential construction activity remaining at a high level. o Commercial construction remains soft resulting in lower demand for lighting fixtures, wiring devices and support structures in these markets. o Weakness in industrial MRO and project markets continues to impact demand for hazardous duty electrical construction materials and electrical circuit protection products. o Electronics and telecom markets remain sluggish, resulting in weak demand for enclosures. Despite these conditions, sales for circuit protection devices to serve these markets have increased due to successful new products and market penetration. o Market uncertainty in the power delivery portion of utility markets persists, delaying investment in distribution system products. Demand for distribution transformers and power management products remains weak. o Sales for European lighting fixtures and security products weakened as a result of declining European construction markets. o Competitive pressures have impacted pricing in most markets compared to a year ago. o Currency translation effects were slightly positive. TOOLS AND HARDWARE - ------------------ Sales for the three months ended February 28, 2003, declined 0-2% compared with last year. o Automotive assembly equipment shipments are currently below prior year levels due to shipment schedules. o Weak but stable industrial activity in North America and Europe has led to flat demand for hand and power tools. o Currency translation effects were slightly positive. Note: Includes impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, when applicable.
