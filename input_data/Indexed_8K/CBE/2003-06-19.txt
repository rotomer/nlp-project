(NYSE:CBE) today announced several key organizational changes in its senior management structure in order to facilitate a planned management succession and to more effectively respond to current marketplace demands. Ralph E. Jackson, Jr., chief operating officer and deputy chairman, has announced his intention to retire from the Company by the end of 2003. Until his retirement, Jackson will continue as deputy chairman and as a member of the Company's Board of Directors and also will provide oversight for the Company's Tools & Hardware businesses. "Ralph has served Cooper Industries with dedication and distinction for 27 years," said H. John Riley, Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer. "He has played a vital role in enhancing Cooper's reputation for operational and customer service excellence, while helping to execute our strategy of transforming the Company into a global manufacturer of electrical products and tools and hardware with market-leading performance." In light of Ralph Jackson's decision, Kirk S. Hachigian, executive vice president, will immediately assume a broadened level of responsibilities as executive vice president and chief operating officer, Electrical Products. In this role, Hachigian will have direct oversight of all of the Company's electrical products businesses, including Cooper Power Systems headquartered in Waukesha, Wis., and Cooper Menvier, headquartered in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, U.K. - more -

"He has helped to effectively globalize the Company's scope and scale through important, value added initiatives.

Schumacher, senior vice president and general counsel, has been designated as the Company's chief compliance officer with responsibility for monitoring and ensuring compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to Cooper throughout the world.

Sheil will take on an expanded role as the Company's senior vice president, Human Resources and chief administrative officer and will assume responsibility for the Company's Public Affairs function. As a result, Victoria Guennewig, vice president, Public Affairs, will report directly to Sheil.
