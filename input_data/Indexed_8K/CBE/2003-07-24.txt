EXHIBIT INDEX

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE July 24, 2003 Contact: John Breed Director, Media and Government Relations (713) 209-8835 COOPER INDUSTRIES REPORTS SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS Revenues and segment operating earnings improve sequentially HOUSTON, TX, July 24, 2003 - Cooper Industries, Ltd. (NYSE:CBE) today reported second-quarter 2003 net income of $72.4 million, or $.78 per share (diluted), compared with net income of $73.9 million, or $.78 per share, for the second quarter of 2002. As anticipated, second-quarter 2003 net income includes $8.6 million, or $.09 per share, after tax, for the reversal of an accrual related to the Company's 2001 review of strategic alternatives. During the 2003 second quarter, the Company also concluded that no income would be recognized from an agreement related to the 1993 initial public offering of a subsidiary. In the 2002 second quarter, pretax income from this agreement was approximately $3 million. Revenues for the 2003 second quarter were $1.01 billion, compared with $1.00 billion for the same period in 2002. Operating earnings for the second quarter 2003 were $99.3 million, compared with $106.8 million for the 2002 second quarter. The effective tax rate for the 2003 second quarter was 20 percent, excluding the impact of the reversal of the accrual related to the Company's 2001 review of strategic alternatives. "Like others serving our markets, we continued to face considerable economic headwinds during the second quarter," said H. John Riley, Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Commercial and industrial construction persisted at disappointingly low levels, and manufacturing activity overall showed few signs of improvement. Given this environment, we were pleased to report sequentially improved revenues and segment operating margins for the quarter. This is a solid indication that we continue to perform well in a very difficult end-user market environment and that we are realizing improved results from our market penetration and productivity improvement initiatives.
COOPER INDUSTRIES, LTD. PAGE 2 "We also continued to strengthen our financial position during the quarter. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $115.9 million, and we are on target to meet or exceed our $275 million free-cash-flow objective for 2003. Our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio on June 30, 2003, was 38.6 percent. Taking into account $169 million of cash on hand at quarter-end, this ratio would have been 35.4 percent," said Riley. Earnings per share for the first half of 2003 were $1.39, compared with $1.30 for the same period in 2002. Net income for the first six months of 2003 was $129.0 million, compared with $122.7 million for the first six months of last year. Revenues for the first half of 2003 were $1.97 billion, compared with $1.98 billion for the same period in 2002. Operating earnings in the first half of 2003 were $190.1 million, compared with $195.2 million for the 2002 first half. Here again, the Company's effective tax rate for the first half of 2003 was 20 percent, excluding the impact of the reversal of the accrual related to the Company's 2001 review of strategic alternatives. SEGMENT RESULTS Second-quarter 2003 revenues from the ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS segment were $839.0 million, compared with $843.3 million for the 2002 second quarter. The weakened U.S. dollar increased reported revenues for the segment by approximately 2 percent. Operating earnings for the segment in the 2003 second quarter were $109.2 million, compared with $107.9 million for the same period last year. Second-quarter 2003 operating margins were 13.0 percent, compared to 12.8 percent in the 2002 second quarter, and much improved from 12.5 percent in the first quarter of 2003. The Company saw double-digit growth in retail channel sales during the quarter, particularly in residential lighting products, as "big box" chains continued to expand their market coverage. However, persistent weakness in the Company's key industrial and commercial construction markets negatively impacted almost all of the Company's other electrical products businesses. Revenues of the Company's hazardous-duty products continue to be impacted by sluggish petrochemical project activity. Lower revenues of power transmission and distribution equipment resulted from the uncertainty which lingers in utility markets. Revenues in the Company's European lighting and security business grew nearly 11 percent as a result of currency translation. Year-to-date 2003 revenues for the Electrical Products segment were $1.64 billion, compared with $1.66 billion for the same period in 2002. Operating earnings for the segment for the first half of 2003 were $209.5 million, compared with $199.7 million for the same period last year. Second-quarter 2003 revenues from the TOOLS & HARDWARE segment increased 9 percent to $171.9 million from $157.9 million in the same period last year. This was driven by international shipments of power tools and assembly equipment. However, North American industrial, automotive and commercial
COOPER INDUSTRIES, LTD. PAGE 3 aircraft markets remained weak in the quarter. Currency translation increased second-quarter 2003 revenues by approximately 5 percent. Operating earnings for the segment in the 2003 second quarter were $7.0 million, compared with $4.0 million for the same period last year. Operating margins in the 2003 second quarter were 4.1 percent, compared with 2.5 percent for the 2002 second quarter. Revenues during the first half of 2003 in the Tools & Hardware segment were $325.5 million, compared with $313.4 million during the first six months of 2002. Operating earnings in the segment in the 2003 first half were $13.5 million, compared with $9.3 million for the first half of last year. "We made very solid progress during the second quarter in implementing our important programs to boost profitability, control costs and increase market share," said Riley. "Our Cooper Connection program continues to gain traction as many existing and new customers recognize the numerous benefits of our brand scope and our ongoing product innovations. The development of our Company-wide Enterprise Business System is under way. We expect to achieve significant productivity gains as we enhance transparency across our businesses and capture the benefits of our breadth and scale. We also are continuing our disciplined approach to cost management throughout all of our operations and are on target with our previously announced plans to appropriately size manufacturing capacity to marketplace demands. We expect to realize the increasing benefits from this activity as the year progresses. We continue to invest in these and other key programs that will generate significant operational improvements and enhance our global presence.
COOPER INDUSTRIES, LTD. PAGE 4 OUTLOOK "Despite the persistently negative economic environment, our sales have held up reasonably well year-to-date. Though we are encouraged that some economists are now predicting that the manufacturing sector of the nation's economy is about to begin a period of slow, steady improvement, we remain cautious about the near-term outlook for our markets. As a result, we estimate that third-quarter 2003 earnings will be in the range of $.73 to $.77 per share, and that 2003 annual earnings will be in the range of $2.80 to $2.85 per share. It should be noted that these projections do not include any income from the agreement related to the 1993 initial public offering of a subsidiary, which in 2002 contributed income of $.08 per share. Additionally, our projection for the year excludes the $.09 restructuring accrual reversal included in our second-quarter results."

EXHIBIT 99.2 Sales comparisons are presented to help investors understand the general tone of Cooper's business. These include the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, currency movements, etc. and are not necessarily indicative of business trends. Specific questions regarding sales trends should be directed to Richard Bajenski, Vice President, Investor Relations, bajenski@cooperindustries.com, (713) 209-8610. Sales for the three months ended on the date shown, compared to the same period in the prior year: OBSERVATIONS ON RECENT SALES TRENDS, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2003. COOPER INDUSTRIES Sales for the three months ended June 30, 2003, increased 1% compared with last year. ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS Sales for the three months ended June 30, 2003, declined less than 1% compared with last year. o Industrial markets worldwide have eased, impacting sales of hazardous duty electrical construction materials and circuit protection products. o Commercial construction markets remained weak, resulting in lower overall demand for light fixtures, wiring devices and electrical support structures. o Electronic and telecom market demand continued to be soft, leading to reduced sales of electronic components, circuit protection products and enclosures. o Sales of power equipment products were weak, reflecting domestic utilities' unwillingness to invest heavily in distribution system improvements due to ongoing weakness in end markets and their financial condition. o European sales of lighting fixtures and security products increased, primarily reflecting currency translation gains. Real demand for these products was down modestly for the period. o Product sales through the retail channel grew significantly. Expanded market coverage of "big box" chains and a healthy residential market propelled sales of lighting fixtures and wiring devices. o Translation effects increased revenues by approximately 2%. TOOLS AND HARDWARE Sales for the three months ended June 30, 2003, improved 9% compared with last year. o North American industrial, automotive and commercial aircraft end-markets remained weak, impacting sales of power tools and automated assembly equipment. Despite this, overall power tool sales were up significantly, reflecting strong international power tool and automated assembly equipment shipments. o Sales of hand tools were relatively flat compared to the prior period, reflecting stabilized markets, though at low levels. o Translation effects increased revenues by approximately 5%. Note: Includes impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, when applicable.
