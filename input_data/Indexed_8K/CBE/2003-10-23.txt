Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Third-Quarter Results of Operations On October 23, 2003, the Company issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the third quarter of 2003. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow and the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Company's capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Company's debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash balances to pay down debt.

EXHIBIT INDEX

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 23, 2003 Contact: John Breed Director, Media and Government Relations (713) 209-8835 COOPER INDUSTRIES ACHIEVES 12 PERCENT INCREASE IN THIRD-QUARTER NET INCOME Company reports per-share earnings of 75 cents HOUSTON, TX, October 23, 2003 - Cooper Industries, Ltd. (NYSE:CBE) today reported third-quarter net income rose 12 percent to $70.6 million, or $.75 per share (diluted), compared with net income of $63.2 million, or $.68 per share, for the third quarter of 2002. Revenues for the 2003 third quarter increased 5 percent to $1.05 billion, compared with $999.3 million for the same period last year. During the 2003 third quarter, as in the year's previous two quarters, the Company concluded that no income would be recognized from an agreement related to the 1993 initial public offering of a subsidiary. In the 2002 third quarter, pre-tax income from this agreement was approximately $3.0 million. The Company's effective tax rate for the 2003 third quarter was 20.0 percent, compared with 23.7 percent in the 2002 third quarter. "We are very encouraged by our third-quarter results," said H. John Riley, Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Revenues increased nicely, and we continued to achieve solid quarter-over-quarter margin improvement in our Electrical Products segment. "In addition, free cash flow for the third quarter was $121.5 million, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $211.6 million. Cooper's debt-to-total-capitalization ratio net of cash on September 30, 2003, was 32.0 percent, down from 35.4 percent at the end of the second quarter and 37.3 percent at the end of last year's third quarter. - more -
Cooper Industries, Ltd. Page 2 "Generating internal growth, improving productivity and maximizing cash flow continue to be key areas of focus for the Company, and we are beginning to see very beneficial results from these initiatives," continued Riley. "Our product development programs already are positively impacting revenues in our lighting, wiring device and hand tools businesses, and we anticipate additional product introductions in the coming months. In addition, our Cooper Connection distributor relationship program continues to further strengthen our position in the marketplace. These activities are broadening our customer base, enhancing our strong core businesses and expanding our already-extensive product offerings. "Additionally, our focus on low-cost manufacturing is resulting in progressive margin restoration. Our investments in global expansion and leading-edge business systems technology are positioning the Company for sustained market leadership in a highly competitive, challenging environment." Earnings per share for the first nine months of 2003 were $2.14, compared with $1.98 for the same period in 2002. Net income for the first nine months of 2003 was $199.6 million, compared with $185.9 million for the first nine months of last year. Included in the 2003 results is $8.6 million or $.09 per share, after tax, for the reversal of an accrual related to the Company's 2001 review of strategic alternatives. Year-to-date 2002 results included approximately $9.0 million in pre-tax income from the agreement related to the 1993 initial public offering of a subsidiary. Revenues for the first nine months of 2003 were $3.02 billion, compared with $2.98 billion for the same period in 2002. The Company's effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2003 was 20.0 percent, excluding the impact of the reversal of the accrual related to the Company's 2001 review of strategic alternatives. The Company's effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2002 was 23.7 percent. SEGMENT RESULTS Third-quarter 2003 revenues from the ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS segment rose 2 percent to $861.2 million, compared with $844.6 million for the same period last year. The effect of foreign exchange increased reported segment revenues by approximately 1 percent. - more -
Cooper Industries, Ltd. Page 3 Revenues improved in all the Company's Electrical Products businesses except the support systems business, which continues to be pressured by weak non-residential construction and telecommunications markets. Modest improvement in industrial and electronics activity positively impacted revenues in the hazardous-duty, circuit protection and wiring devices businesses. The Company's lighting business also benefited from an increase in orders from residential construction markets; however, this was somewhat offset by lower retail sales reflecting selected inventory adjustments throughout the channel. Revenues in the Company's power transmission and distribution equipment business were up modestly during the quarter, the result of increased international sales. Absent foreign exchange, the Company's European lighting and security business reported slightly lower revenues compared to the prior-year period. Third-quarter 2003 operating earnings in the Electrical Products segment were $115.2 million, compared with $104.8 million for the same period last year. Third-quarter 2003 segment operating margins were 13.4 percent, compared with 12.4 percent for the 2002 third quarter. Year-to-date 2003 revenues for the Electrical Products segment were $2.50 billion, compared with $2.51 billion for the same period in 2002. Operating earnings for the segment for the first nine months of 2003 were $324.7 million, compared with $304.5 million for the same period last year. Third-quarter 2003 revenues in the TOOLS & HARDWARE segment were $187.5 million, up 21 percent compared with $154.7 million for the third quarter 2002. Revenues of power tools were positively impacted by international shipments of large assembly equipment systems; however, demand in North American automotive and aerospace markets remained weak. Hand tool revenues increased, reflecting sales of recently introduced new products and improved sales to the retail channel. Currency translation increased third-quarter 2003 Tools & Hardware segment revenues by approximately 5 percent. Tools & Hardware segment operating earnings for the 2003 third quarter were $9.0 million, compared with $7.4 million for the same period last year. Operating margins in the segment were 4.8 percent in the 2003 third quarter, the same as 2002 third-quarter operating margins. Revenues during the first nine months of 2003 in the Tools & Hardware segment were $513.0 million, compared with $468.1 million during the first nine months of 2002. Operating earnings in the segment in the first nine months of 2003 were $22.5 million, compared with $16.7 million for the first nine months of last year. -more-
Cooper Industries, Ltd. Page 4 OUTLOOK "Despite uncertain market conditions, we anticipate generating fourth-quarter 2003 earnings in the range of $.75 to $.77 per share, significantly improved from the $.62 per share we earned in the fourth quarter of 2002, excluding the restructuring charge," said Riley. "While we expect to see the normal quarter-over-quarter decline in this year's fourth-quarter revenues, our internal growth and profitability improvement initiatives should allow us to continue to report improved results for this period. Furthermore, we now expect that our free cash flow will comfortably exceed $300 million for the year. More important, we expect to enter 2004 with continued positive momentum."
