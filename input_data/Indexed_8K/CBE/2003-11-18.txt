Cooper Industries, Ltd. Page 2 "Kirk's broad knowledge of the electrical products marketplace and his global experience will be extremely valuable to Cooper going forward," said H. John Riley, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "He has been instrumental in helping our Electrical Products businesses gain market traction and improve operational performance, ultimately strengthening our position as a global competitor in the electrical products industry. As chief operating officer, Kirk's vision and excellent strategic and operations management skills will result in further improvement in the competitive position of our world-class businesses, delivering state-of-the-art solutions and services to our customers." In a planned management succession, Jackson is retiring after 27 years of service to the Company. "Ralph Jackson became part of the Cooper organization when Cooper acquired McGraw-Edison in 1985.

"One cannot help but be excited about the Company's outlook," continued Riley.
