Sales for the three months ended on the date shown, compared to the same period in the prior year: OBSERVATIONS ON RECENT SALES TRENDS, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2003. COOPER INDUSTRIES Sales for the three months ended October 31, 2003, increased 4-6% compared with last year. ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS Sales for the three months ended October 31, 2003, increased 1-3% compared with last year. o Modest improvements in commercial and industrial activity positively impacted sales of hazardous duty electrical construction materials, lighting fixtures and wiring devices. o Electronics market demand improved for circuit protection components, while telecom market demand remained soft. o International sales of power systems products continued to improve, but domestic utilities remain reluctant to invest heavily in distribution system improvements. o European sales of many of our products increased as a result of modestly improved economic conditions and favorable currency translation gains. o Retail channel sales remain relatively consistent with the prior year's levels. TOOLS AND HARDWARE Sales for the three months ended October 31, 2003, improved 20-22% compared with last year. o Sales of hand tools improved, reflecting the continuing contribution from new product introductions, primarily in the retail channel. o Overall power tool sales were up significantly, reflecting strong automated assembly equipment and international hand held power tool shipments, offset somewhat by weak North American power tool demand. NOTE: INCLUDES IMPACTS OF TRANSLATION AND ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, WHEN APPLICABLE.
