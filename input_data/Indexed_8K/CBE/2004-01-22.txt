Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits. Exhibits 99.1 Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") press release dated January 22, 2004 titled "Cooper Industries Reports a 26 Percent Gain in Fourth-Quarter Earnings Per Share." Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Results of Operations for Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2003 On January 22, 2004, the Company issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the fourth quarter and full year 2003. The press release includes references to free cash flow; the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio; and operating earnings, operating margins and general corporate expense before restructuring and/or unusual items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Company's capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Company's debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash balances to pay down debt. Finally, management believes that the presentation of operating earnings, operating margins and general corporate expense before restructuring and/or unusual items provides investors with a useful measure to compare the Company's performance with performance in prior periods.

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 22, 2004 Contact: John Breed Director, Media and Government Relations (713) 209-8835 COOPER INDUSTRIES REPORTS A 26 PERCENT GAIN IN FOURTH-QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE Company achieves 6 percent revenue increase. HOUSTON, TX, January 22, 2004 - Cooper Industries, Ltd. (NYSE:CBE) today reported net income for the fourth quarter 2003 of $74.7 million, or $.78 per share (diluted). This compares with $27.8 million, or $.30 per share, for the 2002 fourth quarter, which included a $29.8 million, or $.32 per share, after-tax charge for restructuring costs. Fourth-quarter 2003 revenues were up 6 percent to $1.04 billion, compared with $985.0 million for the fourth quarter 2002. Operating earnings were $81.0 million in the 2003 fourth quarter, compared with $57.0 million for the same period in 2002. Before restructuring and unusual items, fourth-quarter operating earnings were $109.9 million in 2003, versus $96.1 million in 2002. The Company's effective tax rate for the 2003 fourth quarter was 20.0 percent, compared with 23.7 percent in the 2002 fourth quarter. As expected and previously disclosed, the Company received a tax refund of $75.9 million during the 2003 fourth quarter. This refund included $22.9 million, or $.24 per share, of after-tax interest income. During the quarter, the Company recorded certain after-tax restructuring charges of $13.6 million, or $.14 per share. The Company also made a $12.0 million discretionary contribution to the Cooper Industries Foundation during the quarter, resulting in a $9.6 million, or $.10 per share, after-tax charge for the period. Additionally, as in the year's previous three quarters, Cooper concluded that no - more -
COOPER INDUSTRIES PAGE 2 fourth-quarter 2003 income would be recognized from an agreement related to the 1993 initial public offering of a subsidiary. In the 2002 fourth quarter, pretax income from this agreement was approximately $3.0 million. Cooper's net income for 2003 was $274.3 million, or $2.92 per share, compared with $213.7 million, or $2.28 per share, for 2002. Annual 2003 revenues were $4.06 billion, compared with 2002 revenues of $3.96 billion. Annual 2003 operating earnings were $392.0 million, compared with $354.7 million for 2002. Included in the full-year 2003 results is an $8.6 million, or $.09 per share, after-tax gain from a 2003 second-quarter reversal of an accrual related to the Company's 2001 review of strategic alternatives. Full-year 2002 results included approximately $12.0 million in pretax income from the agreement related to the previously mentioned 1993 initial public offering of a subsidiary. Free cash flow for 2003 was $383.5 million. As a result, the Company's debt-to-total-capitalization ratio net of cash at December 31, 2003, was 28.2 percent, down significantly from 36.2 percent net of cash at December 31, 2002. "Cooper performed well in 2003," said H. John Riley, Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We made meaningful progress on our key growth, cash generation and profitability improvement initiatives. Additionally, despite difficult market conditions, our sales trends improved nicely as the year progressed, culminating in a 6 percent revenue increase in the fourth quarter. "Our financial condition is strong. We generated another year of exceptional free cash flow, and our balance sheet is in great shape. More important, we now are even better positioned to produce solid core growth and to expand our businesses through selective acquisitions. We have the right programs in place to continue to grow revenues, to further enhance profitability and to extend and enhance our business profile through global growth and new product development. "In a nutshell, we believe we're doing the right things, the right way," continued Riley. "Through highly disciplined management, we have continued to improve our financial fundamentals. And in the last half of 2003, we began to see signs that the growth and profitability programs we are executing are positively impacting our businesses, as we had planned. We are confident that this momentum will continue, providing increased value for our shareholders." - more -
COOPER INDUSTRIES PAGE 3 SEGMENT RESULTS Revenues from the ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS segment for the 2003 fourth quarter were $854.0 million, up 4.5 percent, compared with $817.5 million for the same period last year. The effect of foreign currency translation increased reported segment revenues by approximately 2 percent. Segment operating earnings for the fourth quarter 2003 were $94.0 million, compared with $72.1 million for the same period last year. Before restructuring charges, fourth-quarter segment operating earnings were $110.4 million in 2003, versus $96.1 million in 2002. Fourth-quarter operating margins were 12.9 percent in 2003, compared with 11.8 percent in 2002, also before restructuring charges. All of the Company's Electrical Products businesses grew revenues during the 2003 fourth quarter, except for the power transmission and distribution equipment business which continues to be challenged by weak utility markets. The balance of the Company's Electrical Products businesses achieved core revenue growth resulting from modest sequential economic improvement and the benefits of the Company's new product development and market penetration programs. Full-year 2003 revenues for the Electrical Products segment were $3.36 billion, compared with $3.32 billion in 2002. Operating earnings for 2003 were $418.7 million, compared with $376.6 million in 2002. Before restructuring charges, full-year operating earnings were $435.1 million in 2003, versus $400.6 million in 2002. Fourth-quarter 2003 revenues in the TOOLS & HARDWARE segment were $190.0 million, up 13 percent, compared with $167.5 million in the 2002 fourth quarter. Currency translation increased segment revenues for the quarter by approximately 6 percent. The power tools business continued to be positively impacted by strong shipments of large assembly equipment systems. Hand tools revenues strengthened, reflecting a pick up in retail channel activity and the impact of new products. Segment operating earnings for the 2003 fourth quarter were $16.9 million, compared with an operating loss of $2.1 million for the same period last year. Before restructuring charges, segment operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $16.5 million in 2003, versus $10.6 million in 2002. Fourth-quarter operating margins were 8.7 percent in 2003, compared with 6.3 percent in 2002, also before restructuring charges. Full-year 2003 Tools & Hardware revenues increased 11 percent to $703.0 million, compared with $635.6 million for the prior year. Annual operating earnings for the Tools & Hardware segment - more -
COOPER INDUSTRIES PAGE 4 increased in 2003 to $39.4 million, compared with $14.6 million in 2002. Before restructuring charges, full-year operating earnings were $39.0 million in 2003, versus $27.3 million in 2002. OUTLOOK "During the course of 2003, we made significant progress advancing important operating initiatives in both our Electrical Products and Tools & Hardware businesses," said Riley. "All of these programs are evolving nicely, and many already are contributing to our results. During the year, margins continued to improve in both business segments, driven by careful management of our overall cost structures. Our Strategic Sourcing initiative is now a key part of the fabric of our Company. Our investments in globalization and our Cooper Connection program are gaining momentum, allowing us to broaden our customer base. Other promising programs, like our new Enterprise Business System and our Manufacturing Productivity Improvement Program, are in the early stages of implementation. "As a result, we enter 2004 with confidence. We continue to see signs in our order book that an economic recovery is taking root. However, we recognize that some of these signs are fragile," said Riley. "Consequently, we are continuing to operate on the assumption that we will see only modest top line growth in 2004. Based on that outlook, we believe that 2004 earnings in the range of $3.15 to $3.30 per share are reasonable and achievable."
