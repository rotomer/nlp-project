Sales for the three months ended on the dates shown, compared to the same period in the prior year: OBSERVATIONS ON RECENT SALES TRENDS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2004. COOPER INDUSTRIES Sales for the three months ended January 31, 2004 increased 4-6% compared with last year reflecting modestly improved market conditions and translation benefits due to a weakening of the U.S. dollar. ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS Sales for the three months ended January 31, 2004 increased 3-5% compared with last year. o Continued strength in residential construction activity and modest improvements in industrial markets have led to increased sales of hazardous duty electrical construction materials, lighting fixtures and wiring devices. o A modest recovery in electronics markets has led to increased sales of circuit protection components. o While international sales of power systems products increased, domestic sales remain soft as utilities continue to defer investments in their distribution systems. o European sales of many Cooper products increased as a result of modestly improved economic conditions. TOOLS AND HARDWARE Sales for the three months ended January 31, 2004 improved 8-10% compared with last year. o Overall power tool sales were up, reflecting higher shipments of automated assembly equipment and improving power tool demand. o Sales of hand tools improved, reflecting new product introductions and better retail channel sales. NOTE: INCLUDES IMPACTS OF ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, WHEN APPLICABLE.
