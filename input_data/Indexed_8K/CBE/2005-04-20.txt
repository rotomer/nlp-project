Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
First-Quarter Results of Operations
On April 20, 2005, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the first quarter of 2005. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow and the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release.
Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Company's capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Company's debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash balances to pay down debt.

Exhibit 99.1
April 20, 2005
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
HOUSTON, TX, April 20, 2005  Cooper Industries, Ltd. (NYSE:CBE) today reported first-quarter earnings of $.92 per share (diluted), a 14 percent increase compared with $.81 per share for last year's first quarter. Revenues rose 7.5 percent in the 2005 first quarter to $1.14 billion, compared with $1.06 billion for the same period last year. Net income for the 2005 first quarter rose 13 percent to $87.8 million, compared with $77.7 million in the 2004 first quarter.
     "We are pleased that we are off to a very good start for 2005," said H. John Riley, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer. "We generated solid revenue growth and our margins continued to improve despite ongoing pressures related to raw materials, transportation and energy costs. Key internal initiatives to grow sales, improve productivity and enhance our global market position are producing expected results throughout the Company.
     "In addition, our solid first-quarter performance reflects the breadth and balance of the Company's products and markets served," continued Riley. "We expect that this, coupled with continued disciplined strategy execution, will deliver positive results over the balance of the year.
     "Cooper's balance sheet also remained very strong at quarter end. The Company's debt-to-total-capitalization ratio net of cash at March 31, 2005, was 25.9 percent, significantly better than 31.6 percent at the same time last year," said Riley.
 
     Cooper's segment reported first-quarter 2005 revenues of $968.3 million, compared with $890.7 million for last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of favorable currency translation, revenues grew approximately 8 percent in the first quarter. Segment operating earnings were $135.4 million, compared with $120.8 million for the same period last year. Segment operating margins improved to 14.0 percent in the 2005 first quarter, compared with 13.6 percent for the first quarter of 2004.
Electrical Products
     Solid overall demand in key North American residential, commercial and industrial markets positively impacted sales in each of the five electrical businesses that make up the Company's unique Cooper Connection product package. Additionally, continued investments in system upgrades by utilities resulted in revenue gains in Cooper's power transmission and distribution equipment business, while European lighting and security markets showed modest improvement. These positives were somewhat offset by reduced retail channel sales relative to very strong comparables in the 2004 first quarter.
     First-quarter 2005 revenues in the segment were $176.5 million, compared with $173.9 million in the same period last year. Excluding currency translation, segment revenues were flat. Segment operating earnings for the 2005 first quarter rose 25 percent to $14.7 million from $11.8 million in the prior year's first quarter. Return on sales for the segment in the quarter was 8.3 percent, up from 6.8 percent in the 2004 first quarter.
Tools & Hardware
     Tools & Hardware segment revenues were driven by improved hand tool demand in industrial markets, offset by lower hand tool retail sales when compared with last year's quarter and lower-than-anticipated demand for power tools from the industrial sector.
     "While we are mindful of the market and cost challenges that remain ahead, we continue to be optimistic regarding our ability to achieve meaningful improvement in 2005 earnings compared to our performance in 2004. As a result, we expect earnings for the second quarter of 2005 to be in the range of $.98 to $1.02 per share. Additionally, we see no reason to change our previously stated earnings range for the year of $3.94 to $4.12 per share," said Riley.
