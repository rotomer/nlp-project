Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Results of Operations for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2005
On January 24, 2006, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2005. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow and the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release.
Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Company's capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Company's debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash balances to pay down debt.

EXHIBIT 99.1
For Immediate Release
 Cooper Industries, Ltd. (NYSE: CBE) today reported fourth quarter 2005 earnings per share of $1.10 (diluted), an increase of 17 percent compared with $.94 earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2004. Fourth quarter 2005 revenues increased 3 percent to $1.19 billion, compared with $1.15 billion for the same period last year. For the fourth quarter of 2005, net income rose 17 percent to $104.0 million, compared with $88.9 million for the prior year's fourth quarter.
HOUSTON, Jan. 24, 2006
The fourth quarter of 2005 included approximately $.03 per share from a reduction in the effective tax rate to 21 percent for the year. The fourth quarter of 2005 also included a charge of approximately $.03 per share related to finalization of the exit liability for a multi-employer pension plan, and approximately $.03 per share in costs related to a previously announced management transition, and selling and administrative cost-reduction programs.
"We delivered a strong finish to an outstanding year, with good revenue growth, continued margin expansion and excellent cash flow in the fourth quarter," said President and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian. "Initiatives focused on joint-marketing programs, geographic expansion and overall productivity each contributed solid results, even in light of continued pressures in raw materials and energy costs. The business performed well overall."
 
Revenues for the full year of 2005 were $4.73 billion, a 6 percent increase compared with $4.46 billion in revenues for the full year 2004. Earnings per share were $4.12, compared with $3.58 for the same period in 2004, an increase of 15 percent. Net income for the full year of 2005 rose 15 percent to $391.1 million, compared with $339.8 million for the full year 2004.
"For the full year, organic growth contributed to a strong revenue performance, with solid earnings and margin expansion," said Hachigian. "In 2005, Cooper generated $490.4 million in free cash flow, the fifth consecutive year that free cash flow has exceeded net income. Cooper's debt-to-total-capitalization ratio net of cash at Dec. 31, 2005, was 19.0 percent."
Segment Results
segment revenues for the fourth quarter of 2005 increased approximately 4 percent to $991.1 million, compared with $950.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Currency translation reduced revenues in the quarter by approximately 1 percent. Segment operating earnings were $143.2 million, an increase of approximately 10 percent from $129.8 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2005 segment operating earnings included a $4.0 million charge related to finalization of the exit liability for a multi-employer pension plan on a facility closed during 2005. Segment operating margin improved to 14.4 percent for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with 13.7 percent in the same period last year.
Electrical Products
The increase in revenues for the Electrical Products segment reflects solid growth against a very strong fourth quarter in 2004. The improvement was driven by continued robust industrial demand and sustained activity in the commercial construction markets. Utility markets also remained healthy. Sales to the retail channel were off slightly against significantly strong sales comparables in the 2004 fourth quarter. Repair and reconstruction activity as a result of the U.S. Gulf Coast hurricanes also contributed to demand for the quarter.
The Electrical Products segment revenues for the full year of 2005 grew approximately 7 percent to $4.0 billion, compared with $3.7 billion for the full year of 2004. Operating earnings for the full year of 2005 were $585.0 million, approximately 14 percent above the $511.2 million recorded for the full year 2004.
 
segment revenues for the fourth quarter of 2005 were $194.9 million, compared with 2004 fourth quarter revenues of $198.4 million. Excluding currency translation, segment revenues were approximately 1 percent below the 2004 fourth-quarter level. Segment operating earnings were $20.7 million, compared with $20.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2004. Segment operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2005 was 10.6 percent, compared with 10.1 percent for the same period last year.
Tools
The decline in the Tools segment revenues reflects continued deferral of automated assembly systems projects from the automotive sector and weak demand for industrial power tools. Solid growth in hand tools from the industrial markets provided a partial offset.
Tools segment revenues for the full year of 2005 were $732.9 million, compared with $740.7 million for the full year of 2004. Operating earnings for the segment for the full year 2005 improved approximately 6 percent to $66.7 million, compared with $62.7 million for the full year of 2004.
Outlook
"With strong economic conditions worldwide, we are optimistic about our prospects for 2006," said Hachigian. "Industrial markets remain resilient, and there are indications that non-residential construction will again become a contributor to growth. We continue to see opportunities in international markets, particularly in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Although we expect residential markets may slow, the decline should be moderate.
"We have a strong management team, our initiatives have established a solid presence and strong momentum, and we are generating significant free cash flow. For 2006, we expect earnings per share to increase 12 to 15 percent, with revenue gains in the range of 4 to 6 percent. We are on-track to deliver continued solid results and to accelerate the pace of our growth," he concluded.
Discontinued Operations: Pneumo-Abex Proposed Settlement Agreement
On Dec. 19, 2005, Cooper Industries announced that the Company and other parties involved in the resolution of the Federal-Mogul Corporation bankruptcy proceeding had reached an
 
agreement regarding Cooper's participation in Federal-Mogul's 524 (g) asbestos claimants' trust. A critical term of the proposed settlement was the issuance of a stay for all pending Abex asbestos claims. At a hearing on Jan. 20, 2006, other parties to the bankruptcy proceedings were unable to satisfy the court's requirements to grant the required stay. As a result, the proposed settlement agreement will require renegotiation of certain terms.
At this time, the exact manner in which this issue will be resolved is not known. As additional information becomes available, Cooper may adjust the accompanying Income Statement for the quarter and year ending Dec. 31, 2005, to include a Charge to Discontinued Operations and related adjustments to the Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash Flows, prior to the filing of the Company's Form 10-K report for the year ended Dec. 31, 2005.
