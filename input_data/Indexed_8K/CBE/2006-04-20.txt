Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
First Quarter Results of Operations On April 20, 2006, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the first quarter of 2006. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow and the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Company's capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to access the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provid es investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Company's debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt.

First quarter 2006 revenues increased 8 percent to $1.24 billion, compared with $1.14 billion for the same period last year.

HOUSTON, April 20, 2006
"Our business continues to deliver excellent results, driven by a strengthening global economy and solid demand in the core industrial, utility and commercial construction markets," said Cooper Industries Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian. "We continue to execute well on the initiatives focused on marketing programs, new products, global expansion and productivity, which contribute to organic growth, increased margins and strong cash flow."
segment revenues for the first quarter of 2006 increased approximately 10 percent to $1.06 billion, compared with $968.3 million in the first quarter of 2005. Segment operating earnings were $160.1 million, an increase of approximately 18 percent from $135.4 million in the prior year's first quarter. Segment operating margin improved 110 basis points to 15.1 percent for the first quarter of 2006.
Segment Results
Electrical Products
The significant, year-over-year increase in revenues for the Electrical Products segment reflects strong organic growth. The favorable impact from recent acquisitions offset the impact of unfavorable currency translation. The improvement in revenues was driven by continued robust demand from industrial and utility markets, while activity in construction markets has remained steady. Sales through the retail channel improved as major retailers began restocking shelves following fourth quarter inventory adjustments.
During the first quarter, the Company completed the acquisitions of Wheelock, Inc. and G&H Technologies, with combined annualized revenue of approximately $75 million. Wheelock provides a strategic extension to the Company's European portfolio with products designed for the U.S. market, including electronic strobe horns, mini-horns, speakers and emergency evacuation systems. G&H Technologies provides Cooper with advanced, highly technical specification-grade technologies for hazardous environments, including the military and heavy-duty industrial sectors.
segment revenues for the first quarter of 2006 increased approximately 2 percent to $180.3 million, compared with 2005 first quarter revenues of $176.5 million. Currency translation reduced revenues approximately 1 percent in the quarter. Segment operating earnings were $17.3 million, an increase of approximately 18 percent, compared with $14.7 million for the first quarter of 2005. Segment operating margin for the first quarter of 2006 improved 130 basis points to 9.6 percent, compared with 8.3 percent for the same period last year.
Tools
The improvement in Tools segment revenues was driven by solid demand for hand tools, partially offset by lower shipments of assembly equipment.
"Global economic conditions and the performance of our businesses in the first quarter cause us to be increasingly optimistic about our full-year 2006 performance," said Hachigian. "Demand in the industrial markets is providing significant opportunities, and the utilities sector and global energy infrastructure continue to exhibit momentum. Our initiatives have enabled us to deliver record earnings, despite continued cost pressures from commodities and energy.
Outlook
"In this light, we now expect 2006 revenues to increase in the range of 7 to 9 percent, with earnings per share between $4.75 and $4.90, an increase of $ .15 per share from the Company's previous outlook. This represents a 15 to 19 percent increase, compared with full-year results for 2005. Second quarter 2006 revenue increases are expected to be in the range of 7 to 9 percent, with earnings per share of $1.17 to $1.23."
