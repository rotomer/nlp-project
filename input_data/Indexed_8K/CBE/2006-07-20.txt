Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On July 6, 2006, Cooper Industries and other parties involved in the resolution of the Federal-Mogul Corporation bankruptcy proceeding reached a revised agreement regarding Coopers participation in Federal-Moguls 524(g) asbestos claimants trust. On July 7, 2006, Cooper Industries filed a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing the key terms and conditions of the agreement including the identity of the parties to the agreement. Attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 is a copy Term Sheet that sets forth the detailed terms and conditions.
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Second Quarter Results of Operations On July 20, 2006, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the second quarter of 2006. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow and the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Company's capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provi des investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Company's debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt.

entirety such that the parties will be returned to their respective positions as if the Plan A Effective Date had never occurred and Plan B will be implemented; and
(iii) to provide adequate assurance that the amount payable to Cooper under Plan B set forth in Section 7(a) will be available in the event Plan A is unwound as provided in clause (ii) above as well as the source of funds for such payment.
The parties hereto will also make appropriate provision in the Plan so that the debtors in the Reorganization Cases, with the consent of the ACC and the FCR, can cause the Plan to go effective even though the order (A) confirming the Plan, and any portion of the Plan involving Plan A, or (B) issuing the Pneumo Protected Party Injunction, is not a final, non-appealable order. Subject to the rights of any other insureds (other than rights, if any, of holders of Pneumo Asbestos Claims), the Plan shall also provide that Cooper (or Pneumo Abex, with Cooper's consent) may designate, subject to court approval (which approval may be set forth in the confirmation order for the Plan), insurers that agree to pay money to resolve claims for coverage of Pneumo Asbestos Claims as entities entitled to receive protection under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code pursuant to the Plan.

If the Trust assumes only the Pneumo Asbestos Claims and no other asbestos liabilities under the Plan (and therefore the Plan provides that more than one trust will be established under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code), a segregated subfund will not be required and, notwithstanding any other provision herein, the term "Pneumo Abex Subfund" when used herein shall be deemed to refer to the Trust. The Pneumo Abex Subfund will be funded as described in Section 3 of this Term Sheet.
Assumption of Pneumo Asbestos Claims by the Trust:

Cooper will execute settlement agreements relating to the Subject Policies that are consistent with this Section 9 and that do not impose any obligations on Cooper other than a release by Cooper of its rights to products/completed operations coverage, as requested by FMP and upon FMP's written confirmation that the related 12% payment (in the case of Plan A) or 20% payment (in the case of Plan B), respectively, will be made to Cooper. Nothing herein, nor any agreement by FMP, shall affect the coverages available under the Subject Policies, except for the products and completed operations aggregate limits.

If payments are made at the 12% sharing level and thereafter the Plan B Date occurs, then Cooper shall receive, on the Plan B Date, a supplemental payment with respect to all payments made at the 12% sharing level such that Cooper shall receive the remaining 8% of such payments it would have received had the 20% sharing level been in place at the time any such payments were made prior to the Plan B Date.

 Cooper Industries, Ltd. (NYSE: CBE) today reported second quarter 2006 earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.27 (diluted), an increase of 25 percent compared with $1.02 earnings per share for the second quarter of 2005. Second quarter 2006 revenues increased 8 percent to $1.29 billion, compared with $1.19 billion for the same period last year. Income from continuing operations rose 23 percent to $119.8 million, compared with the prior year amount of $97.3 million.
HOUSTON, July 20, 2006
"With a second consecutive record quarter, our businesses continue to deliver excellent results, powered by strong core demand in key served markets, including industrial, utility and commercial construction, plus a growing global economy," said Cooper Industries Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian. "This quarter is again characterized by good execution on customer-focused initiatives, including marketing programs, new product introductions, continued global expansion and increased productivity and service, all of which contribute to organic growth, increased margins and strong cash flow."
As previously announced, the Company and other parties involved in the resolution of the Federal-Mogul Corporation ("FMC") bankruptcy proceedings reached a revised agreement regarding Cooper's participation in FMC's 524(g) asbestos claimants' trust. In light of the revised agreement, the Company recognized an after-tax discontinued operations charge in the 2006 second quarter of $20.3 million, or $.21 per diluted share. Inclusive of the charge, net income for the second quarter of 2006 was $99.5 million, or $1.06 per share, compared with $97.3 million, or $1.02 per share, for the prior year's second quarter.
"Cooper's financial position remains very strong. The Company's debt-to-total capitalization ratio, net of cash at June 30, 2006, was 22.6 percent, compared with 24.0 percent at the same time last year," said Hachigian.
Revenues for the first six months of 2006 were $2.53 billion, an 8 percent increase from the $2.33 billion in revenues for the first six months of 2005.

"While recent political events and higher interest rates are a concern, the worldwide economic environment remains strong, and our business performance remains on track, which provides us with cautious optimism for the remainder of 2006," said Hachigian. "The global energy infrastructure continues to grow, with solid demand from utilities and the industrial sector, and improving nonresidential construction offsetting slower residential construction. While commodity pricing and energy continue to drive cost pressures, our initiatives provide the foundation for the Company to deliver record earnings.
Outlook
"We now expect 2006 revenues to increase in the range of 7 to 9 percent, with earnings per share from continuing operations between $4.90 and $5.05, an increase of $ .15 per share from the Company's previous outlook. This represents a 19 to 23 percent increase, compared with full-year results for 2005. Third quarter 2006 revenue increases are expected to be in the range of 7 to 9 percent, with earnings per share of $1.28 to $1.35."
