Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Third Quarter Results of Operations On October 24, 2006, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Companys results of operations for the third quarter of 2006. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow and the Companys net debt-to-total capitalization ratio. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financials measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Companys capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Companys operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-tot al capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Companys debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt.

HOUSTON, October 24, 2006
"Our businesses continue to deliver excellent results, powered by continued strong demand in the key industrial, utility and nonresidential construction end-markets," said Cooper Industries Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian. "The third quarter is again characterized by solid execution and progress on our strategic initiatives, including Cooper Connection, Globalization, Strategic Sourcing, Enterprise Business Systems and Productivity, all of which contribute to organic growth, increased margins and strong cash flow."
"Cooper's financial position remains very strong, even after several acquisitions and the repurchase of more than 3 million shares year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with a debt-to-total capitalization ratio, net of cash, of 24.6 percent which gives us the flexibility to continue investing in our business, and paying a competitive dividend, while also pursuing further strategic acquisitions," said Hachigian.
Revenues for the first nine months of 2006 were $3.84 billion, an 8 percent increase from the $3.54 billion in revenues for the first nine months of 2005. Earnings per share from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2006 were $3.78, compared with $3.02 for the same period in 2005, an increase of 25 percent. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2006 rose 24 percent to $355.7 million, compared with $287.1 million for the first nine months of last year.
segment revenues for the third quarter of 2006 increased 10 percent to $1.13 billion, compared with $1.03 billion in the third quarter of 2005.

Recent acquisitions contributed approximately 2 percent to the year-over-year growth. Segment operating earnings were $186.4 million, an increase of 18 percent from $158.2 million in the prior year's third quarter. Segment operating margin improved 110 basis points to 16.5 percent for the third quarter of 2006.
Segment Results
Electrical Products
The increase in revenues for the Electrical Products segment was driven by continued strong growth in industrial and utility markets, and improved activity in nonresidential construction markets, partially offset by reduced sales through the retail channel.
Electrical Products segment revenues for the first nine months of 2006 grew 9 percent to $3.29 billion, compared with $3.01 billion in 2005. Segment operating earnings for the first nine months increased 19 percent to $524.0 million compared with $441.8 million for the same period last year.
segment revenues for the third quarter of 2006 increased 2 percent to $187.2 million, compared with 2005 third quarter revenues of $182.9 million. Currency translation increased revenues approximately 1 percent in the quarter. Segment operating earnings for the period were $24.3 million, compared with $15.5 million for the third quarter of 2005. Segment operating margin for the third quarter of 2006 improved to 13.0 percent, compared with 8.5 percent for the same period last year.
Tools
Revenues for the first nine months of 2006 increased 3 percent to $551.8 million, compared with $538.0 million for the same period last year. Segment operating earnings for the first nine months of 2006 grew 33 percent to $61.2 million, compared with $46.0 million in the prior-year period.
"Our outlook remains positive for the remainder of 2006, driven by the strength in our diversified portfolio of businesses and products, our ability to consistently execute upon our strategic initiatives and a continued favorable global economic outlook," said Hachigian. "We expect to continue to see solid demand from the utility and industrial sectors, and improvement in nonresidential construction markets.
Outlook
"We continue to be committed to deliver a balance of revenue growth, margin expansion and cash generation. We expect 2006 revenues to increase in the range of 8 to 9 percent, with earnings per share from continuing operations between $5.04 and $5.10, an increase from our previous outlook of $4.90 to $5.05 for the full year. Fourth quarter 2006 revenue increases are expected to be in the range of 8 to 10 percent, with earnings per share of $1.26 to $1.32."
