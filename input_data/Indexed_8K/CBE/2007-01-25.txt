Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Results of Operations for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2006 On January 25, 2007, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow and the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Company's capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Company's debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt.

 Cooper Industries, Ltd. (NYSE: CBE) today reported fourth quarter 2006 earnings per share of $1.38 (diluted), an increase of 25 percent compared with $1.10 continuing earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2005. Fourth quarter 2006 revenues increased 13 percent to $1.34 billion, compared with $1.19 billion for the same period last year. For the fourth quarter of 2006, income from continuing operations was $128.6 million, compared with $104.0 million for the prior year's fourth quarter. Earnings in the fourth quarter benefited from the December 9, 2006 extension of R&D Income Tax Credit, which positively impacted results by approximately $0.03 per share.
HOUSTON, January 25, 2007
"We delivered a very strong finish to an outstanding year," said Cooper Industries Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian. "Execution of our top-line growth and productivity strategies again drove solid revenue growth, strong margin performance and excellent cash flow in the fourth quarter."
Revenues for the full year 2006 were $5.18 billion, a 10 percent increase compared with $4.73 billion in revenues for the full year 2005. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $5.16, compared with $4.12 for the same period in 2005, an increase of 25 percent. Income from continuing operations for the full year 2006 rose 24 percent to $484.3 million, compared with $391.1 million for the full year 2005.
"For the full year, both organic growth and our acquisition program contributed to a strong revenue performance, with solid earnings and margin expansion," said Hachigian. "In 2006, Cooper generated $535.0 million in free cash flow, the sixth consecutive year that free cash flow has exceeded income from continuing operations. Our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio net of cash at December 31, 2006, was 19.1 percent and Cooper is now in the strongest financial position of our history."
Segment Results
segment revenues for the fourth quarter of 2006 increased 14 percent to $1.13 billion, compared with $991.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Currency translation increased revenues in the quarter by approximately 1 percent. Recent acquisitions contributed approximately 3 percent to the year-over-year growth. Segment operating earnings were $179.2 million, an increase of 25 percent from $143.2 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Segment operating margin improved to 15.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with 14.4 percent in the same period last year.
Electrical Products
The increase in revenues for the Electrical Products segment was driven by strong shipments in the utility market, solid activity in industrial, and improving nonresidential construction markets. As anticipated, residential market activity was soft.
The Electrical Products segment revenues for the full year 2006 grew 11 percent to $4.43 billion, compared with $4.0 billion for the full year 2005. Operating earnings for the full year 2006 were $703.2 million, 20 percent above the $585.0 million recorded for the full year 2005.
segment revenues for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $206.8 million, compared with 2005 fourth quarter revenues of $194.9 million, an increase of 6 percent. Currency translation increased revenues approximately 2 percent in the quarter. Segment operating earnings were $24.4 million, compared with $20.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2005. Segment operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2006 was 11.8 percent, compared with 10.6 percent for the same period last year.
Tools

"We are optimistic about Cooper's prospects for 2007," said Hachigian. "We have a diversified portfolio of businesses and have demonstrated the ability to execute upon our strategic initiatives. We see a continued favorable global economic outlook, augmented by our disciplined acquisition program.
Outlook
"We have a strong management team in place and we remain committed to delivering a balance of growth, margin expansion and cash generation. For 2007, we expect earnings per share to increase 12 to 15 percent, with revenue gains in the range of 7 to 10 percent."
