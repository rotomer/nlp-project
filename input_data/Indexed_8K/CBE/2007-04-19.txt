Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
First Quarter Results of Operations On April 19, 2007, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the first quarter of 2007. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow and the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Company's capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provid es investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Company's debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt.

HOUSTON, April 19, 2007
"Strong utility demand and solid demand in the core industrial and nonresidential construction markets contributed to our performance in the quarter. Continued execution on international growth programs and ongoing benefits from company-wide strategic initiatives drove our results as well," said Cooper Industries Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian. "Core revenue growth was supplemented by our acquisitions program, which contributed over 3 percent in addition to currency translation, which contributed almost 2 percent."
segment revenues for the first quarter of 2007 increased 14 percent to $1.21 billion, compared with $1.06 billion in the first quarter of 2006. Currency translation increased revenues by approximately 1 percent and acquisitions contributed approximately 4 percent to the year-over-year growth. Segment operating earnings were $193.5 million, an increase of approximately 21 percent from $160.1 million in the prior year's first quarter. Segment operating margin improved 90 basis points to 16.0 percent for the first quarter of 2007.
Segment Results
Electrical Products
The increase in revenues for the Electrical Products segment reflects continued strength in the utility markets, strong international growth and solid growth in core U.S. industrial and nonresidential construction markets, as well as incremental sales related to the April go-live of a division on our enterprise business system. As anticipated, softness in U.S. residential markets partially offset the segment's overall revenue growth.
Year to date, the Company has completed three acquisitions, with combined annualized revenue of approximately $100 million. WPI provides highly customized specification-grade connector technologies for use in harsh, heavy-duty and hazardous locations in military, industrial and commercial applications. Cybectec provides products and software systems that meet utilities' most demanding real-time and reliability requirements in a number of areas, including electrical power substation automation, integration, communication and instrumentation. Polaron provides intelligent lighting control solutions for use in office, hospitality, educational and urban outdoors settings that allow customers to realize energy savings, creative ambiance, or enhanced productivity, safety and security.
segment revenues for the first quarter of 2007 increased 2 percent to $183.4 million, compared with 2006 first quarter revenues of $180.3 million. Excluding the effects of currency translation, revenues were flat in the quarter. Solid aerospace and industrial sales were offset by soft residential and motor vehicle markets. Segment operating earnings were $21.8 million, an increase of approximately 26 percent, compared with $17.3 million for the first quarter of 2006. Segment operating margin for the first quarter of 2007 improved 230 basis points to 11.9 percent, compared with 9.6 percent for the same period last year.

"The performance of our businesses and global economic conditions in the first quarter cause us to remain optimistic about our full-year 2007 performance," said Hachigian. "Our initiatives focused on customer loyalty, innovation, globalization, talent development and operational excellence will continue to contribute to our efforts to deliver a balance of growth, margin expansion and cash generation. We now expect 2007 revenues to increase in the range of 10 to 13 percent, with earnings per share between $2.95 and $3.08. This represents a 14 to 19 percent increase, compared with full-year results for 2006. Second quarter 2007 revenue increases are expected to be in the range of 12 to 14 percent, with earnings per share of $.72 to $.76."
