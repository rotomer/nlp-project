The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent the indemnified party is entitled to the benefits of indemnification pursuant to Section 8(a) or (b) hereof, as applicable, by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement , unless the indemnifying party is, in good faith, contesting the amount of such reimbursement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Settlements
     Section 9. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Guarantors, and the total underwriting discount received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company and the
Contribution
 
Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any reasonable legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
     The Company, the Guarantors and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule A. For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer or employee of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company or a Guarantor, each officer of the Company or a Guarantor, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or a Guarantor with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company or such Guarantor.
     Section 10. . If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the several Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities, which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such Securities set forth opposite their respective names on Schedule A bears to the aggregate principal amount of such Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase such Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase such Securities and the aggregate principal amount of such Securities with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of
Default of One or More of the Several Underwriters
 
Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
     As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10. Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
     Section 11. . Prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to the Company and the Guarantors if at any time after the Execution Time (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company's or any Guarantor's securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or the New York Stock Exchange, or trading in securities generally on either the Nasdaq Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or materially limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on any of such stock exchanges by the Commission or the NASD; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by any of federal or New York authorities; (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity involving the United States, or any change in the United States or international financial markets, as in the judgment of the Representatives is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities in the manner and on the terms described in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities; or (iv) there shall have occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services. Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Sections 4 and 6 hereof, and provided further that Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.
Termination of this Agreement
     Section 12. . The Company and the Guarantors acknowledge and agree that: (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, and the Company and the Guarantors are capable of evaluating and understanding and understand and accept the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the financial advisor, agent or fiduciary of the Company, the Guarantors or their respective affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other affiliated party of the Company or the Guarantors; (iii) no Underwriter has assumed or will assume an advisory, agency or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company or any of the Guarantors with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby
No Fiduciary Duty
 
or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company or any of the Guarantors on other matters) and no Underwriter has any obligation to the Company or any of the Guarantors with respect to the offering contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Underwriters and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and the Guarantors and that the several Underwriters have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any advisory, agency or fiduciary relationship; and (v) the Underwriters have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby and the Company and the Guarantors have consulted their own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate.
     This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Guarantors and the several Underwriters with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Company and the Guarantors hereby waive and release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company or any of the Guarantors may have against the several Underwriters with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty with respect to the offering contemplated hereby.
     Section 13. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Guarantors, their respective officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement (i) will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any (A) investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, the officers or employees of any Underwriter, or any person controlling the Underwriter, the Company, any Guarantor, the officers or employees of the Company or any of the Guarantors, or any person controlling the Company or any of the Guarantors, as the case may be or (B) acceptance of the Securities and payment for them hereunder and (ii) will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities sold hereunder. In addition, the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall survive termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect.

          (vi) The Guarantees of the Notes by the Subsidiary Guarantors have been duly authorized by each of the Subsidiary Guarantors and, assuming the Parent has the necessary corporate right, power and authority to execute and deliver, and perform its obligations under, the Indenture, the Guarantees constitute, under the laws of the State of New York, valid and legally binding obligations of each of the Guarantors enforceable against the Guarantors in accordance with their terms.

          (ix) The statements in each of the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the caption "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations" insofar as they refer to statements of U.S. law or legal conclusions fairly summarize, in all material respects, the information described therein.
          (x) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any court or arbitrator or governmental or regulatory authority is required to be obtained or made by the Company or any of the Guarantors under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, or New York state or U.S. federal law for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company and the Guarantors of the Underwriting Agreement, the Notes, the Guarantees or the Indenture, the issuance and sale of the Notes and the Guarantees and compliance by the Company and the Guarantors with the terms of such agreements, except for (i) such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders and registrations or qualifications as may be required under applicable state securities or blue sky laws, as to which we express no opinion, and (ii) such others as have been obtained or taken and are in full force and effect.
          (xi) Neither the Company nor any of the Guarantors is, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Notes and the related Guarantees and the application of the related proceeds as described in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus none of them will be, an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.

          (xiv) The Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus (other than (i) the financial statements and the notes thereto, financial statement schedules and other financial information contained or incorporated by reference therein, as to which we express no opinion, and (ii) that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee) appear on their face to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the respective rules thereunder.
     We have participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the Company and the Guarantors, and representatives of the independent public accountants for Parent and representatives of the Underwriters and their counsel at which conferences we made
 
inquiries of such officers, representatives and accountants and discussed the contents of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, and related matters. We did not participate in the preparation of, or review prior to filing, the documents filed with the Commission that are incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus. Although we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, except as set forth in paragraphs (vii), (viii) and (ix) above, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts have come to our attention that lead us to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, at each time of effectiveness contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) the Prospectus, as of its date or at the Closing Date, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) the Disclosure Package, as of the Initial Sale Time, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except that we express no view as to (i) financial statements including the notes thereto, financial statement schedules and other financial information contained or incorporated by reference therein or (ii) that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust Indenture Act of the Trustee).
 
     (i) The Company has been duly organized and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of Bermuda and has the corporate power and authority necessary to own or hold properties other than real property in Bermuda and to conduct the business which the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus describe it to be engaged in.
     (ii) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under the Subject Agreements to which it is a party and to take all action as may be necessary to complete the transactions contemplated thereby.
     (iii) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Subject Agreements to which it is a party and the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorised by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company.
     (iv) The Subject Agreements have been duly executed by the Company and each constitutes legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
     (v) No consent, licence or authorisation of, filing with, or other act by or in respect of, any governmental authority or court of Bermuda is required to be obtained by the Company in connection with the guarantee by the Company of the Notes and the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of the Subject Agreements or to ensure the legality, validity, admissibility into evidence or enforceability as to the Company, of the Subject Agreements.
     (vi) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Subject Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not violate, conflict with or constitute a default under (i) any requirement of any law or any regulation of Bermuda or (ii) the Constitutional Documents, and the Subject Agreements will not of themselves create a charge or lien over the assets of the Company.
     (vii) The statements in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus under the heading "Enforcement of Judgments and Service of Process" and "Certain Tax ConsequencesBermuda Taxation" insofar as they purport to describe the provisions of the laws of Bermuda referred to therein, are accurate and correct in all material respects.
     (viii) It is not necessary or desirable to ensure the enforceability in Bermuda of the Subject Agreements that they be registered in any register kept by, or filed with, any governmental authority or regulatory body in Bermuda. Although the Subject Agreements will not create a charge over the assets of the Company, it should be noted that charges over the assets of Bermuda companies (other than real property in Bermuda or a ship or aircraft registered in Bermuda) wherever situated, and charges on assets
 
situated in Bermuda (other than real property in Bermuda or a ship or aircraft registered in Bermuda) which are granted by or to companies incorporated outside Bermuda, are capable of being registered in Bermuda in the office of the Registrar of Companies pursuant to the provisions of Part V of the Companies Act 1981 (the "Act"). Registration under the Act is the only method of registration of charges over the assets of Bermuda companies in Bermuda except charges over real property in Bermuda or ships or aircraft registered in Bermuda. Registration under the Act is not compulsory and does not affect the validity or enforceability of a charge and there is no time limit within which registration of a charge must be effected. However, in the event that questions of priority fall to be determined by reference to Bermuda law, any charge registered pursuant to the Act will take priority over any other charge which is registered subsequently in regard to the same assets, and over all other charges created over such assets after 1 July, 1983, which are not registered.
     (ix) The Company has received an assurance from the Ministry of Finance granting an exemption, until 28 March 2016, from the imposition of tax under any applicable Bermuda law computed on profits or income or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, provided that such exemption shall not prevent the application of any such tax or duty to such persons as are ordinarily resident in Bermuda and shall not prevent the application of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of the Land Tax Act 1967 or otherwise payable in relation to land in Bermuda leased to the Company. There are, subject as otherwise provided in this opinion, no Bermuda taxes, stamp or documentary taxes, duties or similar charges now due, or which could in the future become due, in connection with the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of the Subject Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby, or in connection with the admissibility in evidence thereof and the Company is not required by any Bermuda law or regulation to make any deductions or withholdings in Bermuda from any payment it may make thereunder.
     (x) The choice of the laws of the State of New York as the proper law to govern the Subject Agreements is a valid choice of law under Bermuda law and such choice of law would be recognised, upheld and applied by the courts of Bermuda as the proper law of the Subject Agreements in proceedings brought before them in relation to the Subject Agreements, provided that (i) the point is specifically pleaded; (ii) such choice of law is valid and binding under the laws of the State of New York; and (iii) recognition would not be contrary to public policy as that term is understood under Bermuda law.
     (xi) The submission by the Company to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York pursuant to the Subject Agreements is not contrary to Bermuda law and would be recognised by the courts of Bermuda as a legal, valid and binding submission to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, if such submission is accepted by such courts and is legal, valid and binding under the laws of the State of New York.
 
     (xii) A final and conclusive judgment of a foreign court against the Company based upon the Subject Agreements (other than a court of jurisdiction to which The Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1958 applies, and it does not apply to the courts of the State of New York) under which a sum of money is payable (not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature, in respect of a fine or other penalty, or in respect of multiple damages as defined in The Protection of Trading Interests Act 1981) may be the subject of enforcement proceedings in the Supreme Court of Bermuda under the common law doctrine of obligation by action on the debt evidenced by the foreign court's judgment. A final opinion as to the availability of this remedy should be sought when the facts surrounding the foreign court's judgment are known, but, on general principles, we would expect such proceedings to be successful provided that:
     (A) the court which gave the judgment was competent to hear the action in accordance with private international law principles as applied in Bermuda; and
     (B) the judgment is not contrary to public policy in Bermuda, has not been obtained by fraud or in proceedings contrary to natural justice and is not based on an error in Bermuda law.
     Enforcement of such a judgment against assets in Bermuda may involve the conversion of the judgment debt into Bermuda dollars, but the Bermuda Monetary Authority has indicated that its present policy is to give the consents necessary to enable recovery in the currency of the obligation.
     (xiii) The appointment by the Company of Cooper US, Inc. as agent for the receipt of any service of process in respect of any court in the State of New York in connection with any matter arising out of or in connection with the Indenture is a valid and effective appointment, if such appointment is valid and binding under the laws of the State of New York and if no other procedural requirements are necessary in order to validate such appointment.
     (xiv) Based solely upon the Company Search and the Litigation Search:

If and so long as the Trustee in good faith so determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders, the Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest). The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, the principal of, or premium, if any, on, the Notes. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture.
     12. . The Trustee, in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from, and perform services for the Issuer or its affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Issuer or its affiliates, as if it were not the Trustee.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
     We have acted as special United States counsel to Cooper Industries, Ltd., a Bermuda company ("Cooper Parent") and Cooper US, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Cooper US"), in connection with the proposed offering by Cooper US of $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Cooper US's 6.10% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Notes") to be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Cooper Parent, Cooper B-Line, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Cooper Bussmann, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Cooper Crouse-Hinds, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Cooper Lighting, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Cooper Power Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Cooper Wiring Devices, Inc., a New York corporation (collectively, the "Subsidiary Guarantors" and with Cooper Parent, the "Guarantors") pursuant to guarantees (the "Guarantees"). The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an Indenture dated June 18, 2007, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture (as so amended and supplemented, the "Indenture") among Cooper Parent, Cooper US, the subsidiary guarantors named therein and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, which establishes the forms and terms of the Notes pursuant to the Indenture. We refer to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-143688) (the "Registration Statement"), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") by Cooper US and the Guarantors on June 13, 2007, including the base prospectus contained therein, and the prospectus supplement (the "Prospectus Supplement") filed with the Commission on June 14, 2007, relating to the offering of the Notes.
     We have examined such corporate records, documents and questions of law as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion. In such examinations, we have  
 
assumed the genuineness of signatures and the conformity to the originals of the documents supplied to us as copies. As to various questions of fact material to this opinion, we have relied upon statements and certificates of officers and representatives. Without limiting the foregoing, we have examined the Underwriting Agreement, dated June 13, 2007, among Cooper Parent, Cooper US, the subsidiary guarantors named therein, Banc of America Securities LLC, Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and the other underwriters(the "Underwriters") named therein (the "Underwriting Agreement"). In connection with rendering the opinions set forth below, we have assumed that the indenture and any supplemental indenture relating to the Securities will be duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto and each person signing the Indenture will have the legal capacity and authority to do so.
     Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the limitations, qualifications, assumptions and exceptions stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
     (i) The Notes have been duly authorized and, when executed and authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will, under the laws of the State of New York, constitute legal and binding obligations of Cooper US; and
     (ii) Assuming the Company has the necessary corporate right, power and authority to execute and deliver, and perform its obligations under, the Indenture, the Guarantees will, under the laws of the State of New York, constitute legal and binding obligations of each of the Guarantors.
     Each of the opinions above is subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and to general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).
     The foregoing opinions are limited to the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (including the applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and the reported judicial decisions interpreting these laws) and the federal laws of the United States of America.
     We hereby consent to the references to this firm under the caption "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement and to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement. By giving such consent, we do not admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933 or the rules and regulations thereunder.
Very truly yours,
