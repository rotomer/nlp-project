Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Second Quarter Results of Operations On July 19, 2007, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the second quarter of 2007. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow; the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio; and income from continuing operations and earnings per share for the second quarter and first six months of 2007, excluding income tax adjustments. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Company's capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a crit eria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Company's debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt. Finally, Company management believes that discussing income from continuing operations and earnings per share for the second quarter and first six months of 2007, excluding income tax adjustments, provides investors with a more meaningful assessment of operating results for 2007 and the comparison to operating results for the comparable periods in 2006.

Exhibit 99.1
For Immediate Release
 Cooper Industries, Ltd. (NYSE: CBE) today reported second quarter 2007 earnings per share (excluding income tax adjustments) of $.78 (diluted), an increase of 22 percent, compared with $.64 earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2006. Second quarter 2007 revenues increased 14 percent to $1.46 billion, compared with $1.29 billion for the same period last year. Income from continuing operations (excluding income tax adjustments) rose 22 percent to $145.7 million, compared with the prior year amount of $119.8 million.
HOUSTON, July 19, 2007
"Growth in developing markets and continued strong utility and industrial demand contributed to our performance in the quarter. Continued execution on company-wide strategic initiatives drove our results as well," said Cooper Industries Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian. "Acquisitions contributed 4 percent to revenue growth, the highest level in over five years, and currency translation contributed almost 2 percent."
The 2007 second quarter includes a $63.5 million or $.34 earnings per share reduction of income taxes expense. As anticipated and previously disclosed, the Internal Revenue Service and Cooper finalized settlements related to the 2000 through 2004 tax years in the second quarter. Previously unrecognized tax benefits of $55.7 million were therefore recognized in the quarter. A change in rates for the Texas margin tax and other developments in the 2007 second quarter represented the remaining $7.8 million of income taxes expense reduction.
In the 2006 second quarter, the Company recognized an after-tax discontinued operations charge of $20.3 million, or $.11 per diluted share. Inclusive of the charge, net income for the second quarter of 2006 was $99.5 million, or $.53 per share.
"Cooper's financial position remains very strong. During the quarter, we successfully issued $300 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes, with an effective annual cost to Cooper of 5.75 percent and used the proceeds to repay $300 million of senior notes that matured in July. The Company's debt-to-total capitalization ratio, net of cash at June 30, 2007, was 19.7 percent," said Hachigian.
Revenues for the first six months of 2007 were $2.86 billion, a 13 percent increase from the $2.53 billion in revenues for the first six months of 2006. Earnings per share from continuing operations (excluding income tax adjustments) for the first six months of 2007 were $1.49, compared with $1.21 for the same period in 2006, an increase of 23 percent. Income from continuing operations (excluding income tax adjustments) for the first six months of 2007 rose 22 percent to $277.6 million, compared with $227.5 million for the first six months of last year.
segment revenues for the second quarter of 2007 increased 15 percent to $1.27 billion, compared with $1.10 billion in the second quarter of 2006. Recent acquisitions contributed over 4 percent to the year-over-year growth with favorable currency translation contributing less than 2 percent. Segment operating earnings were $213.9 million, an increase of 21 percent from $177.5 million in the prior year's second quarter. Segment operating margin improved 70 basis points to 16.8 percent for the second quarter of 2007.
Segment Results
Electrical Products
The increase in revenues for the Electrical Products segment reflects continued strength in the utility and industrial markets, strong international growth and solid growth in U.S. nonresidential construction markets. As anticipated, the U.S. residential markets continued to be soft.
In May, the Company acquired MadahCom, Inc., a privately-owned manufacturer of secure wireless emergency control and Mass Notification Systems. With 2006 revenues of approximately $22 million of hardware, software and installation services, MadahCom currently has more than 200 installations worldwide at military, government, commercial sites, industrial locations and other campus environments.
Electrical Products segment revenues for the first half of 2007 grew 15 percent to $2.48 billion, compared with $2.16 billion in 2006. Segment operating earnings for the first six months increased 21 percent to $407.4 million, compared with $337.6 million for the same period last year.
segment revenues for the second quarter of 2007 increased 4 percent to $191.4 million, compared with 2006 second quarter revenues of $184.3 million. Currency translation increased revenues approximately 3 percent in the quarter. Segment operating earnings for the period were $21.6 million, an increase of 10 percent, compared with $19.6 million for the second quarter of 2006. Segment operating margin for the second quarter of 2007 improved 70 basis points to 11.3 percent, compared with 10.6 percent for the same period last year. The increase in revenues in the Tools segment reflects solid aerospace demand and increased penetration in retail channels offset by weakness in the motor vehicle markets.
Tools
Revenues for the first six months of 2007 increased 3 percent to $374.8 million, compared with $364.6 million for the same period last year. Segment operating earnings for the first half of 2007 grew 18 percent to $43.4 million, compared with $36.9 million in the prior-year period.
"The performance of our businesses in the quarter, continued strength in the majority of our end-markets, and global economic conditions cause us to remain optimistic about our full-year 2007 performance," said Hachigian. "Our initiatives focused on customer loyalty, innovation, globalization, talent development and operational excellence will continue to contribute to our efforts to deliver a balance of growth, margin expansion and cash generation. We expect our Electrical Products segment to continue to perform strongly in the third quarter and for the year. Our Tools segment has a tough comparable in the third quarter where last year segment earnings sequentially increased 24 percent from the second to third quarter. We are forecasting that third quarter 2007 Tools segment earnings will increase over the 2007 second quarter, but decline compared to the third quarter of 2006 as the business continues its planned shift to higher margin tightening technology products and ships existing low margin assembly equipment.
Outlook
For the Company, we expect 2007 revenues to increase in the range of 10 to 13 percent, with earnings per share from continuing operations between $3.07 and $3.12 (excluding income tax adjustments). This represents a 19 to 21 percent increase, compared with full-year results for 2006. Third quarter 2007 revenue increases are expected to be in the range of 11 to 12 percent, with earnings per share of $.78 to $.82."
