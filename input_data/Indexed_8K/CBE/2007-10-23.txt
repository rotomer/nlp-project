Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Third Quarter Results of Operations On October 23, 2007, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the third quarter of 2007. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow; the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio; and income from continuing operations and earnings per share for the third quarter and first nine months of 2007, excluding income from tax adjustments for the first nine months of 2007, and excluding income from payments received from Belden under a tax sharing agreement and expense related to certain legal matters for the third quarter of 2007. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Company's capacity in the per iod to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Company's debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt. Finally, Company management believes that adjusting income from continuing operations and earnings per share for the third quarter and first nine months of 2007 to exclude income from tax adjustments, the Belden income and expense related to certain legal matters, provides investors with a more meaningful assessment of operating results for 2007 and the comparison to operating results for the comparable periods in 2006.

Third quarter 2007 revenues increased 14 percent to $1.50 billion, compared with $1.31 billion for the same period last year.

HOUSTON, October 23, 2007
"Our global growth investments continued to gain momentum with developing markets revenues growing close to 40 percent in the quarter. Our Company-wide strategic initiatives and proven business model have now delivered seven quarters in a row of 20 percent plus earnings per share growth from continuing operations," said Cooper Industries Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian. "Core growth was 9 percent, with acquisitions contributing 3 percent to revenue growth, and currency translation contributing 2 percent."
"Cooper's financial position continues to be strong. We ended the third quarter with a debt-to-total capitalization ratio, net of cash, of 20.9 percent, even after several acquisitions and the repurchase of over 5 million shares year-to-date," said Hachigian.
For the 2007 third quarter, Cooper recognized $23.5 million in income under an agreement with Belden. In 1993, Cooper completed an initial public offering of the stock of Belden, formerly a division of Cooper. Under the agreement, Belden and Cooper made an election that increased the tax basis of certain Belden assets. Belden is required to pay Cooper ninety percent of the amount by which Belden has actually reduced tax payments that would otherwise have been payable if the increase in the tax basis of assets had not occurred, as realized principally over fifteen years. In addition to the Belden income, Cooper recognized $6.4 million of expense related to certain legal matters.
Revenues for the first nine months of 2007 were $4.36 billion, a 13 percent increase from the $3.84 billion in revenues for the first nine months of 2006. Earnings per share from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2007 (excluding income tax accrual adjustments, Belden income and legal matters) were $2.31, compared with $1.89 for the same period in 2006, an increase of 22 percent. Income from continuing operations (excluding income tax accrual adjustments, Belden income and legal matters) for the first nine months of 2007 rose 21 percent to $430.1 million, compared with $355.7 million for the first nine months of 2006.
The 2007 year-to-date results include a $63.5 million or $.34 earnings per share reduction of income taxes expense. The Internal Revenue Service and Cooper finalized settlements totaling $55.7 million related to the 2000 through 2004 tax years in the second quarter. A change in rates for the Texas margin tax and other developments in the 2007 second quarter represented the remaining $7.8 million of income taxes expense reduction. The 2006 year-to-date results include an after-tax discontinued operations charge of $20.3 million, or $.11 per diluted share.
segment revenues for the third quarter of 2007 increased 15 percent to $1.30 billion, compared with $1.13 billion in the third quarter of 2006. Recent acquisitions and favorable currency translation increased revenues approximately 5 percent compared to prior year. Segment operating earnings were $224.2 million, an increase of 20 percent from $186.4 million in the prior year's third quarter. Segment operating margin improved 70 basis points to 17.2 percent for the third quarter of 2007.
Segment Results
Electrical Products
The increase in revenues for the Electrical Products segment continued to reflect strength in the utility and industrial markets, strong international growth and solid growth in U.S. nonresidential construction markets. As anticipated, the U.S. residential markets continued to be soft.
In August, the Company acquired Illinois-based io Lighting, a dedicated light-emitting diode lighting fixture company, and Vermont-based Powerline Communications, Inc., a manufacturer of digital lighting control panels. Expected sales for the two companies in 2007 are approximately $17 million and the combined purchase price was $22 million.
In October, the Company announced a joint venture with the Nature Science and Technology Company, a privately-held medium voltage indoor switchgear manufacturer based in Zhejiang province, China. The joint venture, 60 percent controlled by Cooper, will allow Cooper access to indoor switchgear products that meet International Electrotechnical Commission standards, expanding upon its current offerings that meet American National Standards Institute electrical standards.
Electrical Products segment revenues for the first nine months of 2007 grew 15 percent to $3.78 billion, compared with $3.29 billion in 2006. Segment operating earnings for the first nine months increased 21 percent to $631.6 million compared with $524.0 million for the same period last year.
segment revenues for the third quarter of 2007 increased 7 percent to $199.4 million, compared with 2006 third quarter revenues of $187.2 million. Currency translation increased revenues over 3 percent in the quarter. Segment operating earnings for the period were $22.0 million, compared with $24.3 million for the third quarter of 2006. Segment operating margin for the third quarter of 2007 was 11.0 percent, compared with 13.0 percent for the same period last year. The assembly systems business is transitioning from complete assembly systems to fastening stations and smaller installations. The 2007 third quarter earnings and return on revenues were impacted by shipments of low-margin assembly systems. The increase in revenues in the Tools segment reflects solid aerospace demand, increased penetration in retail channels and the shipment of assembly systems, offset by weakness in the motor vehicle markets.
Tools
Revenues for the first nine months of 2007 increased 4 percent to $574.2 million, compared with $551.8 million for the same period last year. Segment operating earnings for the first nine months of 2007 grew 7 percent to $65.4 million, compared with $61.2 million in the prior-year period.
"The performance of our businesses in the quarter, continued strength in the majority of our end-markets, and global economic conditions cause us to remain optimistic about our full-year 2007 performance," said Hachigian. "Our initiatives focused on customer loyalty, innovation, globalization, talent development and operational excellence will continue to contribute to our efforts to deliver a balance of growth, margin expansion and cash generation. We expect our Electrical Products and Tools segments to continue to perform strongly in the fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter revenues to increase in the range of 12 to 14 percent, with earnings per share from continuing operations between $.79 and $.83.
Outlook
For the year, we expect 2007 revenues to increase in the range of 12 to 14 percent, with earnings per share from continuing operations between $3.11 and $3.15 (excluding income tax accrual adjustments, Belden income and legal matters). This represents a 21 to 22 percent increase, compared with full-year results for 2006.
