Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2007 Results of Operations On January 24, 2008, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2007. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow; the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio; and income from continuing operations and earnings per share for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2007, excluding income from tax adjustments and excluding income from payments received from Belden under a tax sharing agreement and expense related to certain legal matters for the fourth quarter of 2007. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Company's capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Company's debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt. Finally, Company management believes that adjusting income from continuing operations and earnings per share for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2007 to exclude income from tax adjustments, the Belden income and expense related to certain legal matters, provides investors with a more meaningful assessment of operating results for 2007 and the comparison to operating results for the comparable periods in 2006.

For Immediate Release
 Cooper Industries, Ltd. (NYSE: CBE) today reported fourth quarter 2007 earnings per share of $.83 (diluted), an increase of 22 percent compared with $.68 earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2006 (excluding unusual items). Fourth quarter 2007 revenues increased 15 percent to $1.54 billion, compared with $1.34 billion for the same period last year. For the fourth quarter of 2007, net income (excluding income tax adjustments and Belden income) was $152.7 million, compared with $126.1 million for the prior year's fourth quarter.
HOUSTON, January 24, 2008
"We delivered a strong finish to another outstanding year," said Cooper Industries Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian. "Our investments in global growth continued to perform with developing markets revenues growing almost 40 percent in the quarter. Core growth was 8 percent, with acquisitions contributing over 4 percent to revenue growth, and currency translation contributing almost 3 percent."
Revenues for the full year 2007 were $5.90 billion, a 14 percent increase compared with $5.18 billion in revenues for the full year 2006. Earnings per share from continuing operations (excluding income tax adjustments, Belden income and legal matters) were $3.14, compared with $2.58 for the same period in 2006, an increase of 22 percent. Income from continuing operations (excluding unusual items) for the full year 2007 rose 20 percent to $582.8 million, compared with $484.3 million for the full year 2006.
"In 2007, Cooper generated $681.6 million in free cash flow, the seventh consecutive year that free cash flow has exceeded income from continuing operations (excluding income tax adjustments)," said Hachigian. "Our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio net of cash at December 31, 2007, was 24.8 percent, even after spending $626.2 million for acquisitions (including cash restricted under a tender offer for an acquisition) and repurchasing almost 7 million shares during 2007."
For the 2007 fourth quarter, Cooper recognized $6.3 million in income under an agreement with Belden compared with $5.1 million for the 2006 fourth quarter. In 1993, Cooper completed an initial public offering of the stock of Belden, formerly a division of Cooper. Under the agreement, Belden and Cooper made an election that increased the tax basis of certain Belden assets. Belden is required to pay Cooper ninety percent of the amount by which Belden has actually reduced tax payments that would otherwise have been payable if the increase in the tax basis of assets had not occurred, as realized principally over fifteen years. For the 2007 full year, total income recognized under the Belden agreement was $33.1 million compared with $5.1 million for 2006. In addition to the Belden income, Cooper recognized $8.8 million of expense for the 2007 full year related to legal matters on previously disposed-of businesses, compared with $4.8 million in 2006.
The 2007 fourth quarter includes a $20.3 million or $.11 earnings per share reduction of income taxes expense, due to expiration of the statute of limitations regarding certain potential tax exposure matters, changes to state and international valuation allowances and tax benefits of international reorganizations. A $63.5 million or $.34 earnings per share reduction of income taxes expense was also recorded in the 2007 second quarter. The Internal Revenue Service and Cooper finalized settlements totaling $55.7 million related to the 2000 through 2004 tax years in the second quarter. A change in rates for the Texas margin tax and other developments in the 2007 second quarter represented the remaining $7.8 million of income taxes expense reduction. Total 2007 reduction of income taxes expense for these matters was therefore $83.8 million or $.45 earnings per share.
The fourth quarter 2006 benefited from the December 9, 2006 extension of R&D Income Tax Credit, which positively impacted results by approximately $0.01 per share. Full year 2006 results include an after-tax discontinued operations charge of $20.3 million, or $.11 per diluted share.
segment revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 16.7 percent to $1.32 billion, compared with $1.13 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006. Core growth was 9.4 percent, with acquisitions contributing approximately 4.8 percent to year-over-year revenue growth, and currency translation contributing approximately 2.5 percent. Segment operating earnings were $216.6 million, an increase of 21 percent from $179.2 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Segment operating margin improved to 16.4 percent for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with 15.8 percent in the same period last year.
Segment Results
Electrical Products
The increase in revenues for the Electrical Products segment continued to reflect solid growth in the utility and industrial markets, strong international growth and solid growth in U.S. nonresidential construction markets. As anticipated, the U.S. residential markets continued to be soft.
In December, Cooper announced six acquisitions:
Combined full year 2007 sales for these acquired companies was approximately $122 million and total combined purchase price was approximately $152 million.
Also in December, Cooper announced that it had made a binding offer for all outstanding shares of MTL Instruments Group plc ("MTL"), a publicly-traded company based in the United Kingdom. MTL is a world leader in the development and supply of electronic instrumentation and protection equipment, the majority of which is used in hazardous environments such as the petrochemical, chemicals and oil and gas production industries. In 2006, MTL had revenues of 85.3 million and net income of 5.5 million. The offer has been approved by greater than 90 percent of MTL's shareholders and is pending final regulatory approval.
The Electrical Products segment revenues for the full year 2007 grew 15 percent to $5.11 billion, compared with $4.43 billion for the full year 2006. Operating earnings for the full year 2007 were $848.2 million, 21 percent above the $703.2 million recorded for the full year 2006.
segment revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $220.5 million, compared with 2006 fourth quarter revenues of $206.8 million, an increase of 6.6 percent. Currency translation increased revenues approximately 5.2 percent in the quarter. Segment operating earnings were $28.6 million, compared with $24.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. Segment operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 13.0 percent, compared with 11.8 percent for the same period last year. The increase in revenues in the Tools segment reflects solid aerospace demand and increased penetration in retail channels, offset by weakness in the motor vehicle markets.
Tools
Tools segment revenues for the full year 2007 were $794.7 million, compared with $758.6 million for the full year 2006, up 5 percent. Operating earnings for the segment for the full year 2007 were $94.0 million, compared with $85.6 million for the full year 2006.
"We have a diversified portfolio of businesses and have demonstrated the ability to execute upon our strategic initiatives," said Hachigian. "While there is considerable economic uncertainty in the U.S., we see continued opportunities from our investments in developing markets, as well as the energy and utility infrastructure markets."
Outlook
"Our strong balance sheet provides us with outstanding flexibility as we enter 2008. We have a strong management team in place and we remain committed to delivering a balance of growth, margin expansion and cash generation. For 2008, we expect earnings per share (excluding income tax accrual adjustments, Belden income and legal matters) to increase 10 to 15 percent, with revenue gains in the range of 10 to 13 percent (including the MTL acquisition). For the first quarter of 2008, inclusive of acquisition integration costs and reorganization costs in the Tools segment, we expect earnings per share to increase 10 to 15 percent with revenue gains in the range of 11 to 14 percent."
