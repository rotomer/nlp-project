Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
First Quarter Results of Operations On April 24, 2008, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the first quarter 2008. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow; the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio; and income from continuing operations and earnings per share for the first quarter 2008, excluding gains from currency related and discrete tax items for the first quarter of 2008. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Company's capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and inc ludes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Company's debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt. Finally, Company management believes that adjusting income from continuing operations and earnings per share for the first quarter 2008 to exclude income from gains from currency related and discrete tax items, provides investors with a more meaningful assessment of operating results for 2008 and the comparison to operating results for the comparable periods in 2007.

HOUSTON, April 24, 2008
"Cooper had a very strong start to 2008. Our significant exposure to the energy and global project infrastructure markets, as well as increasing investment in faster growing, higher-margin platforms allowed us to deliver solid top-line growth and double-digit earnings growth. Despite the loss of a large distribution center from a tornado and restructuring costs in our Cooper Tools business, we delivered 14 percent recurring EPS growth. Core revenue growth was supplemented by acquisitions, which contributed slightly more than 6 percent, as well as currency translation, which contributed almost 3 percent," said Cooper Industries Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian.
The 2008 first quarter includes gains from currency related and income tax items totaling $8.3 million, or $.05 earnings per share.
During the first quarter of 2008, the Company purchased 6.3 million shares of common stock for $266.4 million and issued $300 million of seven-year senior unsecured notes at a 5.56 percent effective interest rate. As of March 31, 2008, the company's debt net of cash and investments to total capitalization was 31.0 percent compared to 24.8 percent at December 31, 2007. "We continue to forecast free cash flow to exceed recurring income for the eighth year in a row. Our consistent ability to deliver strong free cash flow and our strong balance sheet enabled us the opportunity to take advantage of our weak stock price in the first quarter," said Hachigian.
segment revenues for the first quarter of 2008 increased 12 percent to $1.36 billion, compared with $1.21 billion in the first quarter 2007. Acquisitions increased revenues by approximately 7 percent and currency translation contributed approximately 2 percent to the year-over-year growth. Segment operating earnings were $223.5 million, an increase of approximately 16 percent from $193.5 million in the prior year's first quarter. Segment operating margin improved 40 basis points to 16.4 percent for the first quarter of 2008.
Segment Results
Electrical Products
"We delivered a very strong 2008 first quarter against an outstanding prior year, where core revenues increased 9 percent," said Hachigian.
The increase in revenues for the Electrical Products segment reflects continued strength in the industrial and energy markets, with international market initiatives providing further growth for the first quarter of 2008. The continued softness in the U.S. residential markets partially offset the segment's overall revenue growth. Revenues and earnings were also impacted by the loss of a large distribution center from a tornado.
During the first quarter of 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of MTL Instruments Group plc ("MTL"), a publicly traded company (LSE: MTI) based in the United Kingdom. The total purchase price, including assumed debt, was approximately $332 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, MTL reported consolidated revenues of approximately $190 million.
segment revenues for the first quarter of 2008 were $184.5 million, up slightly from 2007 first quarter revenues of $183.4 million. Excluding the effects of currency translation, revenues for the quarter were approximately 5 percent lower than 2007 first quarter on declining retail revenue and weaker North America industrial demand. International industrial demand provided some offset to the lower North America revenue results for the quarter. Segment operating earnings were $17.2 million, down from the first quarter 2007 levels of $21.8 million. Segment operating margin for the first quarter 2008 was 9.3 percent compared to 11.9 percent for the comparable prior year period. The first quarter 2008 results include approximately $1.0 million in restructuring costs.
Tools
"While there continues to be considerable uncertainty in the U.S. economy, we have a diversified portfolio and have demonstrated the ability to execute upon our strategic initiatives," said Hachigian. "We are encouraged by our order levels during the first quarter as they exceeded revenues in 7 of our 8 business units. We continue to see opportunities from our investments in developing markets, as well as the energy and utility infrastructure markets. We are confident of our ability to provide growth and leverage from our recent acquisition activities as we move through the remainder of 2008."
Outlook
"We have a strong management team in place and we remain committed to delivering a balance of growth, margin expansion and cash generation. For 2008, we are now forecasting earnings per share to increase 12 to 16 percent to $3.51 to $3.65, inclusive of the first quarter gains from currency and discrete tax items of $.05 per share as well as the expected second quarter acquisition integration and reorganization costs of $.02 to $.03 per share, with revenue gains in the range of 10 to 13 percent. For the second quarter of 2008, inclusive of expected acquisition integration and reorganization costs in the Tools segment, we expect earnings per share to increase 10 to 15 percent with revenue gains in the range of 12 to 15 percent."
