Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Second Quarter Results of Operations On July 24, 2008, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the second quarter 2008. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow; the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio; and net income and earnings per share for the second quarter 2008, excluding losses from severance costs and currency related items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Company's capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determini ng incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Company's debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt. Finally, Company management believes that adjusting net income and earnings per share for the second quarter 2008 to exclude losses from severance costs and currency related items, provides investors with a more meaningful assessment of operating results for 2008 and the comparison to operating results for the comparable periods in 2007.

HOUSTON, July 24, 2008
"In the second quarter, we built on our very solid start to 2008. We delivered strong growth in developing markets as well as in our energy, utility and industrial businesses. Core revenue growth of 7 percent was supplemented by acquisitions, which contributed nearly 8 percent, as well as almost 3 percent from currency translation," said Cooper Industries Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian.
The 2008 second quarter includes severance costs associated with the downsizing of a Tools Segment international facility and currency related charges totaling $9.2 million after-tax, or $.05 earnings per share.
As of June 30, 2008, the company's debt net of cash and investments to total capitalization was 28.0 percent compared to 24.8 percent at December 31, 2007. "We continue to forecast free cash flow to exceed recurring income for the eighth year in a row. Our consistent ability to deliver strong free cash flow and our strong balance sheet enable us to invest in growth as well as return capital to our shareholders," said Hachigian.
Revenues for the first six months of 2008 were $3.27 billion, a 14 percent increase from the $2.86 billion in revenues for the first six months of 2007. For the first six months of 2008, net income excluding unusual items rose 14% to $316.2 million, compared with $277.0 million for the prior year's first six months excluding unusual items. Earnings per share excluding unusual items for comparable periods were $1.78 or up 19%, compared with prior year's $1.49.
segment revenues for the second quarter of 2008 increased 19 percent to $1.51 billion, compared with $1.27 billion in the second quarter 2007. Core revenues increased by over 7 percent with acquisitions contributing close to 9 percent and currency translation contributing over 2 percent to the year-over-year growth. Segment operating earnings were $259.0 million, an increase of approximately 21 percent from $213.9 million in the prior year's second quarter. Segment operating margin improved 40 basis points to 17.2 percent for the second quarter of 2008.
Segment Results
Electrical Products
"The strong Electrical core revenue growth followed an outstanding second quarter in 2007, where core revenues increased 9 percent. Electrical margins matched our best quarterly performance in over five years," said Hachigian.
The increase in revenues for the Electrical Products segment reflects continued strength in the industrial, utility and energy markets, with international market initiatives providing further growth for the second quarter of 2008. The continued softness in the U.S. residential markets partially offset the segment's overall revenue growth.
segment revenues for the second quarter of 2008 were $214.3 million, up 12 percent from 2007 second quarter revenues of $191.4 million. Excluding the effects of currency translation, revenues for the quarter were approximately 6 percent higher than 2007 second quarter on improved industrial demand and relatively flat retail results. Segment operating earnings were $22.3 million (excluding pre-tax severance costs of $7.6 million), up from the second quarter 2007 levels of $21.6 million. Segment operating margin for the second quarter 2008 excluding the severance costs was 10.4 percent compared to 11.3 percent for the comparable prior year period.
Tools
Revenues for the first six months of 2008 increased 6 percent to $398.8 million, compared with $374.8 million for the same period last year. Segment operating earnings for the first half of 2008 declined to $39.5 million excluding severance related costs, compared to $43.4 million in the prior-year period.
"I am proud that our Cooper Team continues to deliver in these more uncertain times. We have a diversified portfolio and have demonstrated the ability to execute upon our strategic initiatives," said Hachigian. "Cooper has steadily invested over the years in long-term growth and productivity initiatives; customer loyalty, innovation, globalization, talent development and operational excellence. As a result, we continue to be optimistic regarding our sustainable growth strategy. Despite the more challenging economic outlook in certain markets, we are confident in our ability to drive growth and operating leverage in our business as we move through the remainder of 2008."
Outlook
"We have a strong management team in place and we remain committed to delivering a balance of growth, margin expansion and cash generation. For 2008, we are now forecasting earnings per share to increase 15 to 18 percent to $3.61 to $3.71, excluding $.59 for unusual items in the prior year, with revenue growth in the range of 12 to 14 percent. For the third quarter of 2008, we expect earnings per share to increase to $.92 to $.97 with revenue growth in the range of 12 to 15 percent."
