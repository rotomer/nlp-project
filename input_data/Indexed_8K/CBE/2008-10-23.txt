Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Third Quarter Results of Operations On October 23, 2008, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the third quarter 2008. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow; the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio; and net income and earnings per share for the third quarter 2008, excluding gains from discrete tax items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Company's capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Company's debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt. Finally, Company management believes that adjusting net income and earnings per share for the third quarter 2008 to exclude gains from discrete tax items, provides investors with a more meaningful assessment of operating results for 2008 and the comparison to operating results for the comparable periods in 2007.

For Immediate Release
 Cooper Industries, Ltd. (NYSE: CBE) today reported third quarter 2008 earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.08 (diluted), compared with $.93 for the third quarter of 2007. Excluding discrete tax items, the third quarter 2008 earnings per share from continuing operations of $.97, including a favorable impact of a lower effective tax rate substantially offset by a pension plan curtailment, is 17 percent higher than prior year results of $.83 (excluding Belden income and legal matters). Third quarter 2008 revenues increased 15 percent to $1.73 billion, compared with $1.50 billion for the same period last year. For the third quarter of 2008, income from continuing operations excluding unusual items rose 12 percent to $170.9 million, compared with $153.1 million for the prior year's third quarter.
HOUSTON, October 23, 2008
"In the third quarter, we delivered strong core revenue growth of 7 percent supplemented by acquisitions, which contributed over 7 percent, as well as approximately 1 percent from currency translation. We are very pleased with our performance in light of the unprecedented market volatility that occurred late in the third quarter," said Cooper Industries' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian.
As of September 30, 2008, the company's debt net of cash and investments, which totaled only $944.1 million, to total capitalization was 24.3 percent compared to 24.8 percent at December 31, 2007. "We continue to forecast free cash flow to exceed recurring income for the eighth year in a row. Cooper's consistent ability to deliver strong free cash flow and our conservative capital structure enable us to maintain a disciplined strategy of investing in growth, as well as returning capital to our shareholders throughout this period of volatile credit markets," said Hachigian.
Revenues for the first nine months of 2008 were $5.0 billion, a 15 percent increase from the $4.36 billion in revenues for the first nine months of 2007. For the first nine months of 2008, income from continuing operations excluding unusual items rose 13 percent to $487.1 million, compared with $430.1 million for the prior year's first nine months. Earnings per share from continuing operations excluding unusual items were $2.75 or up 19 percent, compared with prior year's $2.31.
As was previously announced on October 1, 2008, Cooper will not participate in the Federal Mogul Corporation Asbestos Trust and is instead proceeding under Plan B. Therefore, the Federal Mogul bankruptcy estate paid Cooper $141 million in early October. Cooper's financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities related to the on-going activities under Plan B. As a result of these adjustments, the Company recognized an after-tax discontinued operations income of $16.6 million or $.09 per share in the third quarter of 2008.
segment revenues for the third quarter of 2008 increased 17 percent to $1.53 billion, compared with $1.30 billion in the third quarter 2007. Core revenues increased by over 8 percent with acquisitions contributing over 8 percent and currency translation contributing nearly 1 percent to the year-over-year growth. Segment operating earnings were $249.7 million, an increase of approximately 11 percent from $224.2 million in the prior year's third quarter. Segment operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 16.4 percent for the third quarter of 2008, compared to the third quarter of 2007.
Segment Results
Electrical Products
"The strong Electrical core revenue growth followed an outstanding third quarter in 2007, where core revenues increased 10 percent. Electrical margins pulled back from the second quarter levels which matched our best quarterly performance in over five years to 16.4 percent as a result of product mix, material price inflation and inventory production reductions," said Hachigian.
The increase in revenues for the Electrical Products segment reflects strength in the industrial, utility and energy markets, with international market initiatives providing further growth for the third quarter of 2008. The continued softness in the U.S. residential markets and slowing in selected European markets partially offset the segment's overall revenue growth.
segment revenues for the third quarter of 2008 were $201.7 million, up 1 percent from 2007 third quarter revenues of $199.4 million. Excluding the effects of currency translation, revenues for the quarter were approximately 3 percent lower than 2007 third quarter on declining North American aerospace, retail and automotive results and weaker European demand, partially offset by increased revenue in Asia and the rest of the world. Segment operating earnings were $24.1 million, up 10 percent from the third quarter 2007 levels of $22.0 million. Segment operating margin for the third quarter 2008 was 11.9 percent compared to 11.0 percent for the comparable prior year period.

Revenues for the first nine months of 2008 increased 5 percent to $600.5 million, compared with $574.2 million for the same period last year. Segment operating earnings for the nine months of 2008 declined to $63.6 million excluding severance related costs, compared to $65.4 million in the prior-year period.
"I am proud that our Cooper Team continues to deliver in these uncertain times. We have a diversified portfolio and have demonstrated the ability to execute upon our strategic initiatives," said Hachigian.
Outlook
"The freezing of credit markets on top of the already slowing U.S. and European economies will impact demand for our products and services over the next six months and possibly longer. We have a strong management team in place, a strong balance sheet and outstanding cash flow that will enable us to weather the anticipated difficult economy ahead. In the fourth quarter we anticipate our customers reducing inventory levels and our manufacturing facilities to likewise operate at a lower level of production. While currently it is difficult to forecast the length and depth of a downturn, we are proactively implementing contingency plans that will reduce our cost structure, and expect to take a charge of $20 million to $22 million in severance expenses in the fourth quarter to reduce our workforce by over 1,000 employees and will also be taking charges for product line moves and other restructuring," commented Hachigian.
"For 2008, we are now forecasting earnings per share from continuing operations to increase 14 to 17 percent to $3.58 to $3.67, exclusive of a fourth quarter charge and the $.11 tax benefits in 2008 and $.59 for unusual items in the prior year, with revenue growth in the range of 12 to 14 percent. For the fourth quarter of 2008, exclusive of a fourth quarter charge, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations of $.83 to $.92 with revenue growth in the range of 7 to 9 percent," said Hachigian.
