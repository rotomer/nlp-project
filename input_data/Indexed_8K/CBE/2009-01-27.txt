Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2008 Results of Operations On January 27, 2009, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow; the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio; and net income and earnings per share for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008, excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges offset by a lower tax rate. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Companys capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Companys debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt. Finally, Company management believes that adjusting income from continuing operations and earnings per share to exclude restructuring and asset impairment charges and tax related items provides investors with a more meaningful assessment of operating results for 2008 and the comparison to operating results for the comparable periods in 2007.

For Immediate Release
 Cooper Industries, Ltd. (NYSE: CBE) today reported fourth quarter 2008 earnings per share from continuing operations of $.65 (diluted), compared with $.98 for the fourth quarter of 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2008 Cooper recognized a pre-tax restructuring charge of $35.7 million or $.15 per share relating primarily to reductions in force. Cooper also recognized during the fourth quarter of 2008 a pre-tax $9.1 million impairment charge ($.04 per share) related to an investment in a joint venture operation. Excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, the fourth quarter 2008 earnings per share from continuing operations of $.84 is 1 percent higher than prior year results of $.83 (excluding Belden income and discrete tax items). Fourth quarter 2008 results include the favorable impact of a lower effective tax rate, impact from change in estimate for long-term stock compensation and other items which improved reported quarterly results by approximately $.09 per share. Fourth quarter 2008 revenues decreased 1 percent to $1.52 billion, compared with $1.54 billion for the same period last year. Excluding unusual items, income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter declined 6 percent to $143.7 million, compared with $152.7 million for the prior year's fourth quarter.
HOUSTON, January 27, 2009
"As the quarter progressed, the credit crisis deepened with the economic deterioration in the U.S. and Europe spreading around the world. Cooper earlier announced its intention to reduce our work force by over 1,000 employees and to take a fourth quarter charge estimated to be in the range of $20 million to $22 million. As economic conditions deteriorated, we determined it was necessary to increase the reduction in work force to in excess of 2,200 employees globally and recorded a restructuring charge of $35.7 million," said Cooper Industries' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian.
During 2008 Cooper generated $761 million in free cash flow after $137 million of capital expenditures. Total debt net of cash and investments totaled $952 million compared to $940 million at December 31, 2007. "Our free cash flow has exceeded continuing income, exclusive of tax accrual reversals, for the eighth year in a row. Our teams responded quickly to the dramatic changes in our markets and did an outstanding job adjusting production rates and improving working capital efficiency. We end the year with an excellent balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility to continue to invest in the long-term and return capital to our shareholders," said Hachigian.
Revenues for the twelve months of 2008 were $6.52 billion, a 10 percent increase from the $5.90 billion in revenues for the twelve months of 2007. For the twelve months of 2008, income from continuing operations excluding unusual items rose 8 percent to $630.8 million, compared with $582.8 million for the prior year's twelve months. Earnings per share from continuing operations excluding unusual items were $3.59 or up 14 percent, compared with prior year's $3.14.
As was previously announced on October 1, 2008, Cooper will not participate in the Federal Mogul Corporation Asbestos Trust and is instead proceeding under Plan B. Therefore, the Federal Mogul bankruptcy estate paid Cooper $141 million in early October. Cooper's financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities related to the on-going activities under Plan B. As a result of these adjustments, the Company recognized an after-tax discontinued operations income of $16.6 million or $.09 per share in the third quarter of 2008.
segment revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased 3 percent to $1.36 billion, compared with $1.32 billion in the fourth quarter 2007. Core revenues were flat for comparable periods with acquisitions contributing 6 percent and currency translation reducing reported results over 3 percent for the fourth quarter. Segment operating earnings excluding the impact of restructuring and asset impairment charges were $198.1 million a decrease of 9 percent from $216.6 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Segment operating margin excluding the unusual items decreased 180 basis points to 14.6 percent for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Absent favorable impact from long-term compensation and other items, segment operating earnings would have declined approximately 11 percent and segment operating margin would have been approximately 14 percent.

"The global recession resulted in weakness in all of our markets and geographies. Energy markets held up better than the other markets with residential and general industrial markets the weakest," said Hachigian.
Revenues for the twelve months of 2008 increased 13 percent to $5.76 billion, compared with $5.11 billion for the same period last year. Segment operating earnings excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges for the twelve months of 2008 increased to $930.3 million compared to $848.2 million in the prior-year period.
segment revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $165.1 million, down 25 percent from 2007 fourth quarter revenues of $220.5 million. Excluding the effects of currency translation, revenues for the quarter were approximately 20 percent lower than 2007 fourth quarter on declining industrial, retail and automotive demand. Segment operating earnings excluding restructuring charges were $17.5 million, down 39 percent from the fourth quarter 2007 levels of $28.6 million. Segment operating margin excluding restructuring charges for the fourth quarter 2008 was 10.6 percent compared to 13.0 percent for the comparable prior year period. Tools segment production was significantly curtailed to adjust to the lower volumes in the quarter and reduce inventory levels to reflect market conditions which negatively impacted the Tools segment performance for the quarter. Absent favorable impact from long-term incentive and other items, segment operating earnings would have declined over 40 percent and segment operating margin would have been approximately 9 percent.

Revenues for the twelve months of 2008 decreased 4 percent to $765.6 million, compared with $794.7 million for the same period last year. Segment operating earnings excluding restructuring charges for the twelve months of 2008 declined to $81.1 million, compared to $94.0 million in the prior-year period.
"We are very proud and grateful to our employees, customers and suppliers for making our 175 year a record performance. We are excited about the future of our end markets, global reach and trends in new technologies. We are also extremely well prepared to navigate a very difficult 2009 market environment. We have been refining our strategy, business initiatives and core values for several years and have great momentum as we enter these challenging times. Our balance sheet also provides us exceptional fire power to execute our long-term strategy," commented Hachigian.
Outlook
th
"For 2009 we now are forecasting earnings per share from continuing operations to decline to $2.45 to $2.80 with revenue declining in the range of 10 to 15 percent. For the first quarter of 2009, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations of $.45 to $.65 with revenue declines in the range of 10 to 15 percent. Given the trends in our markets in the fourth quarter, we are taking a conservative position and approach to 2009. As with prior years, we look forward to reviewing our detailed 2009 outlook on February 19 in New York City with the investment community," said Hachigian.
