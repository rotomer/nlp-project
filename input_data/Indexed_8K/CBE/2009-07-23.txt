Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Second Quarter 2009 Results of Operations. On July 23, 2009, Cooper Industries, Ltd. (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the second quarter of 2009. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow; the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio; and income from continuing operations and earnings per share for the second quarter 2009, excluding restructing charges for the second quarter of 2009. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Companys capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Companys debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt. Finally, Company management believes that adjusting income from continuing operations and earnings per share to exclude restructuring charges provides investors with a more meaningful assessment of operating results for 2009 and the comparison to operating results for the comparable periods in 2008.

During the second quarter of 2009 Cooper recognized a pre-tax restructuring charge of $10.4 million or $.05 per share relating primarily to reductions in workforce. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges, the second quarter 2009 earnings per share was $.58 per share compared to $.97 per share for earnings for the second quarter of 2008, excluding restructuring charges and currency related items. Second quarter 2009 revenues decreased 26 percent to $1.27 billion, compared with $1.72 billion for the same period last year. Core revenues were 23 percent lower than comparable prior year with currency translation reducing reported revenue by 3.5 percent for the quarter.
HOUSTON, July 23, 2009
"In the second quarter, while our book-to-bill ratio stabilized, we did not experience the normal seasonal increase in revenues. As a result, our revenue for the quarter was at the low end of our forecast, however, our intense cost management across the company allowed us to deliver earnings per share at the top end of the forecast," said Cooper Industries' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian.
During the first six months of 2009, Cooper generated a record $321.3 million in free cash flow after $55.9 million of capital expenditures compared with $208.4 million of free cash flow for the first six months of 2008. Our debt net of cash and investments totaled $748.7 million compared to $952.4 million at December 31, 2008. "Our global teams have done an outstanding job adjusting our cost structure and working capital levels to be aligned with current market conditions. As a result, our operating working capital decreased 26% from June 30, 2008 on a 26% revenue decline. We end the quarter with an excellent balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility to continue to invest in our long-term strategic initiatives and return capital to our shareholders," said Hachigian.
Revenues for the first six months of 2009 were $2.53 billion, a 23 percent decrease from the $3.27 billion in revenues for the first six months of 2008. For the first six months of 2009, net income from continuing operations excluding unusual items was $177.6 million, compared with $316.2 million for the prior year's first six months excluding unusual items. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding unusual items for comparable periods, were $1.05 compared with prior year's $1.78.
segment revenues for the second quarter of 2009 decreased 25 percent to $1.13 billion, compared with $1.51 billion in the second quarter 2008. Core revenues were 21.9 percent lower than comparable prior year periods with currency translation reducing reported results 3.2 percent for the second quarter. Segment operating earnings, excluding the impact of restructuring charges, were $153.5 million, a decrease of 41 percent from the $259.0 million in the prior year's second quarter. Segment operating margin, excluding the unusual items, decreased 360 basis points to 13.6 percent for the second quarter of 2009, compared to the second quarter of 2008. Sequentially from the first quarter of 2009, Electrical Products revenues were flat and segment operating margins increased 120 basis points, excluding unusual items.

Revenues for the first six months of 2009 decreased 21 percent to $2.26 billion, compared to $2.87 billion for the same period last year. Segment operating earnings for the first half of 2009 declined to $293.5 million excluding restructuring charges, compared to $482.5 million in the prior-year period.
segment revenues for the second quarter of 2009 were $138.7 million, down 35 percent from 2008 second quarter revenues of $214.3 million. Excluding the effects of currency translation, which reduced reported revenues in the quarter by 5.8 percent, core revenues for the quarter were 29.5 percent lower than 2008 second quarter on substantially lower industrial, retail and automotive demand. Segment operating earnings, excluding restructuring charges, was a profit of $2.9 million, compared to the second quarter 2008 earnings of $22.3 million, also excluding restructuring charges. Segment operating margin, excluding restructuring charges, for the second quarter 2009 was 2.1 percent compared to 10.4 percent for the comparable prior year period. Tools segment production was significantly curtailed to adjust to the lower volumes in the quarter and reduce inventory levels to reflect market conditions which negatively impacted the Tools segment performance for the quarter. Sequentially from the first quarter of 2009, Tools segment revenues increased 10 percent and segment operating margins increased 520 basis points, excluding unusual items.

Revenues for the first six months of 2009 decreased 34% to $265.0 million, compared to $398.8 million for the same period last year. Segment operating earnings for the first six months of 2009 was a loss of $1.0 million, compared to an operating profit of $39.5 million in the prior year period.
"Our employees have rapidly and efficiently right-sized our businesses for the current market conditions, positioning us to successfully navigate a very difficult market environment. We remain confident that our strategy, business initiatives and core values established over the last several years along with the actions we have taken in the current market environment, position us to emerge from the current economic cycle stronger and with exceptional growth capabilities and increased earnings power. Our balance sheet also provides an exceptional resource to execute our long-term strategy," commented Hachigian.
Outlook
"For 2009, we now are forecasting earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.30 to $2.50, excluding restructuring and unusual items, compared to $2.30 to $2.60 given in April 2009. For the year, we currently expect to incur $.15 to $.18 per share of restructuring charges. The low end of our forecast of $2.30 per share assumes revenues remain flat with the revenue levels achieved in the first half of the year. For the third quarter of 2009, we expect earnings per share of $.60 to $.70, excluding restructuring and unusual items. In the third quarter of 2009, we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of $.05 per share. Free cash flow after capital expenditures for the full year is expected to exceed $500 million," said Hachigian.
