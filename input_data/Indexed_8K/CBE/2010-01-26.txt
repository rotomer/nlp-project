Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2009 Results of Operations. On January 26, 2010, Cooper Industries plc (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2009. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow; the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio; and income from continuing operations and earnings per share for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2009, excluding restructing and asset impairment charges offset by a discrete tax item. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Companys capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash f low to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Companys debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt. Finally, Company management believes that adjusting income from continuing operations and earnings per share to exclude restructuring and asset impairment charges and discrete tax items provides investors with a more meaningful assessment of operating results for 2009 and the comparison to operating results for the comparable periods in 2008.

 Cooper Industries plc (NYSE: CBE) reported fourth quarter 2009 GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $.76 (diluted), compared with $.65 per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2008. During the fourth quarter of 2009 Cooper recognized a pre-tax restructuring and asset impairment charge of $4.2 million or $.02 per share related primarily to reductions in work force offset by discrete tax items which improved reported results by $.02 per share. Excluding these unusual items, the fourth quarter 2009 earnings per share was $.76 per share compared to $.84 per share earnings for the fourth quarter of 2008, excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges. The fourth quarter 2009 results also included the favorable impact of a lower effective tax rate and inventory revaluations partially offset by other items which improved reported quarterly results by approximately $.04 per share. The fourth quarter 2008 results include the favorable impact of a lower effective tax rate, impact from a change in estimate for long-term incentive compensation and other items which improved reported quarterly results by approximately $.09 per share. Adjusting for these items on a non-GAAP basis the fourth quarter 2009 results of $.72 per share compares to $.75 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter 2009 revenues decreased 17.5 percent to $1.26 billion, compared with $1.52 billion for the same period last year. Core revenues were 19.8 percent lower than comparable prior year with currency translation increasing reported revenue by 2.0 percent and acquisitions adding 0.3 percent for the quarter.
Dublin, Ireland, January 26, 2010
"Our employees rapidly and efficiently right-sized our businesses for the economic challenges faced in 2009, allowing the company to improve earnings sequentially in the fourth quarter. As we begin to see growth in several of our end markets, our businesses are very well positioned to capitalize on the improvements with exceptional earnings growth," said Cooper Industries' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian.
During 2009 Cooper generated $632.6 million in free cash flow (including a $90 million discretionary income tax deposit) compared with the record $761.2 million for 2008. Our total debt net of cash and investments totaled $552.8 million compared to $952.4 million at December 31, 2008. "Our global teams have delivered exceptional free cash flow, in fact a record for the company excluding the $141 million received in 2008 from Federal-Mogul and the $90 million discretionary tax payment in 2009. As a result of our record cash flow, we were able to retire our $275 million debt obligation in November from available cash and preserve our financial flexibility to continue to invest in our long-term strategic initiatives and return capital to our shareholders," said Hachigian.
Revenues for 2009 were $5.1 billion, a 22.3 percent decrease from the $6.5 billion in revenues for 2008. Core revenues were 20.9 percent lower than the comparable prior year period with currency translation reducing reported revenue by 2.0 percent and acquisitions adding 0.6 percent to reported revenues for 2009. For 2009 income from continuing operations, excluding unusual items, was $425.2 million, compared with $630.8 million for the prior year, excluding unusual items. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding unusual items for comparable periods, were $2.52 compared with prior year's $3.59.
During 2009 Cooper recognized a gain from discontinued operations of $25.5 million (net of tax of $16.2 million) or $.15 per share from negotiated insurance coverage settlements that were not previously recognized. Cooper believes that it is likely that additional insurance recoveries will be recorded in the future as new insurance-in-place agreements are consummated or settlements with insurance carriers are completed. Timing and value of these agreements and settlements cannot be currently estimated as they may be subject to extensive additional negotiation and litigation.
segment revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased 18.8 percent to $1.10 billion, compared with $1.36 billion in the fourth quarter 2008. Core revenues were 20.6 percent lower than comparable prior year periods with currency translation increasing reported results 1.5 percent and acquisitions adding 0.3 percent to reported revenues for the fourth quarter. Segment operating earnings, excluding the impact of restructuring and asset impairment charges, were $171.2 million, a decrease of 14 percent from the $198.1 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Segment operating margin, excluding the unusual items, increased 90 basis points to 15.5 percent for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Sequentially from the third quarter of 2009, Electrical Products revenues were approximately 4 percent lower driven by normal seasonality and delays in distributor purchases prior to year end with segment operating margins increasing 40 basis points, excluding unusual items.

"We are extremely pleased with how well our businesses adjusted to the economic realities of 2009. Cooper's portfolio, management team and balance sheet is stronger than it has been in over a decade. We enter 2010 with strong profitability on a significantly lower revenue base and are in a great position to deliver outstanding increased earnings as the global economies recover," commented Hachigian.
Outlook
"For 2010 we are initiating EPS guidance for continuing operations of $2.70 to $2.90, excluding restructuring and unusual items, with revenue down 1 percent to up 4 percent including currency translation and acquisition revenue of approximately 2 percent. For the first quarter of 2010 we expect earnings per share of $.65 to $.70, excluding restructuring and unusual items, with revenue down 3 percent to up 2 percent compared to both the first quarter 2009 and sequentially with the fourth quarter 2009 results. In the first quarter of 2010 we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of $.01 to $.02 per share. Consistent with prior years, we look forward to reviewing our detailed 2010 outlook with the investment community on February 23 in New York City," said Hachigian.
