 Cooper Industries plc (NYSE:CBE) today announced the appointment of David A. Barta to the position of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective May 17, 2010. Barta will report to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian.
Dublin, Ireland, April 27, 2010
Barta is replacing Terry A. Klebe, who announced his intent to retire earlier this year. Klebe has been named Vice Chairman and will continue to report directly to the CEO, serving on the Tools Joint Venture Board and working on other special assignments.
Barta joins Cooper from Regal-Beloit Corporation where he served as the Chief Financial Officer for the past six years. Prior to that, he spent nine years with Newell Rubbermaid, Inc. serving in a number of increasingly responsible finance positions, most recently as the Chief Financial Officer of the Levolor/Kirsch division. Before joining Newell, Barta spent six years with Harman International Industries in a number of successive assignments in the finance function.
"Dave Barta brings to Cooper a wealth of experience and a long list of accomplishments," said Cooper Industries Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian. "He has over two decades of experience with multi-national industrial companies and has proven leadership capabilities overseeing all functions of a financial organization, including accounting, treasury, tax, audit, investor relations and driving operational initiatives. For the last six years, he has been the Chief Financial Officer for a company that has a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth while improving cash flow and maintaining a conservative balance
sheet. We are confident that Dave will bring the same strong business leadership to Cooper that Terry Klebe has provided us with as CFO for the last eight years."
Barta earned a Law Degree, Masters Degree in Business Administration and Bachelors Degree in Accounting from Indiana University.
