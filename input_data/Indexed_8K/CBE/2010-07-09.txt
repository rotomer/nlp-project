 Cooper Industries plc (NYSE:CBE) and Danaher Corporation (NYSE: DHR) today announced the completion of the joint venture combining Cooper's Tools business with certain tools businesses from Danaher Corporation's Tools and Components segment.
Dublin, Ireland, July 6, 2010
The joint venture, which was previously announced in March 2010, will be named Apex Tool Group, LLC. Under the joint venture agreement Cooper and Danaher each will own a 50% share of the new company and have equal representation on the joint venture's Board of Directors. Steve Breitzka, former President Danaher Tool Group, will lead the joint venture as Chief Executive Officer.
"We are extremely excited about the creation of this global tools business with Danaher, which we expect to deliver long-term value creation to our shareholders, customers and employees. We are confident that the joint venture's management team will successfully capitalize on the synergies that are inherent in combining these two businesses. Cooper will continue to focus on growing our core electrical products business by executing on our organic growth initiatives of customer loyalty, innovation and globalization and utilizing our exceptionally strong balance sheet for strategic acquisitions," said Cooper Industries Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian.
It is anticipated that Cooper will recognize a net after-tax loss in the second quarter of 2010 related to the transaction currently estimated at approximately $90 million or $0.53 per share. This non-cash loss will be principally related to the recognition of the cumulative currency translation. Excluding the effect of the non-cash loss, it is anticipated that the joint venture will have an immaterial impact on Cooper's 2010 forecasted Free Cash Flow and Earnings Per Share. Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, the Tools Segment will be deconsolidated in Cooper's consolidated financial statements and reflected as an equity investment on Cooper's balance sheet and as equity earnings from a joint venture in the consolidated income statement.
