Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Second Quarter 2010 Results of Operations. On July 22, 2010, Cooper Industries plc (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the second quarter 2010. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow; the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio; and income from continuing operations and earnings per share for the second quarter 2010, excluding a non-cash after-tax charge. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Companys capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for d etermining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Companys debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt. Finally, Company management believes that adjusting income from continuing operations and earnings per share to exclude the non-cash after-tax charge provides investors with a more meaningful assessment of operating results for 2010 and the comparison to operating results for the comparable periods in 2009.

"In the second quarter, for the first time in 18 months, we delivered core revenue growth as our industrial businesses remained strong, emerging markets continued to grow and our longer cycle businesses gained momentum. Our intense cost management across the company and the favorable impact from previous resizing efforts allowed us to deliver strong incremental earnings growth as adjusted earnings per share increased 51 percent," said Cooper Industries' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian.
During the first half of 2010 Cooper generated $222.5 million in free cash flow, our second best first half performance in the Company's history. Our total debt net of cash as of June 30, 2010 totaled $503.3 million. "Our global teams continue to deliver solid free cash flow, a result of our improved earnings performance and continued working capital efficiency. We are anticipating continuing this performance in the second half and remain confident that 2010 will be the tenth consecutive year that we will generate free cash flow in excess of recurring income," said Hachigian.
Revenues for the first six months of 2010 were $2.57 billion, a 1.5 percent increase from the $2.53 billion in revenues for the first six months of 2009. For the first six months of 2010, net income excluding the loss on the Tools Joint venture was $253.9 million, compared with $170.5 million from continuing operations for the prior year's first six months. Diluted earnings per share, excluding the non-cash charge related to the Tools Joint Venture, were $1.50 compared with prior year's $1.01 from continuing operations.
On July 6, 2010, Cooper announced the completion of the Joint Venture, named Apex Tool Group, LLC. Cooper and Danaher Corporation each own a 50 percent interest in the Joint Venture. The Tools assets and liabilities to be contributed to the Joint Venture in July 2010 have been reclassified to separate lines in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The second quarter 2010 results include a non-cash after-tax charge of $93.7 million or $.55 per share primarily related to the recognition of cumulative translation losses included in other nonowner changes in equity through the income statement.
During the first quarter of 2009 Cooper recognized a gain from discontinued operations of $18.9 million (net of tax of $12.0 million) or $.11 per share from negotiated insurance coverage settlements consummated in the first quarter of 2009 that were not previously recognized.

"While we are encouraged by improving conditions in our end markets, we remain cautious about the global economic recovery and will continue to stay focused on cost management, funding strategic core investments and delivering solid incremental earnings growth. Long-term, we remain optimistic about the future of our electrical products portfolio and our diverse end market exposure that allows us to capitalize on emerging technologies and key market trends. Additionally, our strong balance sheet provides us great strategic flexibility," commented Hachigian.
Outlook
"For 2010 we are increasing our EPS guidance for continuing operations to $2.95 to $3.10, excluding the loss from the formation of the Tools Joint Venture. Our revised guidance now includes approximately $.06 per share of purchase accounting charges related to the Tools Joint Venture. This guidance assumes full-year revenue growth of 1 to 4 percent adjusted for the deconsolidation of the Tools segment. For the third quarter of 2010 we expect earnings per share of $.75 to $.80 with revenue up 2 to 5 percent compared to the third quarter of 2009, adjusted for the deconsolidation of the Tools segment. The third quarter guidance includes additional restructuring charges of $.01 to $.02 per share," said Hachigian.
