Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Third Quarter 2010 Results of Operations. On October 21, 2010, Cooper Industries plc (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the third quarter 2010. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow; the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio; and income from continuing operations and earnings per share for the third quarter 2010, excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Companys capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Companys debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt. Finally, Company management believes that adjusting income from continuing operations and earnings per share to exclude restructuring and asset impairment charges provides investors with a more meaningful assessment of operating results for 2010 and the comparison to operating results for the comparable periods in 2009.

Dublin, Ireland, October 21, 2010
"In the third quarter, we reported the highest core growth rate we have experienced in nearly three years, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio of businesses and success of our key initiatives. Our core growth has accelerated from the first half of the year, with our longer cycle businesses gaining additional momentum and continuing strength in our industrial businesses. Investments made over the last several years in new product development, especially in key energy-efficient technologies, and our increasing presence in emerging markets have continued to strengthen our growth profile. While making these investments, we continue to drive margin improvements through operational excellence as evidenced by the 25 percent growth in continuing operations earnings per share in the third quarter," said Cooper Industries' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian.
Revenues for the first nine months of 2010 were $3.49 billion, a 2.5 percent increase from the $3.41 billion in revenues for the first nine months of 2009, excluding the Tools segment revenues. For the first nine months of 2010, net income excluding the loss on the Tools Joint venture recognized in the second quarter was $395.6 million, compared with $284.8 million from continuing operations for the prior year's first nine months. Diluted earnings per share were $2.34 compared with prior year's $1.69 from continuing operations.
During the first nine months of 2010 Cooper generated $334.5 million in free cash flow. Our total debt net of cash as of September 30, 2010 totaled $636.7 million, a 17.4 percent net debt to capitalization ratio. "Our ability to generate strong free cash flow through all business cycles provides us with flexibility to execute a well balanced capital allocation program. We continue to fund our core growth and are seeing an improving pipeline for acquisitions. Additionally, we maintain our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders, increasing our dividend by 8 percent in February of this year and repurchasing 6.2 million shares year-to-date. We remain confident that 2010 will be the tenth consecutive year that we will generate free cash flow in excess of recurring income," said Hachigian.
 Segment Results
segment revenues for the third quarter of 2010 increased 7.2 percent to $655.7 million, compared with $611.8 million in the third quarter 2009. Cores revenues were 7.5 percent higher than the comparable prior year period with currency translation decreasing reported revenues 1.8 percent and acquisitions adding 1.5 percent for the third quarter.

Electrical Products Group
Revenues for the first nine months of 2010 increased 4.7 percent to $1.65 billion, compared to $1.58 billion for the same period last year. Segment operating earnings for the first nine months of 2010 increased to $250.3 million compared to $185.9 million in the prior-year period.
As a result of the creation of the Apex Tool Group joint venture on July 4, 2010, the Tools business was deconsolidated for the third quarter 2010. Cooper and Danaher Corporation each own a 50 percent interest in the Joint Venture. Equity income from the Apex Tool Group joint venture of $10.5 million is included in operating earnings in the third quarter 2010. Tools reported operating earnings of $6.8 million in the third quarter of 2009. The second quarter 2010 results included a non-cash after-tax charge related to the formation of the JV of $93.7 million or $.55 per share which was primarily related to the recognition of cumulative translation losses.
 Outlook
"We are encouraged by the improving conditions in our end markets and our teams' ability to deliver solid incremental earnings growth. Our diverse portfolio and end-market exposure have us well positioned for solid growth in 2011 and beyond as our later cycle businesses gain momentum. We will continue to fund our core businesses, invest in innovative new products and technologies and increase our presence in strategic international markets to drive future growth. Our balance sheet provides us with continued flexibility to make strategic acquisitions and return capital to shareholders," commented Hachigian.
"For 2010 we are increasing our EPS guidance for continuing operations to a range of $3.14 to $3.18, excluding the loss from the formation of the Tools Joint Venture. This guidance assumes full-year revenue growth of 3 to 5 percent adjusted for the deconsolidation of the Tools segment. For the fourth quarter of 2010 we expect earnings per share of $.80 to $.84 with revenue up 7 to 10 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, adjusted for the deconsolidation of the Tools segment," said Hachigian.
