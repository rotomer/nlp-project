Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2010 Results of Operations. On January 26, 2011, Cooper Industries plc (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2010. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow; the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio; and income from continuing operations and earnings per share for the fiscal year 2010, excluding the loss related to net assets contributed to the Tools Joint Venture. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Companys capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Compa ny's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Companys debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt. Finally, Company management believes that adjusting income from continuing operations and earnings per share to exclude the loss related to net assets contributed to the Tools Joint Venture in 2010 provides investors with a more meaningful assessment of operating results for 2010 and the comparison to operating results for the comparable periods in 2009.

For Immediate Release
 Cooper Industries plc (NYSE: CBE) reported core revenue growth of 14.1 percent as revenue reached $1.26 billion compared with $1.10 billion for the same period last year, excluding Tools segment revenue in 2009. Fourth quarter 2010 earnings per share from operations increased 12 percent to $.85 (diluted) compared with $.76 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009. For the quarter currency translation reduced reported revenues by 0.6 percent and acquisitions added 0.7 percent compared to the prior year.
Dublin, Ireland, January 26, 2011
"We are very pleased to report record core revenue growth in the fourth quarter for the combined Electrical Segments, a result of the improving conditions in our global end-markets and the continued success of our key growth initiatives. Our core growth accelerated in the quarter, as our industrial markets remained strong, utility markets continued to improve and demand for energy-efficient lighting technologies such as LED gained additional momentum. Additionally, we benefited from previous investments in strategic growth initiatives as both new product sales and international sales as a percent of total revenues were at all-time highs in the quarter. Incremental margins were somewhat muted by increasing commodity costs, the negative fixed cost absorption impact of inventory reductions and non-recurring legal and acquisition costs," said Cooper Industries' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian.
Revenues for the twelve months of 2010 were $4.75 billion, a 5.4 percent increase from the $4.51 billion in revenues for the twelve months of 2009, excluding the Tools segment revenues. For 2010, net income excluding the loss on the Tools Joint Venture recognized in the second quarter was $537.5 million, compared with $413.6 million from continuing operations for the prior year of 2009. Diluted earnings per share of $3.20, excluding the loss on the Tools Joint Venture, increased 30.1 percent compared with prior year's earnings per share of $2.46 from continuing operations.
During 2010 Cooper generated $606.6 million in free cash flow. Our total debt net of cash as of December 31was $393.4 million, which results in a 10.9 percent net debt to capitalization ratio. "This is the tenth consecutive year we have reported free cash flow from operations greater than earnings from continuing operations. Our ability to generate strong free cash flow through all business cycles has provided us the flexibility to execute a consistent, well balanced capital allocation program. During the fourth quarter, we successfully issued $250 million of 5-year senior unsecured notes and $250 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at a blended interest rate of 3.125 percent. With an exceptionally strong balance sheet, we continued to fund our core growth initiatives and are well positioned to capitalize on an improving acquisition pipeline as demonstrated by the three acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 around our strategic growth platforms," said Hachigian.
segment revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 15.0 percent to $676.7 million, compared with $588.5 million in the fourth quarter 2009. Cores revenues were 14.9 percent higher than the comparable prior year period with currency translation decreasing reported revenues 1.2 percent and acquisitions adding 1.3 percent. Segment operating earnings were $113.8 million, an increase of over 21 percent from the $93.8 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Segment operating margin increased 90 basis points to 16.8 percent for the fourth quarter 2010, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result of previous and ongoing cost reduction actions and favorable leverage of fixed costs from higher revenue.
Segment Results
Energy & Safety Solutions
Revenues for the twelve months of 2010 increased 4.1 percent to $2.52 billion, compared to $2.42 billion for 2009. Segment operating earnings for 2010 increased to $424.7 million, compared to $374.9 million in the prior-year. For 2010 the segment operating margin increased 140 basis points to 16.9 percent, compared to the twelve months of 2009.
segment revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 13.3 percent to $583.2 million, compared with $514.6 million in the fourth quarter 2009. Core revenues were 13.0 percent higher than prior year, with currency translation increasing reported results 0.2 percent and acquisitions adding 0.1 percent. Segment operating earnings were $80.4 million, an increase of nearly 4 percent from the $77.4 million reported in the prior year's fourth quarter. Segment operating margin decreased 120 basis points to 13.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 driven by the under absorption of fixed costs as a result of reductions in inventory, increasing commodity costs, prior year LIFO benefits and continued facility rationalization.
Electrical Products Group
Revenues for the full year 2010 increased 6.8 percent to $2.24 billion, compared to $2.10 billion for the same period last year. Segment operating earnings for the twelve months of 2010 increased to $330.7 million compared to $263.3 million in the prior-year period.
As a result of the creation of the Apex Tool Group joint venture on July 4, 2010, the Tools business was deconsolidated in the third quarter 2010. Equity income from the Apex Tool Group joint venture of $12.3 million is included in operating earnings in the fourth quarter 2010. Tools segment reported operating earnings of $12.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The second quarter 2010 results included a non-cash after-tax charge related to the formation of the JV of $93.7 million or $.56 per share which was primarily related to the recognition of cumulative translation losses.
"We exit 2010 with strong core revenue growth performance, improving end-markets, and an exceptionally strong balance sheet. Our diverse portfolio and exposure to emerging global markets, innovative products and technologies have us well positioned for solid growth in 2011 and beyond. We will continue to fund our core businesses, invest in new products and technologies and increase our presence in strategic international markets to drive future growth. Our balance sheet provides us with the financial flexibility to make strategic acquisitions and continue to return capital to our shareholders," commented Hachigian.
Outlook
"For 2011 we are forecasting earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.60 to $3.80. This guidance assumes full-year revenue growth of 6 to 9 percent, excluding Tools segment revenue from 2010. For the first quarter of 2011 we expect earnings per share of $.80 to $.84 with revenue up 10 to 14 percent compared to the first quarter of 2010, again excluding Tools revenue. First quarter 2011 guidance includes a tax rate assumption of 19 to 20 percent which negatively impacts results by approximately $.05 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2010," said Hachigian.
