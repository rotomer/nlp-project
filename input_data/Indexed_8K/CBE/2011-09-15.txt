 Cooper Industries plc (NYSE:CBE) today updated its outlook for the third quarter and full year 2011 and provided a preliminary outlook for 2012.
Dublin, Ireland, September 15, 2011
Cooper expects fully diluted earnings per share for the 3 quarter to be in the range of $0.94-$0.98. Sales are expected to increase 9% to 12% versus the third quarter of 2010, including the revenue contribution from the Martek and Gitiesse acquisitions (approximately $25 million). Cooper expects fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal year 2011 to be in the range of $3.75-$3.82.

"Although we are disappointed in the reduced expectations for the 3 quarter and full year 2011, our third quarter expected EPS reflects a strong increase of 11-15% versus the third quarter of 2010, and our full year EPS results, on a continuing basis, are a record performance for the Company and a 17% increase over 2010 at the mid-point of our guidance," commented Kirk Hachigian, Cooper's Chairman and CEO. "We remain committed to growth through investments in new product innovation, globalization and acquisitions as we make short-term adjustments to improve our production efficiency and overhead structure. Our capital structure continues to allow us wide flexibility to maximize the return to our shareholders."
rd
This modification of guidance is a result of:
As of September 15, 2011, the company has repurchased over 6.5 million shares in the third quarter, resulting in year-to-date repurchases of approximately 7 million shares during 2011, resulting in shares outstanding of less than 160 million shares.
"We are confident that we will realize the benefits from the investments we have made consistent with our strategy. The strategic growth investments we have made in our core businesses in 2011, and previously, have us well-positioned to deliver strong, sustainable future growth." commented Hachigian. "Our preliminary outlook for 2012 is for mid-single digit core revenue growth and double-digit earnings per share growth."
Cooper will participate in the 2011 Citi Global Industrials Conference held in Boston, Massachusetts on Wednesday, September 21. The presentation and comments by Cooper's Chief Executive Officer Kirk Hachigian will begin at approximately 9:40 a.m. eastern time.
