Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
Third Quarter 2011 Results of Operations. On October 20, 2011, Cooper Industries plc (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the third quarter 2011. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow and the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release. Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides investors an efficient means by which they can evaluate the Companys capacity in the period to reduce debt, repurchase shares and make acquisitions or other investments. Management also uses free cash flow to assess the Company's operating performance and includes free cash flow as a criteria for determining incentive compensation for key employees. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio provides investors with a supplemental ratio that reflects the Companys debt leverage if the Company were to use its cash to pay down debt.

 Cooper Industries plc (NYSE: CBE) today reported record earnings per share of $.98 on net income of $160.2 million for the third quarter of 2011 compared to earnings per share of $.85 on net income of $141.7 million for the same period last year. Third quarter 2011 revenues increased $149 million, or 12.0%, to $1.39 billion from revenues of $1.24 billion in the third quarter of the prior year. Core revenue growth was 7.1%, with currency translation adding 1.6% to reported revenues and acquisitions adding 3.3% when compared to the prior year. Total operating profit margin was 14.8% for the third quarter of 2011 and 15.4% in the same period last year.
Dublin, Ireland, October 20, 2011
"Our investments continued to gain momentum as we saw developing markets' core revenue grow 14 percent. In addition, new product vitality, representing sales of products developed in the last three years, was a record 28% of total revenue. Our Company-wide strategic initiatives and proven business model have now delivered seven quarters of consecutive double-digit earnings per share growth, with the current quarter representing record earnings per share from continuing operations. Our longer cycle and international businesses continued to produce strong results in the face of macro uncertainty, while demand from non-residential and residential construction markets remains soft. Investments made over the last several years in new product development, targeted verticals, and our increased presence in emerging markets have continued to strengthen our growth profile," said Cooper Industries Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian.
During the first nine months of 2011 Cooper reported free cash flow of $358.0 million, excluding the $250 million asbestos trust settlement payment. "During the quarter, we repurchased over 7 million shares, continuing to show a balanced approach to investing in our core, while returning cash to shareholders," said Hachigian. The company's total debt net of cash as of September 30 was $997.2 million, which resulted in a 22.4% net debt to capitalization ratio. "Our ability to generate strong free cash flow through all business cycles provides us with flexibility to execute a well balanced capital allocation program. Year to date, we have repurchased 7.8 million shares while increasing our dividend by 7 percent in February," said Hachigian.
Operating margin was down versus the same period last year as a result of:
segment revenues for the third quarter of 2011 increased 14.7% to $752.2 million, compared with $655.7 million in the third quarter 2010. Core revenues were 9.3% higher than the comparable prior year period, with currency translation increasing reported revenues 2.5% and acquisitions adding 2.9%. Core revenue growth was primarily related to continued demand for utility products with solid demand from global industrial and energy markets.
Segment Results
Energy & Safety Solutions
Segment operating earnings were $125.6 million, an increase of 13.1% from the $111.1 million in the prior year's third quarter. Segment operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 16.7% for the third quarter 2011, compared to 16.9% for the third quarter of 2010.
segment revenues for the third quarter of 2011 increased 9.0% to $637.5 million, compared with $585.0 million in the third quarter 2010. Core revenues were 4.6% higher than prior year, with currency translation increasing reported results 0.7% and acquisitions adding 3.7%. Core revenue growth was driven primarily by demand for energy efficient products and broad industrial demand, offset partially by slowing demand for electronic components and the already weak residential and non-residential construction markets.
Electrical Products Group
Segment operating earnings were $88.3 million, a decrease of 6.3% from the $94.2 million reported in the prior year's third quarter. Segment operating margin decreased 220 basis points to 13.9% for the third quarter of 2011, compared to a record 16.1% for the third quarter of 2010.
As a result of the creation of the Apex Tool Group joint venture on July 4, 2010, the Tools business was deconsolidated beginning with the third quarter 2010. Equity income from the Apex Tool Group joint venture of $16.0 million is included in operating earnings in the third quarter 2011, compared to equity income of $10.5 million in the third quarter of 2010.
Tools Joint Venture
"We remain committed to delivering a balance of growth, margin expansion and cash generation. We expect 2011 full year earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.78 to $3.83 compared to previously revised guidance of $3.75 to $3.82 earnings per share. This guidance now assumes full-year revenue growth of 11 to 13 percent, excluding Tools segment revenue from 2010. For the fourth quarter of 2011 we expect earnings per share of $.91 to $.96 on core revenue growth of 1 to 3 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2010," said Hachigian.
