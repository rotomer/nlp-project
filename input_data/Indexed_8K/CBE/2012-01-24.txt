Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Results of Operations.
On January 24, 2012, Cooper Industries plc (the "Company") issued the press release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 setting forth the Company's results of operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2011. The press release includes a reference to free cash flow and the Company's net debt-to-total capitalization ratio; and income from continuing operations and earnings per share for the fiscal year 2011. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the press release.
Company management believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding the Company's ability to generate cash without reliance on external financings. In addition, management uses free cash flow to evaluate resources available for investments in the business, strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Company management believes that the net debt-to-total capitalization ratio is a useful measure regarding the Company's financial leverage for evaluating the Company's ability to meet its funding needs. Finally, Company management believes that adjusting 2010 income from continuing operations and earnings per share to exclude the loss on the Tools joint venture provides investors a more meaningful assessment of 2010 operating results and the comparison to 2011 operating results.

 Cooper Industries plc (NYSE: CBE) today reported an all-time quarterly record earnings per share of $1.00, up 18% compared to earnings per share of $.85 for the same period last year. Fourth quarter 2011 revenues increased $113 million, or 9.0%, to $1.37 billion compared to revenues of $1.26 billion in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Core revenue growth was 4.7%, with acquisitions adding 4.5% and currency translation reducing reported revenues by 0.2% when compared to the prior year. Total operating profit margin was 14.6% for the fourth quarter of 2011 and 14.3% in the same period last year.
Dublin, Ireland, January 24, 2012
"For the full year 2011 Cooper reported record earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.87, an increase of 21%, compared to $3.20 per share for 2010 (excluding the loss related to the formation of the Tools joint venture). When compared to the previous record earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.59 reported in 2008, Cooper accomplished this performance on 6% lower revenues, excluding Tools segment revenue in 2008. Our Company-wide strategic initiatives and proven business model now have delivered eight quarters of double-digit earnings per share growth. Our new product vitality, which represents revenues from sales of products developed in the last three years, was a record 29% of total revenue and our percentage of sales derived from outside the United States reached a record 40%. Our longer cycle and international businesses produced solid results in the face of macro uncertainty, while demand from non-residential and residential construction markets remains stable," said Cooper Industries Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian.
During 2011 Cooper reported free cash flow of $702.4 million, excluding the $250 million asbestos trust settlement payment. The company's total debt net of cash as of December 31 was $751.0 million, which resulted in a 17.5% net debt to capitalization ratio. "Free cash flow was greater than net income from continuing operations for the 11 consecutive year, demonstrating our ability to generate strong free cash flow through all business cycles and provide us flexibility to execute a well balanced capital allocation program. For 2011 we allocated approximately $1.3 billion in capital in order to reinvest in our core business, acquire strategic assets and return cash to shareholders. For the year, we repurchased 8.0 million shares while increasing our dividend by 7 percent in February," said Hachigian.
th
Operating margin in the fourth quarter was up versus the same period last year despite headwinds from:
segment revenues for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 9.7% to $742.4 million, compared with $676.7 million in the fourth quarter 2010. Core revenues were 6.9% higher than the comparable prior year period, with acquisitions adding 3.1% and currency translation reducing reported revenues by 0.3%. Core revenue growth was primarily related to continued demand for utility products with solid demand from global industrial and energy markets.
Segment Results
Energy & Safety Solutions
Segment operating earnings were $118.9 million, an increase of 4.5% from the $113.8 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Segment operating margin decreased 80 basis points to 16.0% for the fourth quarter 2011, compared to 16.8% for the fourth quarter of 2010. Segment operating margin was down primarily due to a mix shift toward project-based business versus the same period last year.
segment revenues for the fourth quarter of 2011 increased 8.1% to $630.7 million, compared with $583.2 million in the fourth quarter 2010. Core revenues were 2.2% higher than prior year, with acquisitions adding 6.1% and currency translation decreasing reported results by 0.2%. Core revenue growth was driven primarily by demand for energy efficient products and broad industrial demand, offset partially by the continued weak residential and non-residential construction markets.
Electrical Products Group
Segment operating earnings were $83.7 million, an increase of 4.1% from the $80.4 million reported in the prior year's fourth quarter. Segment operating margin decreased 50 basis points to 13.3% for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to a record 13.8% for the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and incremental restructuring versus the fourth quarter last year, segment operating margin expanded 30 basis points.
As a result of the creation of the Apex Tool Group joint venture on July 4, 2010, the Tools business was deconsolidated beginning with the third quarter 2010. Equity income from the Apex Tool Group joint venture of $21.9 million is included in operating earnings in the fourth quarter 2011, compared to equity income of $12.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Tools Joint Venture
"For 2012 we are forecasting earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.15  $4.35. This guidance assumes full-year revenue growth of 5 to 7 percent. For the first quarter of 2012 we expect earnings per share of $.97 to $1.01 on revenue growth of 4 to 6 percent. Investments made over the last several years in new product development, targeted verticals, and our increased presence in emerging markets have continued to strengthen our growth profile. While making these investments, we continue to drive margin improvements through operational excellence resulting in a forecasted improvement in operating earnings greater than 20 percent. Consistent with prior years, we look forward to reviewing our detailed 2012 outlook with the investment community on February 28 in New York City," said Hachigian.
