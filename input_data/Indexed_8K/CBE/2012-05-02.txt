Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
 
 Cooper Industries plc (NYSE: CBE) today reported record first quarter earnings per share of $1.00, an increase of 8% compared to earnings per share of $.93 for the same period last year. The Company incurred an SG&A expense of $11.7 million primarily relating to an environmental matter which dates to the 1950's. Excluding the impact of the legacy environmental reserve, first quarter earnings per share were $1.06, an increase of 14% compared to the same period last year. Total operating profit margin was 15.1% for the first quarter of 2012 and 15.5% in the same period last year. The profit margin was also negatively impacted by newly acquired businesses which contributed $44.2 million in revenue and a loss of $0.3 million. Adjusting for the legacy environmental reserve and the impact of acquisitions, operating profit margin would have been 16.4%, an increase of 90 basis points versus the first quarter of 2011. First quarter 2012 revenues increased $125.9 million, or 9.8%, to $1.40 billion compared to revenues of $1.28 billion in the first quarter of the prior year. This represents record first quarter revenues for Cooper's combined Electrical Segments. Core revenue growth was 6.8%, with acquisitions adding 3.5% and currency translation reducing reported revenues by 0.5% when compared to the prior year.
Dublin, Ireland, May 2, 2012
As of March 31, Cooper continued to maintain a strong balance sheet with total debt net of cash of $811.9 million and a net debt to capitalization ratio of 17.9%. The Company reported free cash flow of $18.2 million during the quarter and continued a balanced and disciplined capital deployment strategy by increasing the quarterly dividend 7 percent and completing two acquisitions for approximately $57 million.
 
Segment Results
segment revenues for the first quarter of 2012 increased 10.4% to $751.7 million, compared with $680.8 million in the first quarter 2011. Core revenues were 9.7% higher than the comparable prior year period, with acquisitions adding 1.5% and currency translation reducing reported revenues by 0.8%. Core revenue growth was driven by continued demand for utility products with strong demand from global industrial and energy markets.
Energy & Safety Solutions
Segment operating earnings were $126.2 million, an increase of 8.5% from the $116.3 million in the prior year's first quarter. Segment operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 16.8% for the first quarter 2012, compared to 17.1% for the first quarter of 2011. Segment operating margin decreased primarily because of $11.7 million of legacy environmental costs which was partially offset by improved price/material economics and productivity versus the same period last year. Excluding the impact from acquisitions and the legacy environmental reserves, segment operating margin expanded 150 basis points to 18.6%.
segment revenues for the first quarter of 2012 increased 9.2% to $651.9 million, compared with $596.9 million in the first quarter 2011. Core revenues were 3.7% higher than prior year, with acquisitions adding 5.7% and currency translation decreasing reported results by 0.2%. Core revenue growth was driven primarily by demand for energy efficient products and broad industrial demand, offset partially by the continued weak residential and nonresidential construction markets.
Electrical Products Group
Segment operating earnings were $92.4 million, an increase of 4.3% from the $88.6 million reported in the prior year's first quarter. Segment operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 14.2% for the first quarter of 2012, compared to a record first quarter of 14.8% for 2011. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, segment operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 15.0%.
 
Tools Joint Venture
Equity income from the Apex Tool Group joint venture is $14.3 million for the first quarter 2012, compared to equity income of $14.5 million in the first quarter of 2011.
Outlook
"For 2012, we are raising our guidance for earnings per share from continuing operations to a range of $4.25 to $4.40, up from $4.15 to $4.35, based on the stronger underlying demand in the industrial and utility markets and a book to bill ratio of 108%. This guidance assumes full-year total revenue growth of 6 to 8 percent and core revenue growth of 5 to 7 percent. For the second quarter of 2012 we expect earnings per share of $1.09 to $1.12 on total revenue growth of 6 to 8 percent. Investments made over the last several years in new product development, targeted verticals, and our increased presence in emerging markets have continued to strengthen our growth profile." said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kirk S. Hachigian. "Additionally, we are increasing our full year estimate for capital spending to a range of $160 to 180 million as a result of investments to support specific core growth opportunities in our Electronics and international Power Systems businesses."
