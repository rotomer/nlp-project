Exhibit 99.1
For Release: 9.00 a.m. Eastern, May 21, 2012
Not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in, into or from a Restricted Jurisdiction
CLEVELAND, OHIO and DUBLIN, IRELAND  (May 21, 2012)  Diversified industrial manufacturer Eaton Corporation (NYSE: ETN) ("Eaton") and electrical equipment supplier Cooper Industries plc (NYSE: CBE) ("Cooper") today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Eaton will acquire Cooper in a transaction that will significantly increase the capabilities and geographic breadth of the combined company's power management portfolio and electrical business.
Founded in 1833, Cooper is a leading supplier of electrical equipment with a wide range of electrical products including electrical protection, power transmission and distribution, lighting and wiring components. This suite of electrical products enhances customer energy efficiency and safety across a number of end markets globally.
Founded in 1911, Eaton is a global power management company. Its electrical business is a global leader in power distribution, power quality, control and automation, power monitoring, and energy management products and services. Eaton is positioned to answer today's most critical power management challenges through its electrical, aerospace, hydraulics and vehicle businesses.
At the close of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of 2012, Eaton and Cooper will be combined under a new company incorporated in Ireland, where Cooper is incorporated today. The newly created company, which is expected to be called Eaton Global Corporation Plc or a variant thereof ("New Eaton"), will be led by Alexander M. Cutler, Eaton's current chairman and chief executive officer.
"This compelling combination of Eaton's power distribution and power quality equipment and systems with Cooper's diversified component brands, global reach and international distribution creates a game changer to serve the electrical industry," said Cutler. "We're excited about bringing together two great companies to create shareholder value and continue our global growth. This combination significantly expands our ability to better serve our customers with their demands for critical energy saving technologies as they address the impact of the world's growing energy needs."
"We are extremely pleased to become part of Eaton's global electrical business," said Kirk Hachigian, chairman and chief executive officer of Cooper. "This combination creates endless opportunities to accelerate growth and serve our global customers through combining technology, distribution, penetrating important vertical industries and entering new emerging markets. The two companies are a perfect fit in every respect."
The combined company would have had historical 2011 revenues of $21.5 billion and EBITDA of $3.1 billion, and it is expected to enhance shareholder value by:
 
 
 
The Acquisition is expected to be accretive to operating earnings per share by $0.35 in 2014 and by $0.45 in 2015. Excluding the non-cash expense related to the amortization of intangibles arising from purchase accounting, the Acquisition is expected to be accretive to operating earnings per share by $0.65 in 2014 and by $0.75 in 2015
2
. The Acquisition will be financed with a mixture of cash, debt, and equity.
Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Cooper Shareholders will receive $39.15 in cash and 0.77479 shares of New Eaton for each Cooper share. Based on the Closing Price for Eaton common stock on Friday May 18, 2012, Cooper Shareholders will receive cash and shares valued at $72.00 per share, representing a premium of 29 percent and a total transaction equity value of approximately $11.8 billion
3
. Eaton Shareholders will receive one share of the new company for each share of Eaton that they own upon closing. The transaction will be taxable, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to both the Eaton Shareholders and the Cooper Shareholders.
Eaton Shareholders are expected to own approximately 73 percent of the combined company while legacy Cooper Shareholders are expected to own approximately 27 percent. Shares of New Eaton will be registered with the U.S. SEC and are expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ETN.
Eaton has secured a $6.75 billion fully underwritten bridge financing commitment from Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Citibank, N.A. to finance the cash portion of the Acquisition. Eaton plans to later refinance these bridge borrowings through a new term debt issuance, use of cash on hand, and the possible sale of assets.
A
PPROVALS
The combination is subject to the terms of a Transaction Agreement among Eaton, Cooper, New Eaton and certain other parties. The acquisition of Cooper by New Eaton will be effected by means of a "scheme of arrangement" under Irish law pursuant to which New Eaton will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Cooper from Cooper Shareholders for cash and shares (the "Acquisition"). The Acquisition will be subject to the terms and conditions to be set forth in the scheme of arrangement document to be delivered to Cooper Shareholders. To become effective, the scheme of arrangement will require, among other things, the approval of a majority in number of Cooper Shareholders, present and voting either in person or by proxy at a special Cooper Shareholder meeting, representing 75% or more in value of the Cooper shares held by such holders. Following the requisite Cooper Shareholder approval being obtained, the sanction of the Irish High court is also required. In addition, the Transaction Agreement must be adopted by shareholders holding two-thirds of the outstanding voting shares of Eaton in a special shareholder meeting. The Acquisition, which is unanimously recommended by the Boards of Directors of both companies, also is subject to receipt of certain regulatory approvals and certain other conditions, as more particularly set out in Appendix III to this announcement.

In providing its advice, Goldman Sachs has taken into account the commercial assessments of the Board of Cooper. Accordingly, the Board of Cooper unanimously recommends to Cooper Shareholders to vote in favour of the Acquisition and the Scheme, as the directors of Cooper who are Cooper Shareholders intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings.

THE
CQUISITION
The Cooper Board has on an ongoing basis discussed the long-term strategy of Cooper and strategic opportunities that might be available to enhance shareholder value, including additional investments in new growth opportunities, potential acquisitions, joint ventures and recapitalization options, as well as the possible sale of Cooper. Beginning in February 2012, senior management of Eaton and Cooper had a series of meetings regarding the possibility of an acquisition by Eaton of Cooper and the possible terms of such a transaction. In connection with a possible transaction, Cooper retained Goldman, Sachs & Co. as its financial advisor and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Arthur Cox as its legal advisors. During the months preceding the execution of definitive documentation for the Acquisition on May 21, 2012, the parties discussed and negotiated the transaction terms, conducted due diligence with respect to each other's businesses, consulted with the Panel, and Eaton arranged financing for the transaction. Also during this period, the Board of Cooper met, together with Cooper's senior management and its financial and legal advisors, on various occasions to consider the merits of a potential transaction with Eaton and the status of the discussions and negotiations between the parties. On May 18, 2012, the Cooper Board met, together with Cooper's senior management and financial and legal advisors, to consider proposed terms and drafts of definitive documentation for a proposed acquisition by Eaton of Cooper. At its meeting on May 20, 2012, Cooper's Board of Directors unanimously determined that the Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein, including the Scheme, were advisable for, fair to and in the best interests of Cooper and the Cooper Shareholders and declared advisable and determined that the terms of the Scheme were fair and reasonable.
In reaching its determination to approve the Acquisition, the Cooper Board consulted with and received advice and reports from management and its financial and legal advisors, and drew on its knowledge of Cooper's business, assets, financial position, operating results, historical and current trading and the opportunities and challenges in its businesses and their industries, as well as information relating to Eaton. After giving consideration to these and a variety of other factors and risks, the Cooper Board unanimously determined to recommend that Cooper Shareholders vote in favor of the Acquisition.

ECOMMENDATION
The Board of Cooper, which has been so advised by Goldman Sachs, considers the terms of the Acquisition to be fair and reasonable. In providing its advice, Goldman Sachs has taken into account the commercial assessments of the Board of Cooper. Accordingly, the Board of Cooper unanimously recommends to Cooper Shareholders to vote in favor of the Acquisition and the Scheme, as the directors of Cooper who are Cooper Shareholders intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings.

CQUISITION
AND
THE
CHEME
The Acquisition will be effected by way of a Scheme of Arrangement pursuant to Irish law. Under the Scheme (which will be subject to the Conditions set out in Appendix III to this announcement and which will also be set out in the Proxy Statement) Cooper Shareholders will receive the Consideration in return for the cancellation of the Cancellation Shares.
The Scheme of Arrangement is an arrangement made between Cooper and Cooper Shareholders under Section 201 of the Act and is subject to the approval of the Irish High Court. If the Scheme becomes effective, all Cancellation Shares will be cancelled pursuant to Sections 72 and 74 of the Act in accordance with the terms of the Scheme. Cooper will then issue new Cooper Shares to New Eaton in place of the Cancellation Shares cancelled pursuant to the Scheme and New Eaton will pay the Consideration for the Acquisition to former Cooper Shareholders. As a result of these arrangements, Cooper will become a wholly owned subsidiary of New Eaton.
To become effective, the Scheme requires, amongst other things, the approval at the Court Meeting of a majority in number of Cooper Shareholders, present and voting either in person or by proxy, representing three-fourths (75%) or more in value of the Cooper Shares held by such holders, as well as the approval by Cooper Shareholders of resolutions relating to the implementation of the Scheme at an EGM to be held directly after the Court Meeting.
Assuming the necessary approvals from the Cooper Shareholders have been obtained and all other conditions have been satisfied or (where applicable) waived, the Scheme will become effective upon delivery to the Registrar of Companies of a copy of the Court Order of the High Court sanctioning the Scheme together with the minute required by Section 75 of the Act confirming the capital reduction and registration of the Court Order and minute by the Registrar of Companies. Upon the Scheme becoming effective, it will be binding on all Cooper Shareholders, irrespective of whether or not they attended or voted at the Court Meeting or the EGM.
The Acquisition is conditional on the Scheme becoming effective. The Conditions to the Acquisition and the Scheme are set out in full in Appendix III to this announcement. The implementation of the Scheme is conditional, amongst other things, upon:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Proxy Statement, containing further information relating to the implementation of the Acquisition, the full terms and Conditions of the Scheme, and the notices of the Court Meeting to be convened by direction of the High Court, the separate Cooper Extraordinary General Meeting required to approve the Scheme and related resolutions and information relating to the convening of the Eaton Special Meeting will be posted as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this announcement, to Eaton Shareholders and to Cooper Shareholders.
The Proxy Statement will contain important information about the merger of Eaton with and into a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of New Eaton (with Eaton as the surviving corporation), the Acquisition (including the Scheme, which will be included within the Proxy Statement), the Transaction Agreement, the Eaton Special Meeting, the Court Meeting and the Cooper Extraordinary General Meeting. The Proxy Statement will also be a part of a registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC in order to register the New Eaton Shares pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. Upon a declaration of effectiveness by the SEC, the Proxy Statement will constitute a prospectus of New Eaton.

YNERGIES
Eaton believes the acquisition of Cooper will provide the potential for meaningful synergies over time and that there is a significant opportunity to realize expected pre-tax operating synergies of $375 million and global cash management and resultant tax benefits of $160 million annually by 2016
6
.
The expected sources of the expected annual synergies are:
 
 
 
Eaton believes that it will achieve the run-rate on these synergies by 2016. In particular, Eaton believes that it will achieve $260 million in cost-out synergies with over 90% complete by 2015. Total acquisition integration costs of approximately $200 million are expected to be incurred through 2015.
 
 
Subject to the Scheme becoming effective, Cooper Shareholders will be able to share in the synergies resulting from the acquisition of Cooper by Eaton through the share component of the Consideration.
Synergies and Integration Costs
 
The estimate of synergies set out in this document has been reported on for the purposes of the Takeover Rules by (i) Ernst & Young LLP; (ii) Citigroup Global Markets Limited; and (iii) Morgan Stanley & Co. Limited. Copies of their respective reports shall be mailed with the Proxy Statement. There are various material assumptions underlying the synergies estimate which might therefore be materially greater or less than estimated. The estimate of synergies should therefore be read in conjunction with Appendix I, which contains, among other information, certain key assumptions underlying the estimates.
Neither the statements above nor any other synergy statement in this announcement should be construed as a profit forecast or interpreted to mean that New Eaton's earnings in the first full year following the Acquisition, or in any subsequent period, would necessarily match or be greater than or be less than those of Eaton and/or Cooper for the relevant preceding financial period or any other period.

In accordance with the terms of the Cooper Industries plc 2011 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, each Cooper Option granted under such plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, whether or not then exercisable and vested, become fully exercisable and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and pursuant to the Scheme and without any action on the part of the holder of such Cooper Option, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Holdco the Scheme Consideration for each Net Cooper Share subject to such Cooper Option, less the Applicable Withholding Amount, within 7 calendar days following the Effective Date. The Applicable Withholding Amount covered under this Clause 4.1 shall first be applied to reduce the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holder's Cooper Option and, to the extent such Applicable Withholding Amount exceeds the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holder's Cooper Option, the excess of such Applicable Withholding Amount over the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holder's Cooper Option shall be applied to reduce the aggregate Share Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holder's Cooper Option (based on the Eaton Closing Price).
 
In accordance with the terms of the applicable plan governing such Cooper Option, each Cooper Option granted under the Cooper Industries plc Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated Cooper Industries plc Directors' Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall, whether or not then exercisable and vested, become fully exercisable and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and pursuant to the Scheme and without any action on the part of the holder of such Cooper Option, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the total number of Cooper Shares subject to such Cooper Option multiplied by (b) the excess, if any, of the Cash Out Amount over the exercise price per Cooper Share subject to such Cooper Option. Holdco shall pay to the holders of Cooper Options covered by this Clause 4.2, with respect to each Cooper Option covered by this Clause 4.2, the cash amount described in the immediately preceding sentence, less the Applicable Withholding Amount, within 7 calendar days following the Effective Date.
 
In accordance with the terms of the applicable plan governing such Cooper Share Award, each Cooper Share Award granted under the Cooper Employee Share Plans, other than any Cooper Share Award included in Deferral Accounts, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, whether or not then vested,
become fully vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and pursuant to the Scheme and without any action on the part of the holder of such Cooper Share Award, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Holdco, for each Cooper Share subject to such Cooper Share Award, the Scheme Consideration, less the Applicable Withholding Amount, within 7 calendar days following the Effective Date.
For any performance-based Cooper Share Award covered by this Clause 4.3, the number of Cooper Shares subject to such Cooper Share Award shall equal:
 
 
The Applicable Withholding Amount covered under this Clause 4.3 shall first be applied to reduce the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of a holder's Cooper Share Award and, to the extent such Applicable Withholding Amount exceeds the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holder's Cooper Share Award, the excess of such Applicable Withholding Amount over the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holder's Cooper Share Award shall be applied to reduce the aggregate Share Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holder's Cooper Share Award (based on the Eaton Closing Price).
 
In accordance with the terms of the applicable plan governing such Cooper Share Award, each Cooper Share Award (a) granted under the Cooper Director Share Plans or (b) included in a Deferral Account, in each case, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, whether or not then vested, become fully vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and pursuant to the Scheme and without any action on the part of the holder of such Cooper Share Award, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of Cooper Shares subject to such Cooper Share Award multiplied by (ii) the Cash Out Amount. Holdco shall pay to the holders of Cooper Share Awards covered by this Clause 4.4, with respect to each Cooper Share Award covered by this Clause 4.4, the cash amount described in the immediately preceding sentence, less the Applicable Withholding Amount, within 7 calendar days following the Effective Date.
 
Where holders of Cooper Share Awards are entitled to dividend equivalents under the Cooper Share Plans or any applicable award agreement, Holdco shall pay to such holders of Cooper Share Awards all dividend equivalents corresponding to such
Cooper Share Awards, less the Applicable Withholding Amount, within 7 calendar days following the Effective Date. Such payments will be made (a) in cash, with respect to dividend equivalents denominated in cash and (b) in the form of consideration (cash or Scheme Consideration) which mirrors the treatment of Cooper Share Awards under the applicable plan pursuant to which such dividend equivalents were issued as set forth in Clauses 4.1-4.4 hereof, with respect to dividend equivalents denominated in Cooper Shares.
 
 
 
 
Each of the Parties shall use reasonable endeavours to take any actions reasonably necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Clause 4, including, without limitation, having the applicable board or committee administering the plans governing the affected awards, adopt resolutions necessary to effect the foregoing.
 
Cooper shall procure that a special resolution be put before the Cooper Shareholders at the EGM proposing that the Articles of Association of Cooper be amended so that any Cooper Shares allotted following the EGM will either be subject to the terms of the Scheme or acquired by Holdco for the same consideration per Cooper Share as shall be payable to Cooper Shareholders under the Scheme (depending upon the timing of such allotment); provided, however that nothing in such amendment to the Articles of Association shall prohibit the sale (whether on a stock exchange or otherwise) of any Cooper Shares issued on the exercise of Cooper Options or vesting or settlement of Cooper Share Awards, as applicable, following the EGM but prior to the sanction of the Scheme by the High Court, it being always acknowledged that each and every Cooper Share will be bound by the terms of the Scheme.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Clause 4, no Fractional Entitlements shall be issued by Holdco under Clause 4.1 or Clause 4.3, and all Fractional Entitlements shall be aggregated and sold in the market with the net proceeds of any such sale distributed pro-rata to the holders of Cooper Share Awards.

Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Eaton Board, in response to an Intervening Event, from making an Eaton Change of Recommendation at any time prior to obtaining the Eaton Shareholder Approval if the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Notwithstanding any Eaton Change of Recommendation, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Clause 9, Eaton shall hold the Eaton Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Clause 3.7 for purposes of obtaining the Eaton Shareholder Approval, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Eaton of such obligation.
