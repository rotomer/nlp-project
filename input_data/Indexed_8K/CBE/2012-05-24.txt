Transaction Agreement and Conditions Appendix
On May 21, 2012, Cooper Industries plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of Ireland ("Cooper"), entered into a Transaction Agreement (the "Transaction Agreement") by and among Cooper, Eaton Corporation, an Ohio corporation ("Eaton"), Abeiron Limited, a private limited company organized under the laws of Ireland ("New Eaton"), Comdell Limited, a private limited company organized under the laws of Ireland and a wholly owned direct subsidiary of New Eaton ("Comdell"), Turlock B.V., a private company with limited liability organized under the laws of the Netherlands and a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Comdell ("Turlock B.V.") and Turlock Corporation, a corporation incorporated in Ohio and a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Turlock B.V. ("Turlock"). Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, (a) New Eaton will acquire Cooper (the "Acquisition") pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under Section 201, and a capital reduction under Sections 72 and 74, of the Irish Companies Act of 1963 (the "Scheme") and (b) Turlock will merge with and into Eaton, with Eaton as the surviving corporation in the merger (the "Merger" and, together with the Acquisition, the "Transactions"). As a result of the Transactions, both Eaton and Cooper will become wholly owned subsidiaries of New Eaton.
At the effective time of the Scheme, (a) Cooper shareholders will be entitled to receive $39.15 in cash and 0.77479 of a newly issued New Eaton ordinary share in exchange for each Cooper ordinary share held by such shareholders; and (b) Cooper equity awards will be treated in accordance with the terms of the applicable Cooper equity incentive plan as set forth in the Transaction Agreement, such that each Cooper share option and share-based award (and each dividend equivalent corresponding to such share based awards) that is outstanding (taking into account acceleration of vesting under the terms of the applicable Cooper equity incentive plan) will be cancelled and, in exchange, the holder thereof will receive in respect of each Cooper share underlying such award, either (i) the same number of New Eaton ordinary shares and cash as Cooper shareholders (less the aggregate exercise price in the case of options), or (ii) the equivalent cash value thereof, with such form of consideration determined by the applicable terms of the Cooper equity incentive plan, with all payments in respect of Cooper equity awards subject to applicable tax withholdings. Cash will be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of New Eaton. At the effective time of the Merger, (a) each share of Eaton common stock will be converted into the right to receive one New Eaton ordinary share; and (b) each Eaton share option, restricted share award and other Eaton share-based award that is outstanding will be converted into the right to receive an equity award from New Eaton, which award shall be subject to the same number of shares and the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Eaton award in respect of which it was issued. The effectiveness of the Merger is conditioned only upon the effectiveness of the Scheme.
The conditions to the implementation of the Transaction are set forth in Part B of Appendix III to the announcement (the "Rule 2.5 Announcement") issued by Cooper and Eaton pursuant to Rule 2.5 of the Irish Takeover Rules on May 21, 2012 (the "Conditions Appendix"). The implementation of the Transactions is conditional, among other things, upon:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, each party's obligation to effect the Acquisition is conditional, among other things, upon:
 
 
 
Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, effective as of the closing of the Transactions, the directors of New Eaton will be (i) the directors of Eaton as of immediately prior to the closing and (ii) two additional directors, who shall be members of the Cooper board of directors as of the date of the Transaction Agreement, which additional directors are to be selected by the governance committee of the Eaton board of directors.
The Transaction Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by Eaton and Cooper. Cooper has agreed, among other things, subject to certain exceptions, not to solicit any offer or proposal for specified alternative transactions, or to participate in discussions regarding such an offer or proposal with, or furnish any nonpublic information regarding such an offer or proposal to, any person that has made or, to Cooper's knowledge, is considering making such an offer or proposal. In addition, certain covenants require each of the parties to use, subject to the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement, all reasonable endeavours to cause the Transactions to be consummated. Subject to certain exceptions, the Transaction Agreement also requires each of Eaton and Cooper to call and hold shareholders' meetings and requires the boards of directors of Eaton and Cooper to recommend approval of the Transactions.
The Transaction Agreement contains certain customary termination rights, including, among others, (a) the right of either Cooper or Eaton to terminate the agreement if either party's shareholders fail to approve the Transactions, (b) the right of either Cooper or Eaton to terminate the Transaction Agreement if the board of directors of the other party changes its recommendation to approve the Transactions, (c) the right of Cooper to terminate the Transaction Agreement to enter into an agreement providing for a "Superior Proposal" as defined in the Transaction Agreement, (d) the right of either Cooper or Eaton to terminate the Transaction Agreement if the Scheme shall not have become effective by the date that is nine months after the date of the Transaction Agreement (the "End Date"), subject to certain conditions, provided that the End Date shall be extended by an additional three months in certain circumstances and (e) the right of either Cooper or Eaton to terminate the Transaction Agreement due to a material breach by the other party of any of its representations, warranties or covenants, subject to certain conditions. The Transaction Agreement also provides that if the Transaction Agreement is terminated (i) by Cooper following the board of directors of Eaton changing its recommendation to approve the Transactions (except in limited circumstances) or (ii) by Cooper or Eaton following the failure of the Eaton shareholders to approve the Transactions following the board of directors of Eaton changing its recommendation (except in limited circumstances), then Eaton shall pay to Cooper $300,000,000.
Expenses Reimbursement Agreement
In addition, on May 21, 2012, Eaton and Cooper entered into an Expenses Reimbursement Agreement ("ERA"), the terms of which have been approved by the Irish Takeover Panel. Under the ERA, Cooper has agreed to pay to Eaton the documented, specific and quantifiable third party costs and expenses incurred by Eaton in connection with the Acquisition upon the termination of the Transaction Agreement in certain specified circumstances. The maximum amount payable by Cooper to Eaton pursuant to the ERA is an amount equal to one percent of the aggregate value of the issued share capital of Cooper as ascribed by the terms of the Acquisition.
 
The foregoing description of the terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Conditions Appendix and the ERA are only summaries, and do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by the complete text of the Transaction Agreement, the Conditions Appendix and the ERA, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Note that the copy of the Transaction Agreement included in Part D of Appendix III to the copy of the Rule 2.5 Announcement furnished by Cooper as Exhibit 99.1 to its Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 21, 2012 contained incorrectly formatted clause numbering; the clause numbering in the copy of the Transaction Agreement filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto is correct. The documents attached hereto have been included to provide investors with information regarding their terms. The Transaction Agreement contains representations and warranties made by and to the parties thereto as of specific dates. The statements embodied in those representations and warranties were made for purposes of the contract between the parties and may be subject to qualifications and limitations agreed by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of that contract. In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to investors, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing matters as facts.
Rights Plan Amendment
In connection with the Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, on May 21, 2012, Cooper entered into Amendment No. 2 ("Amendment No. 2") to the Second Amended and Restated Rights Agreement by and among Cooper, Cooper Bermuda and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., dated September 8, 2009 (as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto dated September 2, 2011, the "Rights Agreement"), for the purpose of amending the Rights Agreement to render it inapplicable to the Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. In particular, Amendment No. 2 provides that (1) no person will be deemed to be an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) and no distribution of Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement) will occur solely by virtue of the approval, execution, delivery or performance of the Transaction Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, or the public announcement of any of the foregoing and (2) the Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement) will expire immediately prior to the effective time of the Scheme.
The foregoing description of the terms of Amendment No. 2 to the Rights Agreement is only a summary, and does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of Amendment No. 2 to the Rights Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The disclosure set forth under the heading "Rights Plan Amendment" in Item 1.01 of this Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.03.

In accordance with the terms of the Cooper Industries plc 2011 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, each Cooper Option granted under such plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, whether or not then exercisable and vested, become fully exercisable and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and pursuant to the Scheme and without any action on the part of the holder of such Cooper Option, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Holdco the Scheme Consideration for each Net Cooper Share subject to such Cooper Option, less the Applicable Withholding Amount, within 7 calendar days following the Effective Date. The Applicable Withholding Amount covered under this Clause 4.1 shall first be applied to reduce the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holder's Cooper Option and, to the extent such Applicable Withholding Amount exceeds the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holder's Cooper Option, the excess of such Applicable Withholding Amount over the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holder's Cooper Option shall be applied to reduce the aggregate Share Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holder's Cooper Option (based on the Eaton Closing Price).
 
In accordance with the terms of the applicable plan governing such Cooper Option, each Cooper Option granted under the Cooper Industries plc Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated Cooper Industries plc Directors' Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall, whether or not then exercisable and vested, become fully exercisable and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective
 
Time and pursuant to the Scheme and without any action on the part of the holder of such Cooper Option, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) the total number of Cooper Shares subject to such Cooper Option multiplied by (b) the excess, if any, of the Cash Out Amount over the exercise price per Cooper Share subject to such Cooper Option. Holdco shall pay to the holders of Cooper Options covered by this Clause 4.2, with respect to each Cooper Option covered by this Clause 4.2, the cash amount described in the immediately preceding sentence, less the Applicable Withholding Amount, within 7 calendar days following the Effective Date.
 
In accordance with the terms of the applicable plan governing such Cooper Share Award, each Cooper Share Award granted under the Cooper Employee Share Plans, other than any Cooper Share Award included in Deferral Accounts, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, whether or not then vested, become fully vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and pursuant to the Scheme and without any action on the part of the holder of such Cooper Share Award, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Holdco, for each Cooper Share subject to such Cooper Share Award, the Scheme Consideration, less the Applicable Withholding Amount, within 7 calendar days following the Effective Date.
For any performance-based Cooper Share Award covered by this Clause 4.3, the number of Cooper Shares subject to such Cooper Share Award shall equal:
 
 
The Applicable Withholding Amount covered under this Clause 4.3 shall first be applied to reduce the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of a holder's Cooper Share Award and, to the extent such Applicable Withholding Amount exceeds the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holder's Cooper Share Award, the excess of such Applicable Withholding Amount over the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holder's Cooper Share Award shall be applied to reduce the aggregate Share Consideration payable in respect of the cancellation of such holder's Cooper Share Award (based on the Eaton Closing Price).
 
In accordance with the terms of the applicable plan governing such Cooper Share Award, each Cooper Share Award (a) granted under the Cooper Director Share Plans
 
or (b) included in a Deferral Account, in each case, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, whether or not then vested, become fully vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and pursuant to the Scheme and without any action on the part of the holder of such Cooper Share Award, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of Cooper Shares subject to such Cooper Share Award multiplied by (ii) the Cash Out Amount. Holdco shall pay to the holders of Cooper Share Awards covered by this Clause 4.4, with respect to each Cooper Share Award covered by this Clause 4.4, the cash amount described in the immediately preceding sentence, less the Applicable Withholding Amount, within 7 calendar days following the Effective Date.
 
Where holders of Cooper Share Awards are entitled to dividend equivalents under the Cooper Share Plans or any applicable award agreement, Holdco shall pay to such holders of Cooper Share Awards all dividend equivalents corresponding to such Cooper Share Awards, less the Applicable Withholding Amount, within 7 calendar days following the Effective Date. Such payments will be made (a) in cash, with respect to dividend equivalents denominated in cash and (b) in the form of consideration (cash or Scheme Consideration) which mirrors the treatment of Cooper Share Awards under the applicable plan pursuant to which such dividend equivalents were issued as set forth in Clauses 4.1-4.4 hereof, with respect to dividend equivalents denominated in Cooper Shares.
 
 
 
 
Each of the Parties shall use reasonable endeavours to take any actions reasonably necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Clause 4, including, without limitation, having the applicable board or committee administering the plans governing the affected awards, adopt resolutions necessary to effect the foregoing.
 
Cooper shall procure that a special resolution be put before the Cooper Shareholders at the EGM proposing that the Articles of Association of Cooper be amended so that
 
any Cooper Shares allotted following the EGM will either be subject to the terms of the Scheme or acquired by Holdco for the same consideration per Cooper Share as shall be payable to Cooper Shareholders under the Scheme (depending upon the timing of such allotment); provided, however that nothing in such amendment to the Articles of Association shall prohibit the sale (whether on a stock exchange or otherwise) of any Cooper Shares issued on the exercise of Cooper Options or vesting or settlement of Cooper Share Awards, as applicable, following the EGM but prior to the sanction of the Scheme by the High Court, it being always acknowledged that each and every Cooper Share will be bound by the terms of the Scheme.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Clause 4, no Fractional Entitlements shall be issued by Holdco under Clause 4.1 or Clause 4.3, and all Fractional Entitlements shall be aggregated and sold in the market with the net proceeds of any such sale distributed pro-rata to the holders of Cooper Share Awards.

Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Eaton Board, in response to an Intervening Event, from making an Eaton Change of Recommendation at any time prior to obtaining the Eaton Shareholder Approval if the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Notwithstanding any Eaton Change of Recommendation, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Clause 9, Eaton shall hold the Eaton Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Clause 3.7 for purposes of obtaining the Eaton Shareholder Approval, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Eaton of such obligation.
