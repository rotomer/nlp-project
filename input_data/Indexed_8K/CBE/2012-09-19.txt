As previously announced, on May 21, 2012, Cooper Industries plc ("Cooper") and Eaton Corporation ("Eaton") entered into a transaction agreement, pursuant to which a holding company incorporated in Ireland that will be renamed Eaton Corporation plc ("New Eaton") will acquire Cooper pursuant to a "scheme of arrangement" under the Irish Companies Act of 1963 and Eaton pursuant to a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of New Eaton with and into Eaton (the acquisition and the merger, together, the "transaction"). The transaction was announced in an announcement (the "Announcement") pursuant to Rule 2.5 of the Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997, Takeover Rules, 2007 (as amended) (the "Irish Takeover Rules"). In connection with the transaction, New Eaton filed a registration statement on Form S-4, which was declared effective on September 7, 2012. The definitive joint proxy statement of Eaton and Cooper that also serves as a prospectus of New Eaton, and which forms a part of the Form S-4, was filed by each of Eaton, Cooper and New Eaton on September 14, 2012 (the "joint proxy statement/prospectus"). Cooper has commenced mailing to its shareholders the joint proxy statement/prospectus, together with the Profit Forecasts Document and the Merger Benefit Document (each as defined below). Eaton has also commenced mailing to its shareholders the joint proxy statement/prospectus.
Profit Forecasts Document
In accordance with the Irish Takeover Rules, where Eaton or Cooper give earnings guidance (known as a profit forecast under the Irish Takeover Rules), that profit forecast must be repeated in the proxy statement sent to Cooper shareholders and certain attestations to that profit forecast must also be provided. As both Eaton and Cooper have previously publicly disclosed profit forecasts for the financial year ending December 31, 2012, these profit forecasts have been repeated in the joint proxy statement/prospectus on pages 284 and 286 respectively, and also are repeated in a letter (the "Profit Forecasts Document") being mailed to Cooper shareholders with the joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition to such profit forecasts for Eaton and Cooper, the Profit Forecasts Document includes (1) reports from Eaton's auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, confirming that the Eaton profit forecast has been properly compiled on the basis of the assumptions set out in the profit forecast and the basis of accounting used is consistent with the accounting policies of Eaton, and Eaton's financial advisors, Morgan Stanley & Co. Limited and Citigroup Global Markets Limited, confirming that they consider that the Eaton profit forecast has been made with due care and consideration, each prepared solely for the purposes of complying with Rule 28.3 of the Irish Takeover Rules, and (2) reports from Cooper's auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, confirming that the Cooper profit forecast has been properly compiled on the basis of the assumptions made by the directors of Cooper and the basis of accounting used is consistent with the accounting policies of Cooper, and Cooper's financial advisor, Goldman, Sachs & Co., confirming that it considers that the Cooper profit forecast has been made with due care and consideration, each prepared solely for the purposes of complying with Rule 28.3 of the Irish Takeover Rules.
The Profit Forecasts Document is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
Merger Benefit Document
In accordance with the Irish Takeover Rules, where Eaton gives a statement regarding the synergies that may result from the transaction (known as a merger benefit statement under the Irish Takeover Rules), certain attestations to that merger benefit statement must be provided. As Eaton previously disclosed a merger benefit statement in the Announcement, that statement has been repeated in the joint proxy statement/prospectus on pages 288 through 290, and is also repeated in a letter (the "Merger Benefit Document") being mailed to Cooper shareholders with the joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition to such merger benefit statement, the Merger Benefit Document includes reports from Eaton's auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, and Eaton's financial advisors, Morgan Stanley & Co. Limited and Citigroup Global Markets Limited, confirming (respectively) that the merger benefit statements have been made with due care and consideration.

Profit Forecast including Bases and Assumptions
1.
General
Eaton Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, referred to herein as the "Group") made the following public statement on July 23, 2012 within its second quarter earnings release:
"Absent any impact from the completion of the Cooper transaction, our guidance for operating earnings per share, which exclude charges to integrate our recent acquisitions, is between $4.20 and $4.50 and for net income per share is between $4.09 and $4.39."
Operating earnings per share is defined as net income per share, adjusted to exclude acquisition integration charges, divided by weighted average diluted shares. Weighted average diluted shares is calculated by adding incremental shares from assumed conversions of stock options, net of assumed share repurchases, and restricted stock awards to the weighted average basic shares outstanding.
The statement above regarding operating earnings per share and net income per share for the year ending December 31, 2012 constitutes a profit forecast ("") for the purposes of Rule 28 of the Irish Takeover Rules (Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997 Takeover Rules, 2007).
Eaton Profit Forecast
2. Basis of preparation
The Eaton Profit Forecast has been prepared on a basis consistent with the accounting policies adopted by Eaton which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and those adopted in the preparation of the interim financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2012, and those expected to be adopted in the financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2012.
The Eaton Profit Forecast was based on the interim unaudited accounts for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and a forecast for the six months ending December 31, 2012 and on the basis that the proposed acquisition of Cooper Industries plc does not complete before December 31, 2012 and excludes any costs related to the completion of the acquisition.
Eaton does not expect the Eaton Profit Forecast to be materially impacted by acquisitions or disposals of businesses not previously disclosed.
3. Assumptions
The Eaton Directors have approved the Eaton Profit Forecast on the basis of the following assumptions:
Specific assumptions adopted by the Eaton Directors
 -  End markets and hence sales earned by Eaton will grow over the levels achieved in 2011 overall by 3.5% for all of 2012. The assumed end market growth by segment follows:
 
 -  Sales growth will exceed the end market growth forecast by 40% or $225 million during 2012.
 -  Total segment operating margins for 2012 will be between 14.5% and 15.0%, and incremental margin will be 29%.
 -  There will be no material share repurchases, or issuances, in determining weighted average number of diluted shares.
Factors outside the influence or control of the Eaton Directors
 -  There will be no changes beyond what has already been contemplated, in general trading conditions, economic conditions, competitive environment or levels of demand, in the countries in which Eaton operates or trades which would materially affect Eaton's business.
 -  There will be no material cancellations in respect of orders currently placed with Eaton.
 -  There will be no business interruptions that materially affect Eaton, its major suppliers or major customers by reason of technological faults, natural disasters, industrial disruption, civil disturbance or government action.
 -  There will be no material changes in the price of raw materials, freight, energy, and labor costs.
 -  There will be no changes in exchange rates, interest rates, bases of taxes, legislative or regulatory requirements that would have a material impact on Eaton.
 
 
Dear Sirs
We refer to the profit forecast comprising the statements made by Eaton Corporation (the "Company") in respect of the operating earnings per share and net income per share, for the year ending December 31, 2012 (the "") set out in the Company's Q2 earnings announcement dated 23 July 2012. The bases and assumptions upon which the Profit Forecast is based are set out in the appendix hereto.

Responsibilities
It is the responsibility of the directors of the Company ("the Directors") to prepare the Profit Forecast in accordance with the requirements of the Rules.
It is our responsibility to form an opinion as required by the Rules as to the proper compilation of the Profit Forecast and to report that opinion to you.
Save for any responsibility that we may have to those persons to whom this report is expressly addressed, to the fullest extent permitted by law we do not assume any responsibility and will not accept any liability to any other person for any loss suffered by any such other person as a result of, arising out of, or in connection with, this report.
Basis of preparation of the Profit Forecast
The Profit Forecast has been prepared on the basis stated within the Report and is based on the unaudited interim financial results for the six months ended 30 June 2012, the unaudited management accounts for the six months
ended 30 June 2012 and a forecast to 31 December 2012. The Profit Forecast is required to be presented on a basis consistent with the accounting policies of the Group.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our work in accordance with Standards for Investment Reporting issued by the Auditing Practices Board in the United Kingdom. Our work included evaluating the basis on which the historical financial information included in the Profit Forecast has been prepared and considering whether the Profit Forecast has been accurately computed based upon the disclosed assumptions and the accounting policies of the Group. Whilst the assumptions upon which the Profit Forecast are based (the "Assumptions") are solely the responsibility of the Directors, we considered whether anything came to our attention to indicate that any of the Assumptions, which, in our opinion, are necessary for a proper understanding of the Profit Forecast have not been disclosed or if any material Assumption appears to us to be unrealistic.
We planned and performed our work so as to obtain the information and explanations we considered necessary in order to provide us with reasonable assurance that the Profit Forecast has been properly compiled on the basis stated.
Since the Profit Forecast and the Assumptions on which it is based relate to the future and may therefore be affected by unforeseen events, we can express no opinion as to whether the actual results reported will correspond to those shown in the Profit Forecast and differences may be material.
Our work has not been carried out in accordance with auditing or other standards and practices generally accepted in the United States of America or other jurisdictions and accordingly should not be relied upon as if it had been carried out in accordance with those standards and practices.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Profit Forecast has been properly compiled on the basis of the Assumptions as set within the Report and the basis of accounting used is consistent with the accounting policies of the Group.

Dear Sirs
We report on the profit forecast comprising the earnings per share from continuing operations ("EPS") of Cooper Industries plc (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (together the "Group") for the year ending 31 December 2012 (the "Profit Forecast"). The Profit Forecast, and the material assumptions upon which it is based, are set out on pages 286 to 287 of the Scheme Document (the "Document") issued by the Company dated 14 September 2012. This report is required by Rule 28.3(a) of the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997, Takeover Rules 2007 (as amended) (the "Rules") and is given for the purpose of complying with that rule and for no other purpose.
Accordingly we assume no responsibility in respect of this report to the Offeror or any person connected to, or acting on concert with, the Offeror or to any other person who is seeking or may in future seek to acquire control of the Company (an "Alternative Offeror") or to any other person connected to, or acting in concert with, an Alternative Offeror.
Responsibilities
It is the responsibility of the directors of the Company ("the Directors") to prepare the Profit Forecast in accordance with the requirements of the Rules.
It is our responsibility to form an opinion as required by the Rules as to the proper compilation of the Profit Forecast and to report that opinion to you.
Basis of preparation of the Profit Forecast
The Profit Forecast has been prepared on the basis stated on page 286 of the Scheme Document and is based on the unaudited interim financial results for the three months ended 31 March 2012, the unaudited management accounts for the nine months ended 31 December 2012 and a forecast to 31 December 2012. The Profit Forecast is required to be presented on a basis consistent with the accounting policies of the Group.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our work in accordance with Standards for Investment Reporting issued by the Auditing Practices Board in the United Kingdom. Our work included evaluating the basis on which the historical financial information included in the Profit Forecast has been prepared and considering whether the Profit Forecast has been accurately computed based upon the disclosed assumptions and the accounting policies of the Group. Whilst the assumptions upon which the Profit Forecast are based are solely the responsibility of the Directors, we considered whether anything came to our attention to indicate that any of the assumptions adopted by the
Directors which, in our opinion, are necessary for a proper understanding of the Profit Forecast have not been disclosed or if any material assumption made by the Directors appears to us to be unrealistic.
We planned and performed our work so as to obtain the information and explanations we considered necessary in order to provide us with reasonable assurance that the Profit Forecast has been properly compiled on the basis stated.
Since the Profit Forecast and the assumptions on which it is based relate to the future and may therefore be affected by unforeseen events, we can express no opinion as to whether the actual results reported will correspond to those shown in the Profit Forecast and differences may be material.
Our work has not been carried out in accordance with auditing or other standards and practices generally accepted in the United States of America or other jurisdictions and accordingly should not be relied upon as if it had been carried out in accordance with those standards and practices.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Profit Forecast has been properly compiled on the basis of the assumptions made by the Directors and the basis of accounting used is consistent with the accounting policies of the Group.

Exhibit 99.2
 
September 19, 2012
Dear Cooper Shareholder,
On May 21, 2012, Eaton Corporation ("Eaton") and Cooper Industries plc ("Cooper") announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Eaton Corporation Limited (through the formation of a new holding company incorporated in Ireland that will be renamed Eaton Corporation plc) ("New Eaton") will acquire Cooper and Eaton (the "Transaction"). On September 6, 2012, New Eaton filed with the SEC Amendment No. 4 to its registration statement on Form S-4 in connection with the Transaction, which was declared effective on September 7, 2012. The definitive joint proxy statement of Eaton and Cooper that also serves as the prospectus of New Eaton, and which forms a part of the Form S-4, was filed by each of Eaton, Cooper and New Eaton on September 14, 2012 (the "Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is included along with this letter.
As Cooper is an Irish incorporated company, the Transaction is subject to the Irish Takeover Rules. In accordance with the Irish Takeover Rules, where Eaton gives a statement regarding the synergies that may result from the Transaction (known as a merger benefit statement under the Irish Takeover Rules), certain attestations to that merger benefit statement must be provided.
As Eaton previously disclosed a merger benefit statement in the announcement of the Transaction on May 21, 2012, that statement has been repeated in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus on pages 288 through 290, and is also repeated in this letter.
In addition, included with this letter are reports from Eaton's auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, and Eaton's financial advisors, Morgan Stanley & Co. Limited and Citigroup Global Markets Limited, confirming (respectively) that the merger benefit statements have been made with due care and consideration.
Very truly yours,

These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include adverse regulatory decisions; failure to satisfy other closing conditions with respect to the Transaction; the risks that the new businesses will not be integrated successfully or that we will not realize estimated cost savings and synergies; our ability to refinance the bridge loan on favorable terms and maintain our current long-term credit rating; unanticipated changes in the markets for our business segments; unanticipated downturns in business relationships with customers or their purchases from Eaton; competitive pressures on our sales and pricing; increases in the cost of material, energy and other production costs, or unexpected costs that cannot be recouped in product pricing; the introduction of competing technologies; unexpected technical or marketing difficulties; unexpected claims, charges, litigation or dispute resolutions; new laws and governmental regulations.

Cooper Safe Harbor Statement
This communication may contain forward-looking statements concerning the Transaction, our long-term credit rating and our revenues and operating earnings. These statements or disclosures may discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future trends, plans, events, results of operations or financial condition, or state other information relating to Cooper, based on current beliefs of management as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. Forward-looking statements generally will be accompanied by words such as "anticipate," "believe," "could," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "guidance," "intend," "may," "possible," "potential," "predict," "project" or other similar words, phrases or expressions. These statements should be used with caution. They are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include adverse regulatory decisions; failure to satisfy other closing conditions with respect to the Transaction; the risks that the new businesses will not be integrated successfully or that we will not realize estimated cost savings and synergies; unanticipated changes in the markets for our business segments; unanticipated downturns in business relationships with customers or their purchases from Cooper; competitive pressures on our sales and pricing; increases in the cost of material, energy and other production costs, or unexpected costs that cannot be recouped in product pricing; the introduction of competing technologies; unexpected technical or marketing difficulties; unexpected claims, charges, litigation or dispute resolutions; new laws and governmental regulations, including changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
Eaton believes the acquisition of Cooper will provide the potential for meaningful synergies over time and that there is a significant opportunity to realize expected pre-tax operating synergies of $375 million and global cash management and resultant tax benefits of $160 million annually by 2016.
The expected sources of the expected annual synergies are:
 
 
 
Eaton believes that it will achieve the run-rate on these synergies by 2016. In particular, Eaton believes that it will achieve $260 million in cost-out synergies with over 90% complete by 2015. Total acquisition integration costs of approximately $200 million are expected to be incurred through 2015.
Subject to the Scheme becoming effective, Cooper Shareholders will be able to share in the synergies resulting from the acquisition of Cooper by Eaton through the share component of the scheme consideration.
Synergies and Integration Costs
 
The estimate of synergies set out in this document has been reported on for the purposes of Rule 19.3(b)(ii) Takeover Rules by (i) Ernst & Young LLP; (ii) Citigroup Global Markets Limited; and (iii) Morgan Stanley & Co. Limited.
Copies of their respective reports are being mailed with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
There are various material assumptions underlying the synergies estimate which might therefore be materially greater or less than estimated. The estimate of synergies should therefore be read in conjunction with the key assumptions underlying the estimates.
The synergy statements should not be construed as a profit forecast or interpreted to mean that New Eaton's earnings in the first full year following the acquisition, or in any subsequent period, would necessarily match or be greater than or be less than those of Eaton and/or Cooper for the relevant preceding financial period or any other period.
