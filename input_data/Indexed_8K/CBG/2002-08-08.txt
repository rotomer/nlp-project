This Current Report on Form 8-K is filed by CBRE Holding, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the matters described herin.
 
Item 4.  Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.
 
The Company has elected to engage the services of Deloitte & Touche LLP as its new independent auditors replacing Arthur Andersen LLP ("Andersen").  The client-auditor relationship between the Company and Andersen ceased on April 23, 2002 as noted in the Company's 8-K filed on April 25, 2002.
 
The hiring of Deloitte & Touche became effective on June 10, 2002 following the Company's decision to seek proposals from independent auditors to audit the financial statements of the Company, and was approved by the Company's Board of Directors upon the recommendation of its Audit Committee.  Deloitte and Touche will audit the financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002.
 
During the two most recent fiscal years of the Company and CB Richard Ellis Services, Inc., its predecessor company, and the interim period through June 10, 2002, neither the Company nor its predecessor consulted with Deloitte & Touche regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a) (2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
