EBITDA is calculated as follows:
 
 
EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets relating to acquisitions.  Management believes that the presentation of EBITDA will enhance a reader's understanding of the Company's operating performance.  EBITDA is also a measure used by senior management to evaluate the performance of the Company's various lines of business and for other required or discretionary purposes, such as the use of EBITDA as a significant component when measuring performance under the Company's employee incentive programs.  Additionally, many of the Company's debt covenants are based upon a measure similar to EBITDA.  EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to (i) operating income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or (ii) operating cash flow determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The Company's calculation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
