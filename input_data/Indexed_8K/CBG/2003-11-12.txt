FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
Los Angeles, CA - (November 12, 2003)  CBRE Holding, Inc., parent corporation of CB Richard Ellis Services, Inc., the world's leading real estate services firm, today reported its results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2003.
 
Third quarter 2003 results include the activities of Insignia Financial Group, Inc. (Insignia Acquisition) from July 23, 2003 (the effective date of the merger) through the end of the quarter. The combined company results have been significantly impacted by costs associated with the merger, as noted below.
 
Revenue totaled $423.4 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003, an increase of $138.4 million or 48.6% as compared to $284.9 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2002.  Net loss totaled $28.4 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003 versus net income of $1.9 million for the same period last year. The net loss in the current period was mainly driven by $31.3 million of amortization expense resulting from intangible assets acquired as part of the Insignia Acquisition as well as merger-related charges of $16.5 million associated with the Insignia Acquisition. The intangible asset amortization primarily pertains to the revenue backlog acquired in the Insignia transaction. Net income cannot be recognized from purchased backlog; hence this amortization expense offsets that portion of operating income that was generated from the Insignia backlog acquired. Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) totaled $20.7 million for the third quarter ended September 30,
 
 
2003, a decrease of $6.9 million or 24.9% from last year's same period results.  This decrease was mainly driven by the above-mentioned $16.5 million of merger-related charges.
 
Revenue totaled $1.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, which represents a $215.0 million or 27.1% increase over $793.8 million of revenue generated in the same period last year.  Net loss totaled $24.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 versus net income of $3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002.  The net loss in the current year was mainly due to the previously mentioned total of $47.8 million of amortization expense and merger-related charges incurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2003. EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 was $69.4 million, a $2.6 million or 3.5% decrease from last year's same period results.  This decrease was primarily caused by the $19.8 million of merger-related costs associated with the Insignia Acquisition that were incurred during this period.
 
2003, at 7:00 a.m. Pacific time, the Company will hold a conference call with its bondholders to discuss its results for the quarter ended September 30, 2003.

EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Management believes that the presentation of EBITDA will enhance a reader's understanding of the Company's operating performance.  EBITDA is also a measure used by senior management to evaluate the performance of the Company's various lines of business and for other required or discretionary purposes, such  as the use of EBITDA as a significant component when measuring performance under the Company's employee incentive programs.  Additionally, many of the Company's debt covenants are based upon a measure similar to EBITDA.  EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to (i) operating income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or (ii) operating cash flow determined in accordance with  accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The Company's calculation of EBITDA may not be comparable to  similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
