FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Los Angeles, CA - (May 17, 2004)  CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc., parent corporation of CB Richard Ellis Services, Inc., the world's largest commercial real estate services firm (based on 2003 revenue), today filed its report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2004.  The financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2004 contained in the Form 10-Q differs from the financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2004 contained in the Company's press release issued on May 6, 2004 as a result of the Company's refinement of the purchase price allocation related to its acquisition of Insignia Financial Group, Inc. ("Insignia") on July 23, 2003.  The Company has revised the estimated fair value assigned to the broker draw asset acquired from Insignia.  This has resulted in adjustments to the balance sheet, including a net decrease in goodwill of $3.8 million, a decrease of $1.4 million in stockholders' equity, an increase of $1.3 million in other current assets and an increase in net other assets of $1.1 million.  Additionally, the Company has recorded an adjustment for the amortization of this broker draw asset on a cumulative basis during the quarter ended March 31, 2004, which has resulted in adjustments to the statement of operations, including increases of $2.2 million in both cost of services and operating loss, as well as an increase in net loss of $1.4 million.
