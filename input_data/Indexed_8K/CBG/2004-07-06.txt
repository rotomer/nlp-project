On June 10, 2004 CB Richard Ellis Group raised approximately $138 million of net proceeds in an initial public offering of Class A Common Shares.  The offering totaled 24.0 million shares at a price of $19.00 per share, with 7.7 million shares offered by the Company and 16.3 million shares offered by selling stockholders.  At the time of the offering, the Company said it would use the net proceeds to decrease its leverage and redeem a portion of its high interest debt.
 
Ray Wirta, Chief Executive Officer of CB Richard Ellis Group commented, "The net proceeds from the initial public offering as well as the cash generated by our diversified real estate services platform has provided us with the necessary capital to strengthen our balance sheet and achieve a significant ongoing reduction in interest expense of
approximately $14 million.  The Company's intention is to continue to pay down debt with cash flow generated from operations."
 
Mr. Wirta continued, "With the pay down of debt, we have greatly improved the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios."
