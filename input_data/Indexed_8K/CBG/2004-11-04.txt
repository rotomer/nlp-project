FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Los Angeles, CA - November 3, 2004  CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today reported revenue of $575.0 million and net income of $11.9 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2004.  For the same period last year, the Company reported revenue of $423.4 million and a net loss of $28.4 million, or $0.49 net loss per diluted share.

.
Total revenue increased 35.8% to $575.0 million compared with $423.4 million for the third quarter of 2003.  Generally improved U.S. economic conditions coupled with market share gains fueled organic revenue growth of approximately 24% as sales, leasing and consulting fees rose sharply from the year-earlier quarter.  Additionally, revenue growth was aided by full-quarter contributions from the Insignia acquisition()

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) totaled $61.8 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2004, an increase of $41.1 million, or
198.6%, from the same period last year.  The increase was driven primarily by strong revenue growth as well as lower merger-related costs, which significantly impacted third quarter 2003 results.  The third quarter of 2004 reflected final merger-related costs of $4.0 million primarily related to a facility vacated during the quarter.
 
Interest Expense and Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
In line with the Company's strategy to reduce debt, in July of 2004 the Company used the remaining net proceeds received from its initial public offering to pay down a portion of its high interest rate debt, including $70.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 9% senior notes due 2010 and $38.3 million in aggregate principal amount of its 16% senior notes due 2011.  Premium costs associated with the repayments as well as the related write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized discount resulted in a $17.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the current quarter. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company incurred a $6.8 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with a prior credit facility, which was replaced in conjunction with the Insignia acquisition.
 
Interest expense totaled $14.9 million for the current year quarter, a decrease of $6.1 million, or 29.0%, compared to the same period last year.  The decrease was driven by the interest savings as a result of debt repayments during the fourth quarter of 2003 and throughout 2004.  The Company expects to achieve annual cash interest savings in 2005 of approximately $16.0 million as a result of its de-leveraging efforts in 2004.
 
Management's Commentary
 "Our third quarter results demonstrate the power of our global real estate services platform and validate our growth strategy," said Ray Wirta, chief executive officer of CB Richard Ellis.
 
"Our strong performance was fueled by double-digit organic revenue growth, improved market fundamentals in the U.S. and overseas and the Insignia acquisition.  U.S. investment activity remains at record levels, despite modestly higher interest rates, as more capital sources are attracted to real estate.  We have captured a market-leading share of this investment activity.  U.S. office leasing markets continue to recover steadily, with positive absorption and falling vacancy levels becoming the norm in many large cities.  Demand for office space has been on a definite upswing as business confidence has been restored.
 
"In Europe, we have benefited from the recovery of major office markets, as well as the robust investment market, particularly in London and Paris where we hold significant market share following the Insignia acquisition.  Absorption of office space has picked up sharply in London and this has historically been a leading indicator for office markets across the region.  In Asia Pacific, we have achieved notable market share gains, supported by an improved economic and market climate and the strength of our global platform.
"Historically, the fourth quarter is our strongest period and we have particularly good momentum going into it this year," Mr. Wirta added.
 
Americas Region
Third quarter revenue for the Americas region, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and South America, increased 31.0% to $425.2 million, compared with $324.5 million for the third quarter of 2003.  This increase was primarily related to stronger sales, leasing and consulting activity in the U.S. coupled with incremental contributions from Insignia. Organic revenue growth in the Americas region was approximately 25% in the quarter.
 
Operating income for the Americas region totaled $35.8 million for the third quarter of 2004, compared with an operating loss of $11.9 million for the third quarter of 2003.  The $47.7 million increase was primarily driven by the aforementioned revenue growth as well as lower amortization expense related to Insignia net revenue backlog(4) and lower merger-related costs incurred in the current quarter.  Excluding the impact of all one-time items, operating income for this region would have been $44.5 million for the third quarter of 2004, an increase of $18.8 million, or 73.0%, as compared to the third quarter of last year.  The Americas region's EBITDA totaled $49.2 million for the third quarter of 2004, an increase of $30.5 million from last year's third quarter.
 
Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) Region
Revenue for the EMEA region, mainly consisting of operations in Europe, increased 58.5% to $110.0 million for the third quarter of 2004, compared with $69.4 million for the third quarter of 2003.  Organic revenue growth in the EMEA region was approximately 20% in the quarter.  Operating income for the EMEA region totaled $4.6 million for the current quarter, compared with an operating loss of $13.8 million for the same quarter last year.  Excluding one-time items, operating income for this region would have been $5.5 million, which represents an increase of $6.1 million as compared to the third quarter of 2003.  EBITDA for the EMEA region totaled $6.6 million for the third quarter of 2004, an increase of $8.7 million from last year's same period results.  The year-over-year improvement primarily reflects organic growth, particularly in London, as well as contributions from the Insignia operations.
 
Asia Pacific Region
In the Asia Pacific region, which includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, revenue totaled $39.8 million for the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 35% (all organic) from $29.5 million for the third quarter of 2003.  Operating income for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $4.2 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2004, compared with $3.1 million for the same period last year. EBITDA for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $6.1 million for the third quarter of 2004, an increase of $2.0 million from last year's same period results. The improved results reflect the Company's success in increasing market share in Australia and Japan.  The Asia Pacific segment did not incur any one-time costs associated with the Insignia acquisition or the initial public
offering.
 
Business Line Performance
CB Richard Ellis' business lines enter the fourth quarter, historically the Company's strongest, with good momentum.  During the third quarter of 2004, the Company has gained a number of corporate clients, including General Motors, Pfizer, Regions Bank and renewed a 14-year relationship with Kodak.  CBRE/L.J. Melody, the Company's mortgage brokerage business, is expected to achieve new record volume this year with mortgage originations totaling $8.9 billion through the third quarter, which is 28% ahead of 2003's pace.  The investment management business completed $900 million of transactions in the third quarter. Assets under management now exceed approximately $15.0 billion and continued asset growth is expected.  The Company's valuation business, which it believes is the world's largest, is also on track for a record year.
 
Nine-month Results
Nine-month revenue increased 55.3% to $1.6 billion, compared with the same period last year.  Organic revenue growth was approximately 18% for the nine months.  The Company posted a net loss of $1.7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 compared with a net loss of $24.6 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the same period last year.
 
, or $0.71 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2004.  This represents an increase of $40.5 million, approximately 450%, or $0.52 per diluted share, as compared with the same period in 2003.
Excluding one-time items, the Company would have earned net income of $49.5 million(1)
 
EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 was $110.9 million, representing an increase of $41.4 million, or 59.7%, from last year's same period, despite the inclusion of $52.3 million of merger-related charges, integration costs and one-time compensation expense in the current year versus only $23.2 million of merger-related and integration charges in the prior year.
 
2004 Guidance
The Company expects to achieve full year revenue of approximately $2.2 billion.  The Company has revised its full year earnings guidance and expects to achieve diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.76 to $0.81.
 
The Company has also revised its estimate of  full year 2004 one-time costs to be approximately $85 million (or $53 million after-tax), comprised of:
 
$13 million (or $8 million after-tax) of intangible asset amortization expense related to Insignia net revenue backlog;
 - 
                 
$40 million (or $25 million after-tax) of Insignia merger and integration related costs;
 - 
                 
$15 million (or $9 million after-tax) of one-time compensation expense; and
 - 
                 
$17 million (or $11 million after-tax) of one-time premium costs and write-offs associated with the repayment of debt with the net proceeds from the initial public offering.
 - 
                 
 
Excluding these one-time items, the Company anticipates full year 2004 diluted earnings per share will be in the range of $1.50 to $1.55 per share.

The operating results for 2004 include the operations of Insignia.  However, the operating results from January 1 to July 23, 2003 do not include the operations of Insignia, as the Insignia acquisition occurred on July 23, 2003.  As such, our consolidated financial statements after the Insignia acquisition are not directly comparable to our consolidated financial statements prior to the Insignia acquisition.

() The Company's management believes that EBITDA is useful in evaluating its performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.  As a result, the Company's management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the performance of various business lines and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring its performance under its employee incentive programs.
3
 
However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and when analyzing the Company's operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, operating income (loss) and net income (loss), each as determined in accordance with GAAP.  Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.  The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
 
For a reconciliation of EBITDA with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
 
(4) The intangible asset amortization pertains to the net revenue backlog acquired in the Insignia transaction.  Net income cannot be recognized from purchased backlog; hence this amortization expense offsets that portion of operating income that was generated from the Insignia backlog acquired.
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The following measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC guidelines:
 
Net income, as adjusted for one-time items
(i)
                                    
 
Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted for one-time items

EBITDA
(iii)
                              
 
Operating income, as adjusted for one-time items
(iv)
                             
 
The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of current results to prior periods as well as presenting the effects of one-time items in all periods presented.  The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of one-time items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of its business.
Net income, as adjusted for one-time items and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted for one-time items are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands): 
 
 
With adjustments to arrive at "Net income, as adjusted," a net loss translates into a net income position on an  adjusted basis.  Accordingly, the weighted average impact of the dilutive effect of potential common shares of  938,383, 3,657,668 and 843,090 have been considered in determining the dilutive earnings per share on a adjusted  basis for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 2003,  respectively.
