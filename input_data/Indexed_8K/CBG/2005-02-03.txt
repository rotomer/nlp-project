FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Los Angeles, CA - February 2, 2005  CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today reported full year 2004 diluted earnings per share of $0.91, or $1.65 excluding one-time items related to the Insignia acquisition and the Company's initial public offering.  Based on the momentum exhibited by all of its business lines, the Company is revising its diluted earnings per share guidance upward for 2005 to a range of $1.95 to $2.05, excluding residual one-time Insignia-related and debt buy-back charges.
 
Fourth Quarter Highlights
 
For the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company generated revenue of $798.2 million, which was 28.5% ahead of the $621.3 million posted in the fourth quarter of 2003.  The Company reported fourth quarter net income of $66.4 million, or $0.88 per diluted share.  This was $76.5 million ahead of the fourth quarter of 2003, when the Company reported a net loss of $10.1 million, or $0.16 net loss per diluted share.
 
net income(1)of $68.4 million, or $0.90 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with $27.9 million of net income, or $0.44 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003.  This constitutes an increase in net income, as adjusted, of 145.5%.
Excluding one-time items primarily related to the July 2003 acquisition of Insignia Financial Group, the Company would have earned
Revenue
 
The above-mentioned revenue increase of 28.5% for the fourth quarter of 2004 resulted from organic revenue growth fueled by strong investment property sales and improving leasing market fundamentals on a global basis.
 
EBITDA
(2)
 
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) totaled $134.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $71.1 million, or 112.2%, from the same period last year.  The increase was primarily driven by strong revenue growth combined with improved operating margins and the absence of Insignia merger-related costs in the current quarter, which significantly impacted fourth quarter 2003 results.
 
Interest Expense
 
Interest expense totaled $13.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, a decrease of $6.2 million, or 32.0%, compared with the same period last year.  The decrease was driven by the interest savings realized from the repayments of higher interest debt starting in the fourth quarter of 2003 and continuing throughout 2004.  The Company expects to achieve annual cash interest savings of approximately $16.0 million as a result of its de-leveraging efforts totaling approximately $150.0 million in 2004.
 
Management's Commentary
 
"Our fourth quarter results exceeded expectations," said Ray Wirta, chief executive officer of CB Richard Ellis. "Year-end business activity was exceptionally strong and we enter 2005 with good momentum.  All of our business lines are performing well, led by continued strong investment sales and higher leasing revenues.
 
"Historically low interest rates continue to drive capital flows into real estate and commercial properties are trading hands at a strong pace.  Leasing fundamentals have improved as job growth is causing companies to take on more space.  Leasing markets showed a distinct upturn late in the year, particularly in major business centers like New York and London.  Although landlord concessions have tightened, rents have not yet appreciated meaningfully.  Assuming the rebound remains on course, we will see rental growth in 2005, especially in healthier markets where supply and demand are near equilibrium."
 
New Segmentation
 
Effective with the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company reorganized its business segments by separating the Global Investment Management business from its geographic regions.  This has reduced revenues and earnings in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Asia Pacific regions, but has had no impact on consolidated results.  This action was taken in an effort to increase the Company's transparency of reporting in light
the growth in the Global Investment Management business.  All periods presented have been restated to conform with the 2004 presentation.
of
 
Americas Region
 
Fourth quarter revenue for the Americas region, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and South America, increased 29.5% to $541.1 million, compared with $417.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2003.  This increase was primarily related to strong sales and leasing activity in the U.S.
 
Operating income for the Americas region totaled $58.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with $17.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2003.  The $41.1 million, or 240.5%, increase was driven by the aforementioned revenue growth as well as lower amortization expense related to Insignia net revenue backlog(3) and the lack of merger-related costs in the current quarter, which ended in the third quarter of 2004.
 
Excluding the impact of all one-time items, operating income for the Americas region would have been $62.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of $19.7 million as compared to the fourth quarter of last year.  The Americas region's EBITDA totaled $73.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of $32.5 million or 79.4% from last year's fourth quarter.
 
EMEA Region
 
Revenue for the EMEA region, mainly consisting of operations in Europe, increased 18.5% to $166.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with $140.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2003.  Operating income for the EMEA region totaled $31.9 million for the current quarter, compared with an operating loss of $7.8 million for the same quarter last year.  Excluding one-time items related to the Insignia acquisition, operating income for this region would have been $32.5 million, which represents an increase of $11.5 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2003.  EBITDA for the EMEA region totaled $34.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of $24.4 million or 250.9% from last year's same period results.  The improvement over the 2003 fourth quarter primarily reflects strong investment sales activity.
Asia Pacific Region
 
In the Asia Pacific region, which includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, revenue totaled $50.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of 31.8% from $38.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2003.  Operating income for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $9.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2004, compared with $4.7 million for the same period last year. EBITDA for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $10.0 million for the current quarter, an increase of $4.6 million, or 84.3%, from last year's same period results. The improved results reflect increasing market share in Australia and China.  The Asia Pacific segment incurred minimal one-time costs associated with the Insignia acquisition.
 
Global Investment Management Business
 
In the Global Investment Management segment, which consists of investment management operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, revenue totaled $39.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of 62.6% from $24.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2003.  Operating income for the Global Investment Management segment totaled $11.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2004, compared with $5.2 million for the same period last year. EBITDA for the Global Investment Management segment totaled $16.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, an increase of $9.6 million or 132.5% from last year's same period results. The improved results are primarily driven by incentive fees earned in Japan.  The Global Investment Management segment incurred minimal one-time costs associated with the Insignia acquisition.
 
Business Line Performance
 
During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company gained a number of corporate clients, including Alcan, among others, and expanded its relationships with several others, including Textron.
 
In property management, AMB Property Corporation retained CB Richard Ellis to manage a 25 million square foot portfolio of industrial properties in California.
 
The Company's commercial mortgage brokerage business also performed well in 2004 as  total volume rose 21% from 2003 to $13.3 billion in 2004.  In addition, the Global Investment Management business benefited from the strong market for publicly traded REITs as a means of realizing profits on assets within its investment portfolio.  A $400 million J-REIT called New City Residence Investment Corp. was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in December 2004 and a $257 million technology-property REIT (the first of its kind) called Digital Realty Trust was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "DLR" in October 2004.
 
Full Year Results
(
4)
 
Full year revenue increased by $735.0 million, or 45.1%, to $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to the prior year.  Organic revenue growth was approximately 21% for 2004.  The Company recorded net income of $64.7 million, or
$0.91 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with a net loss of $34.7 million, or $0.68 net loss per diluted share, for the prior year.
 
Excluding one-time items, the Company would have earned net income of $117.9 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to net income of $36.8 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, for the prior year.
 
EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $245.3 million, representing an increase of $112.5 million, or 84.7%, from EBITDA of $132.8 million in 2003.  The 2004 results included $54.9 million of merger-related charges, integration costs and one-time compensation expense (associated with the Company's initial public offering) versus $50.4 million of merger-related and integration charges in 2003.
 
Subsequent Event
 
In 2005, the Company repurchased $25.4 million of its outstanding
senior subordinated notes at a premium of $3.8 million.  This is consistent with its stated objective of reducing debt and will generate additional interest savings of $2.9 million annually.

If the Company does update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that it will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.

In this regard, risk factors are specifically discussed under the headings "Risks Related to Our Business" and "Forward-Looking Statements" in CB Richard Ellis Group's Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2003, filed June 28, 2004.

(1) A reconciliation of net income to net income, as adjusted for one-time items, is provided in the exhibits to this release.
 
The Company's management believes that EBITDA is useful in evaluating its performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.  As a result, the Company's management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the performance of various business lines and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring its performance under its employee incentive programs.
(2)
 
However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and when analyzing the Company's operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, operating income (loss) and net income (loss), each as determined in accordance with GAAP.  Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.  The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
For a reconciliation of EBITDA with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
 
(3) The intangible asset amortization pertains to the net revenue backlog acquired in the Insignia transaction.  Net income cannot be recognized from purchased backlog; hence this amortization expense offsets that portion of operating income that was generated from the Insignia backlog acquired.
 
(4) The operating results for 2004 include the operations of Insignia.  However, the operating results from January 1 to July 23, 2003 do not include the operations of Insignia, as the Insignia acquisition occurred on July 23, 2003.  As such, our consolidated financial statements after the Insignia acquisition are not directly comparable to our consolidated financial statements prior to the Insignia acquisition.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The following measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC guidelines:
 
Net income, as adjusted for one-time items
(i)
                                    
 
Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted for one-time items
(ii)
                                 
 
EBITDA
(iii)
                              
 
Operating income, as adjusted for one-time items
(iv)
                             
 
The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of current results to prior periods as well as presenting the effects of one-time items in all periods presented.  The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of one-time items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of its business.
 
Net income (loss), as adjusted for one-time items and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted for one-time items are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
(1)  With adjustments to arrive at "Net income, as adjusted," a net loss translates into a net income position on an adjusted basis.  Accordingly, the weighted average impact of the dilutive effect of potential common shares of 963,830 and 849,235 have been considered in determining the dilutive earnings per share on a adjusted basis for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2003, respectively.
 
Operating income (loss), as adjusted for one-time items is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
The Company does not allocate net interest expense or provision (benefit) for income taxes among its segments.  Accordingly, EBITDA for segments is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
(1)   Includes Freddie MAC loan receivables and related non-recourse warehouse line of credit of $138.2 million and $230.8 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
(2)   Includes non-recourse debt relating to a building in Japan of $43.7 million at December 31, 2003.
