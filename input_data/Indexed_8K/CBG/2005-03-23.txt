Notes on U.S. performance returns.
Performance results have been calculated in accordance with NCREIF methodology and do not include the effect of leverage.
 - 
                 
Performance results are after deduction of acquisitions fees but before deduction of asset management fees, performance incentive fees and carried interest.
 - 
                 
Net cash flow is assumed to be distributed quarterly.
 - 
                 
The NCREIF Property Index data, once aggregated, may not be comparable to the performance of CBRE Investors due to current and historical differences in portfolio composition by asset size, geographic location and property type.
 - 
                 
Performance results represent discretionary accounts only.
