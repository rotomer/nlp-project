Los Angeles, CA - May 4, 2005  CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today reported first quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share of $0.19, compared with a loss of $0.26 in the first quarter of 2004.  Excluding one-time Insignia related and debt buy-back charges, first quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share was $0.25, compared with a loss per diluted share of $0.03 for the same quarter a year earlier.
 
Based on continued strength seen in all of the Company's lines of business and geographies, CB Richard Ellis raised its full year guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $2.10 to $2.20, excluding one-time Insignia related and debt buy-back charges.
 
First Quarter Highlights
For the first quarter of 2005, the Company generated revenue of $538.3 million, a 22.1% increase over the $441.0 million posted in the first quarter of 2004.  The Company reported first quarter net income of $14.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $16.6 million in the first quarter of 2004, or a loss per diluted share of $0.26.

Revenue
The first quarter revenue increase of 22.1% reflects improved performance across virtually all business lines.  Additionally, all three of our geographic regions posted strong year over year gains.
 
EBITDA()
2
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) totaled $50.2 million for the first quarter of 2005, an increase of $40.2 million, or 398.2%, from the same quarter last year.  The increase was primarily driven by strong revenue growth combined with improved operating margins and the absence of Insignia related costs in the current quarter, which significantly impacted first quarter 2004 results.
 
Interest Expense
Interest expense totaled $13.6 million for the first quarter of 2005, a decrease of $6.0 million, or 30.8%, compared with the same quarter last year.  The decrease was driven by the interest savings realized from the repayment of higher interest rate debt throughout 2004 and into 2005.
 
senior subordinated notes in the open market at a premium of $4.0 million.  Subsequently, in April 2005, the Company repurchased an additional $10.1 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 11% senior subordinated notes in the open market at a premium of $1.2 million.  These repurchases will further reduce annual interest expense by approximately $4.0 million.

Management's Commentary
"Our first quarter results were very strong, reflecting continued favorable trends in our core business lines," said Brett White, president of CB Richard Ellis.  "The U.S. investment market remains robust as equity capital continues to flow into real estate at a high level, and investors show an appetite for all property types.  Despite increases in short-term interest rates, long-term rates remain near historic lows and capital is plentiful.
 
"Meanwhile, the U.S. leasing market continues to recover with surplus office space being absorbed in many major metropolitan areas.  Notably, office rents rose modestly on a national basis, and landlords have curbed concessions in the face of reduced availability of space.
 
"In Europe, investment markets also remain strong and leasing trends continue to improve.  Major central business districts such as London, Paris and Madrid remain attractive for foreign and domestic capital as real estate offers compelling risk-adjusted cash-yields as compared with alternative income-producing investments."
Americas Region
First quarter revenue for the Americas region, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Latin America, increased 19.6% to $381.1 million, compared with $318.6 million for the first quarter of 2004.  This increase was attributable to higher investment sales transactions, strong commercial mortgage brokerage and appraisal/valuation activities, increased property and facilities management fees and the continued strengthening of the leasing market.
 
Operating income for the Americas region totaled $33.6 million for the first quarter of 2005, compared with $1.1 million for the first quarter of 2004.  The $32.5 million increase was driven by double-digit revenue growth as well as the lack of amortization expense related to Insignia net revenue backlog(3) and merger-related costs in the current quarter, both of which significantly impacted the prior year quarter.  Excluding the impact of these one-time items, operating income for the Americas region would have been $35.4 million for the first quarter of 2005, a healthy increase of $18.5 million as compared to the first quarter of last year.  The Americas region's EBITDA totaled $43.4 million for the first quarter of 2005, an increase of $30.6 million or 239.2% from last year's first quarter.
 
EMEA Region
Revenue for the EMEA region, mainly consisting of operations in Europe, increased 27.9% to $102.1 million for the first quarter of 2005, compared with $79.8 million for the first quarter of 2004.  Based upon the improved revenues, the EMEA region was able to generate a slight profit for the current quarter, compared with an operating loss of $10.1 million for the same quarter last year.  Excluding one-time items related to the Insignia acquisition, operating income for this region would have been $0.6 million, an increase of $4.8 million as compared to the first quarter of 2004.  EBITDA for the EMEA region totaled $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2005, an increase of $7.0 million over last year's first quarter negative EBITDA of $4.7 million.
 
Asia Pacific Region
In the Asia Pacific region, which includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, revenue totaled $33.9 million for the first quarter of 2005, an increase of 32.5% from $25.6 million for the first quarter of 2004.  Operating income for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $1.5 million for the first quarter of 2005, compared with an operating loss of $0.4 million for the same period last year. EBITDA for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $2.1 million for the current quarter, an increase of $1.6 million, or 275.8%, from the first quarter of 2004. The year-over-year first quarter improvement reflects increased business activity throughout the region.  The Asia Pacific segment did not incur any one-time costs associated with the Insignia acquisition in the current or prior year quarter.
Global Investment Management Business
In the Global Investment Management segment, which consists of investment management operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, revenue totaled $21.2 million for the first quarter of 2005, an increase of 24.5% from $17.0 million for the first quarter of 2004.  Operating income for this segment totaled $1.5 million for the first quarter of 2005, compared with $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2004.  EBITDA for the Global Investment Management segment totaled $2.4 million for the first quarter of 2005, an increase of $1.0 million or 69.0% from last year's same period results. The improved results are primarily driven by higher revenues in Japan.  The Global Investment Management segment incurred minimal one-time costs associated with the Insignia acquisition in the first quarter of 2004.
 
Business Line Activity
The Company's commercial mortgage brokerage business continues to perform well and had an especially strong quarter.  The flow of capital into real estate continues to be robust and the Company's pipeline of financing transactions is well ahead of the pace of 2004.
 
During the first quarter, CB Richard Ellis also expanded its services for several long-time corporate clients.  For example, Dow Chemical Company awarded CB Richard Ellis an additional 4.1 million square feet of facilities management in the U.S. and Europe, and Ford Motor Company tapped CB Richard Ellis to provide project management at its Dearborn, Michigan headquarters as well as for an additional 3 million square feet of facilities management assignments across the country.
 
The Global Investment Management business also continues to show strong growth.  In the first quarter, the Company acted as advisor to California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) in the pension fund's joint venture with First Industrial Realty Trust.  The joint venture will have a total investment capacity of $950.0 million.
 
2005 Guidance
As previously mentioned, the Company is raising its full-year guidance for 2005.  CB Richard Ellis expects to generate full year revenue of $2.6 billion, net income in the range of $160.0 million to $168.0 million, and diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.10 to $2.20, excluding residual one-time Insignia related and debt buy-back charges totaling approximately $15.0 million (pre-tax).
 
Subsequent Event
On April 11, 2005, Moody's increased the Company's ratings for its senior debt and senior subordinated debt to Ba3 and B1, respectively, and raised its rating outlook to positive.  Moody's attributed the ratings upgrade to improvement in the Company's operating performance, as well as its successful recapitalization, which has strengthened the Company's balance sheet.  The positive rating outlook reflects Moody's expectation
that the Company's leverage will decline further as it continues to pay down high interest rate debt, while continuing to strengthen earnings and expand market share.

If the Company does update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that it will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.

() The Company's management believes that EBITDA is useful in evaluating its performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.  As a result, the Company's management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the performance of various business lines and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring its performance under its employee incentive programs.
2
 
However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and when analyzing the Company's operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, operating income (loss) and net income (loss), each as determined in accordance with GAAP.  Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.  The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
 
For a reconciliation of EBITDA with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
 
The intangible asset amortization pertains to the net revenue backlog acquired in the Insignia transaction.  Net income cannot be recognized from purchased backlog; hence this amortization expense offsets that portion of operating income that was generated from the Insignia backlog acquired.

The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of current results to prior periods as well as presenting the effects of one-time items in all periods presented.  The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of one-time items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of its business.
Net income (loss), as adjusted for one-time items and diluted earnings (loss) per share, as adjusted for one-time items are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
