Notes:
 
EBITDA margins exclude one-time merger-related charges and integration expenses.
 
The 2004 TTM margin includes the combined company results for the second quarter of 2003 which was prior to the acquisition of Insignia.  Hence, the EBITDA margin for TTM 2004 is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what CB Richard Ellis' combined company EBITDA margin would have been had the Insignia acquisition in fact occurred prior to the third quarter of 2003.
