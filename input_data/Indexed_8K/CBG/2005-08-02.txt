FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
Los Angeles, CA  August 2, 2005  CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today reported second quarter 2005 revenue of $672.2 million, up 22.0% over the second quarter of 2004, and diluted earnings per share of $0.66 for the second quarter of 2005, compared with $0.04 in the second quarter of last year. Excluding one-time charges, second quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share was $0.70, compared with $0.32 for the same quarter a year earlier.
 
Based on continuing favorable trends in most of the Company's lines of business, CB Richard Ellis raised its full year 2005 guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $2.40 to $2.50, excluding one-time Insignia related and debt buy-back charges.
 
Second Quarter Highlights
 
For the second quarter of 2005, the Company generated revenue of $672.2 million, a 22.0% increase over the $550.9 million posted in the second quarter of 2004. The Company reported second quarter net income of $50.4 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, compared with net income of $3.0 million, or $0.04 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2004.
 
Excluding one-time items related to the Insignia acquisition and debt buy-back charges, which totaled $4.2 million ($3.1 million after-tax), the Company would have earned net income
1
of $53.5 million, or $0.70 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2005, compared with net income of $22.4 million, or $0.32 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2004.
Revenue
 
The second quarter revenue increase of 22.0% reflects improved performance across virtually all of the Company's business lines and geographies. A steady leasing recovery, combined with continued investment sales strength globally, fueled the double-digit growth.
 
EBITDA
2
 
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) totaled $106.5 million for the second quarter of 2005, an increase of $67.6 million, or 173.4%, from the same quarter last year. The increased EBITDA reflects strength across all the Company's business lines and continued cost control. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase is the absence of Insignia acquisition-related costs and one-time compensation expense related to the initial public offering of the Company's common stock in June 2004, both of which significantly impacted second quarter 2004 results.
 
Interest Expense
 
Interest expense totaled $13.4 million for the second quarter of 2005, a decrease of $5.4 million, or 28.8%, compared with the same quarter last year. The decrease was driven by the interest savings realized from the repayment of higher interest rate debt throughout 2004 and the first half of 2005.
 
During the second quarter of 2005, the Company repurchased $11.8 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 11% senior subordinated notes in the open market at a premium of $1.4 million. The year-to-date repurchases of $38.2 million will reduce annual interest expense by approximately $4.3 million.
 
Management's Commentary
 
"Consistent with our expectations, the U.S. leasing market is staging a steady recovery," said Brett White, chief executive officer of CB Richard Ellis. "The market cycle has reached an inflection point nationally, with most markets seeing measured increases in absorption, lower vacancies and modest rental gains. With employment growth continuing, leasing fundamentals are improving.
 
"U.S. real estate continues to attract high levels of capital, and investor appetite for all property types remains robust. Investor confidence has been bolstered by the turnaround of leasing market fundamentals as well as continuing low long-term interest rates. Meanwhile, increased capital allocations by financial institutions have helped fuel higher demand for real estate investments.
 
"In Europe, there is now a clear strengthening of demand for office space in London, Paris and Madrid, which are key indicators of an expected market recovery in 2006. In Asia, demand for office space is strong in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, all of which witnessed significant leasing activity, while China is generally becoming the
focus of growing institutional investor interest. International investment sales markets are strong virtually across the board."
 
Americas Region
 
Second quarter revenue for the Americas region, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Latin America, increased 27.4% to $489.9 million, compared with $384.5 million for the second quarter of 2004. This increase was mainly attributable to improved leasing activity, continued high volume of investment sales, increased appraisal/valuation activities, and higher property and facilities management fees.
 
Operating income for the Americas region totaled $69.0 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared with $12.3 million for the second quarter of 2004. The $56.7 million increase was driven by double-digit revenue growth across the board, as well as the lack of merger-related costs associated with the Insignia acquisition and one-time compensation expense associated with the initial public offering, both of which impacted the prior-year quarter. Excluding the impact of these one-time items, operating income for the Americas region would have been $70.7 million for the second quarter of 2005, an increase of $29.3 million, or 70.8%, as compared to the second quarter of last year. The Americas region's EBITDA totaled $79.9 million for the second quarter of 2005, an increase of $58.6 million, or 275.1%, from last year's second quarter.
 
EMEA Region
 
Revenue for the EMEA region, mainly consisting of operations in Europe, increased 13.7% to $123.1 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared with $108.3 million for the second quarter of 2004. Operating income for the EMEA segment totaled $10.7 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared with $5.1 million for the same period last year. Excluding one-time items related to the Insignia acquisition, operating income for this region would have been $11.3 million, an increase of $4.4 million, or 63.7%, as compared to the second quarter of 2004. EBITDA for the EMEA region totaled $13.0 million for the second quarter of 2005, an increase of $5.8 million, or 80.9%, from last year's second quarter. These improvements were primarily driven by a continued strong investment sales environment as well as improved leasing activity.
 
Asia Pacific Region
 
In the Asia Pacific region, which includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, revenue totaled $43.3 million for the second quarter of 2005, a 14.8% increase from $37.7 million for the second quarter of 2004. Operating income for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $6.6 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared with $5.2 million for the same period last year, an increase of 27.5%. EBITDA for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $7.6 million for the current quarter, an increase of $1.9 million, or 33.6%, from the second quarter of 2004. The year-over-year second quarter improvement generally reflects increased business activity throughout the region. The Asia Pacific segment did not incur any one-time costs associated with the Insignia acquisition or the initial public offering in the current or prior year quarter.
Global Investment Management Business
 
In the Global Investment Management segment, which consists of investment management operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, revenue totaled $15.9 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared with $20.4 million in the second quarter of 2004. This decrease was mainly due to acquisition and disposition fee revenue earned in the U.S. in the prior year quarter that did not recur as well as the timing of revenues realized in Japan. Operating loss for this segment totaled $5.4 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared with operating income of $2.8 million for the second quarter of 2004. This decrease was attributable to the aforementioned revenue decrease as well as compensation expense associated with funds concluding over the next three years with no related revenue recognition until they conclude. EBITDA for the Global Investment Management segment totaled $6.1 million for the second quarter of 2005, an increase of $1.3 million or 26.6% from last year's same period results. The improved EBITDA was primarily driven by an increase in equity earnings, which is included in the calculation of EBITDA but not in the calculation of operating income (loss). The Global Investment Management segment incurred minimal one-time costs associated with the Insignia acquisition in the second quarter of 2004.
 
Additional Business Line Highlights
 
The Company continues to make steady gains in its global Corporate Services portfolio, reflecting the increasing trend toward outsourcing of real estate services. Transaction management accounts in this line of business have grown to more than 1.5 billion square feet worldwide, an increase of approximately 10% as compared to December 31, 2004, and facilities management accounts total approximately 161 million square feet on a global basis, an increase of approximately 6% as compared to December 31, 2004. New Corporate Services accounts were established during the second quarter with companies such as DHL, Fujitsu North America, Hughes Supply and Bank of Nova Scotia. The Company also contracted to provide additional services for existing corporate clients, such as Avaya and Royal Bank of Canada.
 
At the same time, the Company's mortgage brokerage subsidiary, L.J. Melody, continued to capitalize on investors' healthy appetite for debt financing. For the first six months of 2005, mortgage originations increased 42% from a year earlier to $7.4 billion. Also during the quarter, CB Richard Ellis established a new specialty finance company, which raised $300 million to invest in debt instruments and originate new loans and preferred equity investments. CB Richard Ellis holds an equity stake of approximately 5% in this specialty finance company.
 
S&P Rating Upgrade
 
On May 25, 2005, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services raised its rating on CB Richard Ellis, including raising its credit rating to BB-' from B+', in response to the Company's improved operating performance and debt reduction activities.
Six-month Results
 
Six-month revenue increased by $218.5 million, or 22.0%, to $1.2 billion compared to the same period last year. The Company reported net income of $65.0 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2005 compared with a net loss of $13.6 million, or a loss of $0.22 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2004.
 
Excluding one-time items, the Company would have earned net income of $72.5 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2005 compared to net income of $19.8 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the same period in the prior year.
 
EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was $156.8 million, representing an increase of $107.7 million, or 219.6%, from EBITDA of $49.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004.
 
2005 Guidance
 
As previously mentioned, the Company is raising its full-year guidance for 2005. CB Richard Ellis expects to generate full year revenue of $2.7 billion, net income in the range of $183.0 million to $191.0 million, and diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.40 to $2.50, excluding residual one-time Insignia related and debt buy-back charges totaling approximately $14.0 million (pre-tax).

However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and when analyzing the Company's operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, operating income (loss) and net income (loss), each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
 
For a reconciliation of EBITDA with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
