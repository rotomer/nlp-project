FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Los Angeles, CA  November 1, 2005  CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today reported third quarter 2005 revenue of $744.2 million, up 29.4% over the third quarter of 2004, and diluted earnings per share of $0.74 for the third quarter of 2005, compared with $0.16 in the third quarter of last year.  Excluding one-time charges, third quarter 2005 diluted earnings per share was $0.75, an increase of 88% from $0.40 for the same quarter a year earlier.
 
Based on continuing favorable trends across all of the Company's business lines and geographies, CB Richard Ellis raised its full year 2005 guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $2.70 to $2.75, excluding one-time Insignia related and debt buy-back charges.
 
Third Quarter Highlights
For the third quarter of 2005, the Company generated revenue of $744.2 million, a 29.4% increase over the $575.0 million posted in the third quarter of 2004.  The Company reported third quarter net income of $56.9 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, compared with net income of $11.9 million, or $0.16 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2004.
 
Excluding one-time items, the Company would have earned
net incomeof $57.5 million, or $0.75 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2005, compared with net income of $29.7 million, or $0.40 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2004.

Revenue
The third quarter revenue increase of 29.4% reflects improved performance across virtually all of the Company's business lines and geographies.  A steady leasing market
recovery combined with increased appraisal activities and continued investment sales strength globally, fueled the double-digit growth.
  
EBITDA
2
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) totaled $111.2 million for the third quarter of 2005, an increase of $49.3 million, or 79.8%, from the same quarter last year.  The increased EBITDA reflects strength across the majority of the Company's business lines and continued cost control.  Also contributing to the year-over-year increase is the significant reduction of Insignia acquisition-related costs.
 
Interest Expense
Interest expense totaled $13.8 million for the third quarter of 2005, a decrease of $1.7 million, or 10.8%, compared with the same quarter last year.  The decrease was primarily driven by the interest savings realized from the repayment of higher interest rate debt throughout 2004 and 2005, predominantly the repurchase of outstanding bonds in the open market.
 
During the third quarter of 2005, the Company repurchased $4.5 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding
11% senior subordinated notes in the open market at a premium of $0.5 million.  The year-to-date repurchases of $42.7 million will reduce annualized interest expense by approximately $4.8 million.
 
Management's Commentary
Compared with a year ago, the Company's third quarter investment sales revenues grew by 41% and leasing revenues advanced by 15%.   "The third quarter saw a continuation of trends that have been in place all year: robust investment sales activity fueled by strong debt and equity capital flows into real estate, and leasing markets that are steadily improving in step with the economy," said Brett White, President and Chief Executive Officer of CB Richard Ellis.
 
"Overseas, increased cross-border investment activity has been a key factor in the continuing strength of most major investment markets. Leasing markets throughout Asia continue to exhibit strength, reflected in reduced vacancy and higher rents.  In Europe, leasing demand has picked up modestly in some major business centers including London and Madrid and a broader-based recovery is expected in 2006," Mr. White said.
 
"In this favorable market environment, the breadth and depth of our global platform has enabled us to capture increased market share and cross-sell more services to existing clients.  We are well positioned for continued growth due to the strength of our people and platform, and quality of our brand."
 
Americas Region
Third quarter revenue for the Americas region, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Latin America, increased 24.2% to $516.7 million, compared with $416.1 million for the
 
third quarter of 2004.  This increase was mainly attributable to improved leasing activity, continued high volume of investment sales, increased appraisal/valuation activities, and higher property and facilities management fees.
 
Operating income for the Americas region totaled $64.5 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared with $35.2 million for the third quarter of 2004.  The $29.3 million increase was driven by double-digit revenue growth, as well as the lack of merger-related costs associated with the Insignia acquisition, which impacted the prior-year quarter.  Excluding the impact of one-time items, operating income for the Americas region would have been $65.7 million for the third quarter of 2005, an increase of $21.8 million, or 49.8%, as compared to the third quarter of last year.  The Americas region's EBITDA totaled $75.0 million for the third quarter of 2005, an increase of $28.2 million, or 60.2%, from last year's third quarter.
 
EMEA Region
Revenue for the EMEA region, mainly consisting of operations in Europe, increased 42.8% to $149.6 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared with $104.8 million for the third quarter of 2004.    Operating income for the EMEA segment totaled $26.7 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared with $4.0 million for the same period last year.   Excluding one-time items related to the Insignia acquisition, operating income for this region would have been $26.9 million, an increase of $22.0 million, or 452.0%, as compared to the third quarter of 2004.  EBITDA for the EMEA region totaled $28.9 million for the third quarter of 2005, an increase of $23.1 million, or 395.0%, from last year's third quarter.  These improvements were primarily driven by a continued strong investment sales environment as well as improved leasing and appraisal activities.
 
Asia Pacific Region
In the Asia Pacific region, which includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, revenue totaled $44.1 million for the third quarter of 2005, an 18.1% increase from $37.3 million for the third quarter of 2004.  Operating income for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $5.9 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared with $4.5 million for the same period last year, an increase of 29.5%. EBITDA for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $6.4 million for the current quarter, an increase of $1.1 million, or 19.9%, from the third quarter of 2004. The year-over-year third quarter improvement generally reflects increased business activity throughout the region.  The Asia Pacific segment did not incur any one-time costs associated with the Insignia acquisition or the initial public offering in the current or prior year quarter.
 
Global Investment Management Business
In the Global Investment Management segment, which consists of investment management operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, revenue totaled $33.9 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared with $16.7 million in the third quarter of 2004.  This increase was mainly due to higher incentive fees earned in France and the U.S.  Operating loss for this segment totaled $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2005,
compared with operating income of $1.0 million for the same period last year.  EBITDA for the Global Investment Management segment totaled $0.8 million for the third quarter of 2005, a decrease of $3.0 million from last year's same period results.  These decreases were attributable in part to higher incremental incentive compensation expense of approximately $10.3 million accrued in the current year quarter for Global Investment Management dedicated executives and team leaders in connection with funds concluding over the next few years.  Only $0.5 million was accrued for this purpose in the third quarter of 2004.  Revenues associated with these expenses cannot be recognized until certain financial hurdles are met.  In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company expects to recognize income from some of these funds, which should offset the cumulative accrued incentive compensation expense to date. The Global Investment Management segment did not incur any one-time costs associated with the Insignia acquisition in the current or prior year quarter.
 
Additional Business Line Highlights
The Company's mortgage brokerage subsidiary, CBRE Melody, continued to capitalize on investors' healthy appetite for debt financing.  For the first nine months of 2005, mortgage originations increased 39% from a year earlier to $12.4 billion.  Reflecting a continuing outsourcing trend, the Company also expanded its relationships with several institutional accounts in its Asset Services portfolio during the third quarter, including AMB Property Corporation (with 32 million square feet now under management), Dividend Capital (7 million square feet now under management) and DBSI  Discovery Real Estate Services (4 million square feet now under management).  The Company also furthered its representation of Corporate Services accounts, such as Burlington Northern Santa Fe (more than 2 million square feet) and Regus Group (more than 6 million square feet).
 
Nine-month Results
Nine-month revenue increased by $387.7 million, or 24.7%, to $2.0 billion compared to the same period last year.  The Company reported net income of $121.9 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 compared with a net loss of $1.7 million, or a loss of $0.03 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2004.
 
Excluding one-time items, the Company would have earned net income of $130.0 million, or $1.70 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 compared to net income of $49.5 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, for the same period in the prior year.
 
EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $267.9 million, representing an increase of $157.0 million, or 141.6%, from $110.9 million for the same period of 2004.
 
Guidance
As previously mentioned, the Company is raising its full-year guidance for 2005.  CB Richard Ellis expects to generate full year revenue of approximately $2.8 billion, net income in the range of $207.0 million to $210.0 million, and diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.70 to $2.75, excluding residual one-time Insignia related and debt buy-back charges totaling approximately $14 million (pre-tax), as well as any additional one-time tax expense associated with the repatriation of offshore income under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, should the Company elect to do so.
 
Looking forward to 2006, consistent with its previously disclosed growth objectives, the Company estimates that it should generate revenue growth in the range of 7-9% with corresponding EBITDA growth of 12-14% and diluted earnings per share growth approximating 20%, excluding one-time items.  The Company plans to issue more specific guidance on 2006 as it approaches year-end.

A reconciliation of net income (loss) to net income, as adjusted for one-time items, is provided in the exhibits to this release.
 
The Company's management believes that EBITDA is useful in evaluating its performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.  As a result, the Company's management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the performance of various business lines and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring its performance under its employee incentive programs.
2
 
However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and when analyzing the Company's operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, operating income (loss) and net income (loss), each as determined in accordance with GAAP.  Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.  The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
 
For a reconciliation of EBITDA with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
 
 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
                The following measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC guidelines:
 
(i)
                                    
Net income, as adjusted for one-time items
 
(ii)
                                 
Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted for one-time items
 
(iii)
                              
EBITDA
 
(iv)
                             
Operating income (loss), as adjusted for one-time items
 
The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of current results to prior periods as well as presenting the effects of one-time items in all periods presented.  The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of one-time items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of its business.
 
Net income, as adjusted for one-time items and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted for one-time items are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
(1)
With adjustments to arrive at "Net income, as adjusted," a net loss translates into a net income position on an adjusted basis.  Accordingly, the weighted average impact of the dilutive effect of potential common shares of 3,657,688 has been considered in determining the dilutive earnings per share on an adjusted basis.
 
EBITDA for the Company is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
Operating income (loss), as adjusted for one-time items is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
The Company does not allocate net interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt or provision for income taxes among its segments.  Accordingly, EBITDA for segments is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
 
(1)
     
Includes Freddie MAC loan receivables and related non-recourse warehouse line of credit of $146.5 million and $138.2 million at September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.
(2)
     
Includes $29.2 million of non-recourse debt relating to an investment in Europe at September 30, 2005.
