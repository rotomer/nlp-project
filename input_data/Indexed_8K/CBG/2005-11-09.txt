Indemnification and Contribution.
 
(b) Each Selling Stockholder, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter, its partners, directors and officers and each person who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, and will reimburse the Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with the Selling Stockholder Information relating to such Selling Stockholder; and provided that with respect to
 
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement in or omission or alleged omission from any preliminary prospectus, the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection (b) shall not inure to the benefit of the Underwriter from whom the person asserting any such losses, claims, damages or liabilities purchased the Firm Securities concerned, to the extent that a prospectus relating to such Firm Securities was required by law to be delivered by the Underwriter in connection with such purchase and any such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) of the Underwriter results from the fact that there was not sent or given to such person, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Firm Securities to such person, a copy of the Prospectus if the Company had previously furnished copies thereof to the Underwriter in accordance with this Agreement; and provided, further, that the liability under this subsection (b) of each Selling Stockholder shall be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds after underwriting commissions and discounts, but before expenses, to such Selling Stockholder from the sale of Firm Securities sold by such Selling Stockholder hereunder.
 
(c) The Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, and each Selling Stockholder, its partners, members, directors, officers, and each person, if any, who controls such Selling Stockholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), joint or several, to which the Company or such Selling Stockholder may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), joint or several, arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the Underwriter specifically for use therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company and each Selling Stockholder in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by the Underwriter consists of the following information in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption "Underwriting," furnished on behalf of the Underwriter: (1) the selling concession figures appearing in the fourth paragraph, (2) the maximum underwriting discounts and commissions to be received by any member of the NASD appearing in the sixth paragraph, (3) the eighth and ninth paragraph related to stabilizing transactions, over-allotment transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids and (4) the eleventh paragraph related to prospectuses in electronic format.
 
(d) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , that the indemnified party shall have the right to employ counsel to represent it and its directors, officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Section 7 and, if the parties to any such action
provided, however
 
include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual conflicts of interests between them in relation to material aspects of the defense, the indemnified party and its directors, officers, employees and controlling persons may be jointly represented by one separate counsel, and, in that event, the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such (i) settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
 
(e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a), (b) or (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a), (b) or (c) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Stockholders bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the Selling Stockholders or the Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (e). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (e), (i) the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, and (ii) the liability under this subsection of each Selling Stockholder shall be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds after underwriting commissions and discounts, but before expenses, to such Selling Stockholder from the sale of the Firm Securities sold by such Selling Stockholder hereunder, less any amounts for which such Selling Stockholder is liable under subsection (b) above. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Selling Stockholders' obligations in this subsection (e) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective aggregate gross proceeds received after underwriting commissions and discounts, but before expenses, from the sale of the Firm Securities sold by the Selling Stockholders hereunder and not joint.
 
(f) The obligations of the Company and the Selling Stockholders under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Selling Stockholders may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriter under this Section shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company, to each Selling Stockholder, to each officer of the Company
 
who has signed a Registration Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company or any Selling Stockholder within the meaning of the Act.
 
8. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the several Selling Stockholders, of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriter set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf of the Underwriter, any Selling Stockholder, the Company or any of their respective representatives, officers or directors, partners, members, or any controlling person, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Firm Securities. If the purchase of the Firm Securities by the Underwriter is not consummated for any reason other than solely because of the occurrence of any event specified in clause (iii), (iv), (vi), (vii) or (viii) of Section 6(c), the Company will reimburse the Underwriter for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the offering of the Firm Securities.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the purchase by you of an aggregate of shares (the "Shares") of Class A Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Company from certain selling stockholders of the Company (the "Selling Stockholders") named in Schedule A to the Underwriting Agreement (as defined below) pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated November , 2005 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, the Selling Stockholders and you.
            
    
 
We have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-127118) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as it became effective under the Securities Act; the Company's prospectus, dated August 19, 2004, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement, dated November , 2005 (the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act, which pursuant to Form S-3 incorporates by reference or is deemed to incorporate by reference the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2005, June 30, 2005 and September 30, 2005, and the Company's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on January 4, 2005, January 25, 2005, February 25, 2005, March 15, 2005, March 23, 2005, May 13, 2005, May 27, 2005, June 8, 2005, June 29, 2005, August 2, 2005 and September 21, 2005 (collectively, the "Exchange Act Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and the Underwriting Agreement. We also have examined a specimen certificate representing the Common Stock of the Company. In addition, we have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing and upon originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments and such certificates or comparable documents or oral statements of public officials and of officers and
    
representatives of the Company and have made such other investigations, as we have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth. Our opinion that the Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act is based on oral advice from the staff of the Commission to that effect.
 
In such examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations stated herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
1. The Shares to be sold by the Selling Stockholders have been duly authorized by the Company and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
 
2. The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware and has full corporate power and authority to conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.
 
3. The statements made in the Prospectus under the caption "Description of Capital Stock", insofar as they purport to constitute summaries of the terms of the Company's capital stock (including the Shares), constitute accurate summaries of the terms of such capital stock in all material respects.
 
4. The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.
 
5. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement will not breach or result in a default under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or the Exchange Act Documents, nor will such action violate the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Company or any federal or New York state statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or any rule or regulation that has been issued pursuant to any federal or New York statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law or any order known to us issued pursuant to any federal or New York state statute or the Delaware General Corporation Law by any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties.
6. No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any federal or New York state governmental agency or body or any Delaware governmental agency or body acting pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law or, to our knowledge, any federal or New York state court or any Delaware state court acting pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law is required for the compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, except for the registration under the Securities Act of the Shares, and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Shares by the Underwriters.
 
7. The Registration Statement has become effective under the Securities Act, and the Prospectus was filed on November __, 2004 pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act; and, to our knowledge, no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued or proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission.
 
8. There are no preemptive rights under federal or New York state law or under the Delaware General Corporation Law to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock; and except as described in the Prospectus, there are no preemptive or other rights to subscribe for or purchase, nor any restriction upon the voting or transfer of, any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated By-Laws or any agreement or other instrument filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.
 
We do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of New York, the federal law of the United States and the Delaware General Corporation Law.
 
This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the above-described transaction. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by, or furnished to, any other person, firm or corporation without our prior written consent.
 
Very truly yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
Reference is hereby made to the purchase by you of an aggregate of shares (the "Shares") of Class A Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), of CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), from certain selling stockholders of the Company (the "Selling Stockholders") named in Schedule A to the Underwriting Agreement, dated November , 2005 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, the Selling Stockholders and you.
            
    
 
As General Counsel of the Company, I have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-127118) (the "Registration Statement") filed by the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as it became effective under the Securities Act; the Company's prospectus, dated August 19, 2005, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement, dated November , 2005 (the "Prospectus"), filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act, which pursuant to Form S-3 incorporates by reference or is deemed to incorporate by reference the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004, the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2005, June 30, 2005 and September 30, 2005, and the Company's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on January 4, 2005, January 25, 2005, February 25, 2005, March 15, 2005, March 23, 2005, May 13, 2005, May 27, 2005, June 8, 2005, June 29, 2005, August 2, 2005 and September 21, 2005 (collectively, the "Exchange Act Documents"), each as filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and the Underwriting Agreement. I also have examined a specimen certificate representing the Common Stock of the Company. In addition, I have examined, and have relied as to matters of fact upon, the documents delivered to you at the closing and upon originals, or duplicates or certified or conformed copies, of such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments and such certificates or comparable documents or oral statements of public officials and of officers and representatives of the Company and
    
have made such other investigations, as I have deemed relevant and necessary in connection with the opinions hereinafter set forth.
 
In such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as duplicates or certified or conformed copies and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents.
 
Based upon the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and limitations stated herein, I am of the opinion that:
 
1. All outstanding shares of the Common Stock, including the Shares to be sold by the Selling Stockholders, have been duly authorized by the Company and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
 
2. Each of the subsidiaries listed on Schedule I hereto (the "U.S. Significant Subsidiaries") has been duly incorporated, organized or formed, as the case may be, and is validly existing as a corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company, as the case may be, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, organization or formation, as the case may be, with corporate, partnership or company power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus; and each of the Company and the U.S. Significant Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company, as the case may be, in good standing in all jurisdictions in which its ownership or leasing of properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification; except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operation of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a "Material Adverse Effect"); all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each U.S. Significant Subsidiary has been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid and nonassessable; and, except as disclosed in the Prospectus or the Exchange Act Documents and for pledges in favor of Credit Suisse First Boston, as collateral agent under the amended and restated credit agreement dated as of April 23, 2004, among the Company, CB Richard Ellis Services, Inc., the Lenders (as defined therein) and Credit Suisse First Boston, as administrative agent (as such agreement has been amended), the capital stock of each U.S. Significant Subsidiary owned by the Company, directly or through subsidiaries, is owned free from liens, encumbrances and defects.
 
3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Underwriting Agreement and the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated will not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, any statute, rule or regulation, or any order known to me of any governmental agency or body or any court having jurisdiction over the
Company or any U.S. Significant Subsidiary or any of the properties of the Company or any of the properties of the U.S. Significant Subsidiary, or any agreement or instrument which the Company or a U.S. Significant Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or a U.S. Significant Subsidiary is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company or, to my knowledge, a U.S. Significant Subsidiary is subject, or the charter or by-laws of the Company or any U.S. Significant Subsidiary.
 
4. To my knowledge, there are no statutes or pending or threatened legal or governmental proceedings to which the Company or any U.S. Significant Subsidiary is a party or otherwise subject that would be required to be described in the Prospectus pursuant to the federal securities laws and regulations which are not described as required.
 
5. There are no contracts or agreements between the Company and any person granting such person the right (other than rights which have been waived or satisfied) to require the Company to include any securities of the Company owned or to be owned by such person in the securities registered pursuant to the Registration Statement.
 
6. The Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and files reports with the Commission on the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system.
 
7. The Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Shares will not be, an "investment company" within the meaning of, and subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
8. The Company and its subsidiaries own, possess or can acquire on reasonable terms, adequate intellectual property rights necessary to conduct the business now operated by them, or presently employed by them, and have not received any notice of infringement of or conflict with asserted rights of others with respect to any intellectual property rights that, if determined adversely to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
I have not independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements made or included in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus and take no responsibility therefor. Based upon my review of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus:
 
A. I advise you that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, and the Prospectus, as of November __, 2005, appeared, on its face, to be appropriately responsive, in all material respects, to the requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, except that in each case I express no view with respect to the financial statements or other financial data contained in, incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in, or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus; and
B. Nothing has come to my attention that causes me to believe that the Registration Statement, as of its effective date, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or that the Prospectus, as of November __, 2005 and as of the date hereof, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that in each case I express no belief with respect to the financial statements or other financial data contained in, incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference in, or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.
 
I do not express any opinion herein concerning any law other than the law of the State of California, the federal law of the United States and the Delaware General Corporation Law.
 
This opinion letter is rendered to you in connection with the above-described transaction. This opinion letter may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose, or relied upon by, or furnished to, any other person, firm or corporation without my prior written consent.
 
Very truly yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to Blum Strategic Partners, L.P., Blum Strategic Partners II, L.P. (each a "Blum Domestic Selling Stockholder" and collectively, the "Blum Domestic Selling Stockholders"), and Blum Strategic Partners II GmbH & Co. KG (the "Blum German Selling Stockholder", and together with the Blum Domestic Selling Stockholders, the "Blum Selling Stockholders"), in connection with the purchase by you of an aggregate of [6,000,000] shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock") of CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), from the Blum Selling Stockholders, pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, dated as of November __, 2005 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, the Blum Selling Stockholders, and you (the "Underwriter"). This letter is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 6(f) of the Underwriting Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein or unless the context otherwise requires, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Underwriting Agreement.
 
In rendering the opinions expressed in paragraphs (a) through (d) below (the "Opinions"), we have examined the Underwriting Agreement as well as originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments and such certificates or comparable documents of officers and representatives of the Blum Selling Stockholders, and have made such other and further investigations as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the Opinions.
 
In our examination of the Underwriting Agreement and the other documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the full legal capacity of all natural persons, the accuracy and completeness of all of the documents, the authenticity of all originals of the documents and the conformity to authentic originals of all of the documents submitted to us as copies (including telecopies). We have also assumed the validity and constitutionality of each relevant statute, rule, regulation and agency action covered by this opinion letter. As to matters of fact relevant to the Opinions expressed herein, we have relied on the
representations and warranties as to factual matters made in or pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, statements contained in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and the statements made in the certificates of officers or other appropriate representatives of the Blum Selling Stockholders. We have not independently established the facts so relied on. The Opinions are given in the context of the foregoing.
 
In addition, in connection with our opinion set forth in paragraph (a) below, we have assumed that (i) Depository Trust Company ("DTC") is a "securities intermediary" as defined in Section 8-102 of the UCC as in effect in the State of New York (the "UCC"), and the State of New York is the "securities intermediary's jurisdiction" of DTC for purposes of Section 8-110 of the UCC, (ii) Firm Securities to be sold by such Blum Selling Stockholders under the Underwriting Agreement are registered in the name of DTC or its nominee, and DTC or another person on behalf of DTC maintains possession of certificates representing such Securities, (iii) DTC indicates by book entries on its books that securities entitlements with respect to such Securities have been credited to the Underwriter's securities account, (iv) the Underwriter is purchasing such Securities without notice of any adverse claim (within the meaning of the UCC) and (v) DTC is purchasing such Securities without any notice of an adverse claim (within the meaning of the UCC).
 
Based upon, subject to and limited by the foregoing and subject also to the comments and qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that:
 
(a) With respect to the Firm Securities to be sold by each Blum Selling Stockholder, upon the payment and transfer contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriter will acquire a security entitlement with respect to such Firm Securities to be sold by the Blum Selling Stockholders, no action based on adverse claim may be asserted against the Underwriter within the meaning of Section 8-102 of the UCC and DTC shall be a "protected purchaser" of such Firm Securities within the meaning of Section 8-303 of the UCC.
 
(b) No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any federal or New York governmental agency or body or, to our knowledge, any federal or New York court is required for the sale of the Firm Securities by the Blum Selling Stockholders and the compliance by such Blum Selling Stockholders with the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement, except for the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of the Firm Securities, and such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Firm Securities by the Underwriter.
 
(c) The execution and delivery by each Blum Selling Stockholder of, and the performance by such Blum Selling Stockholder of its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement will not contravene (i) any provision of applicable law, or (ii) the organizational documents of such Blum
Selling Stockholder, or (iii) any indenture, loan agreement, mortgage, lease or other agreement or instrument to which such Blum Selling Stockholder is a party and that is identified by the Blum Selling Stockholders in an officer's certificate as a material agreement, which officer's certificate is attached as Exhibit A to this opinion or, (iv) to our knowledge, any judgment, order or decree of any governmental body, agency or court having jurisdiction over such Blum Selling Stockholder.
 
(d) The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by or on behalf of each of the Blum Selling Stockholders and each of the Blum Selling Stockholders has full right, power and authority under its respective organizational documents to sell, assign, transfer and deliver the Firm Securities delivered by such Blum Selling Stockholder pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement.
 
We express no opinion herein as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the state laws of the State of New York, the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, the federal laws of the United States of America, and, solely with respect to Opinions (c) and (d) to the extent they relate to the Blum German Selling Stockholder, the German Commercial Code. In addition, we express no opinion and make no statement herein with respect to the antifraud laws of any jurisdiction or the bankruptcy laws of Germany. The foregoing Opinions are legal opinions only and not a guaranty or warranty of the matters discussed herein. These Opinions are based upon currently existing statutes, rules, regulations and judicial decisions and are rendered as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to advise you of any change in any of the foregoing sources of law or subsequent developments in law or changes in facts or circumstances that might affect any matters or opinions set forth herein.
 
This opinion has been prepared solely for your use in connection with the Closing under the Underwriting Agreement on the date hereof, and should not be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise be referred to, and should not be filed with or furnished to any governmental agency or other person or entity, without the prior written consent of this firm.
