Revenue
The fourth quarter revenue increase of 19.8% reflects improved performance across all of the Company's business lines.  A steady leasing market recovery, combined with increased revenue from our investment management operations and continued investment sales strength, fueled the double-digit growth.
EBITDA
(2)
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) totaled $186.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of $51.8 million, or 38.5%, from the same quarter last year.  The increased EBITDA reflects strength across all of the Company's business lines and continued cost control.
 
Interest Expense
Interest expense totaled $13.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 4.5%, compared with the same quarter last year.  The decrease was primarily driven by the interest savings realized from the repurchase of outstanding bonds in the open market during the first three quarters of 2005.

Full-year EBITDA was $454.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, up $208.8 million or 85.1% compared to the prior year.
 
Management's Commentary
"2005 was a strong year for CB Richard Ellis," said Brett White, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "We benefited from robust flows of investment capital into commercial real estate, as well as a steady strengthening of leasing market fundamentals on a global basis.  Just as important, however, was the success of our people in seizing increased market share by harnessing our extensive service offering, worldwide reach, premier brand equity and broad knowledge base. This powerful combination remains in place as we enter 2006 with a growing client base, increasing market share, favorable macro-market conditions and good momentum overall."
 
Fourth-Quarter Segment Highlights
 
Americas Region
Fourth quarter revenue for the Americas region, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Latin America, increased 15.3% to $624.0 million, compared with $541.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2004.  This increase was mainly attributable to improved leasing activity,
continued high volume of investment sales, increased appraisal/valuation activities, and higher loan origination and servicing fees.
 
Operating income for the Americas region totaled $75.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with $58.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2004.  The $17.6 million increase was mainly driven by double-digit revenue growth.  Excluding the impact of one-time items, operating income for the Americas region would have been $76.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of $13.7 million, or 21.8%, as compared to the fourth quarter of last year.  The Americas region's EBITDA totaled $88.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of $15.0 million, or 20.4%, from last year's fourth quarter.
 
EMEA Region
Revenue for the EMEA region, mainly consisting of operations in Europe, increased 31.4% to $219.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with $166.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2004.  Operating income for the EMEA segment totaled $56.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with $31.9 million for the same period last year.   Excluding one-time items incurred in the prior year quarter, operating income increased $24.5 million, or 75.4%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2004.  EBITDA for the EMEA region totaled $60.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of $26.2 million, or 76.8%, from last year's fourth quarter.  These improvements were primarily driven by a continued strong investment sales environment as well as higher leasing activities. 
 
Asia Pacific Region
In the Asia Pacific region, which includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, revenue totaled $56.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, an 11.8% increase from $50.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2004.  Operating income for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $10.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with $9.2 million for the same period last year, an increase of 7.9%. EBITDA for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $11.2 million for the current quarter, an increase of $1.2 million, or 11.6%, from the fourth quarter of 2004. The year-over-year fourth quarter improvement continues to reflect increased business activity throughout the region.  The Asia Pacific segment did not incur any one-time costs in the current or prior year quarter.
 
Global Investment Management Business
In the Global Investment Management segment, which consists of investment management operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, revenue totaled $56.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with $39.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.  This increase was mainly due to revenue earned in the U.S as a result of the liquidation of certain funds.  Operating income for this segment totaled $16.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with operating income of $11.0 million for the same period last year, an increase of 48.5%.  EBITDA for the Global Investment Management segment totaled $26.2 million
for the fourth quarter of 2005, an increase of $9.4 million, or 56.2%, from last year's same period results.  The improved performance was mainly attributable to $28.0 million of revenue from funds liquidating (carried interest revenue) in the fourth quarter, offset by approximately $15.1 million of additional incentive compensation expense recognized for dedicated executives and team leaders associated with the carried interest programs.  For the full-year 2005, the Company recorded a total of $35.9 million of incentive compensation expense related to carried interest revenue, part of which pertained to the $28.0 million of revenue recognized in the fourth quarter of 2005 with the remainder (approximately $19.3 million) relating to future periods' revenue.  Revenues associated with these expenses cannot be recognized until certain financial hurdles are met.  The Company expects that income it will recognize from funds liquidating in 2006 and future years will more than offset the $19.3 million accrued incentive compensation expense previously recognized.  The Global Investment Management segment did not incur any one-time costs in the current or prior year quarters.
 
Global Investment Management assets under management grew 15% during the year to $17.3 billion at year-end.  During the year this business made over $5 billion of acquisitions throughout North America, Europe and Asia, and had $2.3 billion in sales.
 
Guidance
In 2006, as compared to 2005 performance, CB Richard Ellis expects to generate full year diluted earnings per share growth in the range of 15 to 20%, excluding one-time acquisition related and debt buy-back charges.

(1) A reconciliation of net income to net income, as adjusted for one-time items, is provided in the exhibits to this release.
 
The Company's management believes that EBITDA is useful in evaluating its performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.  As a result, the Company's management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the performance of various business lines and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring its performance under its employee incentive programs.
(2) 
 
However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and when analyzing the Company's operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, operating income and net income, each as determined in accordance with GAAP.  Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.  The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with
financial covenants and the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
 
For a reconciliation of EBITDA with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The following measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC guidelines:
 
Net income, as adjusted for one-time items

Operating income, as adjusted for one-time items
(iv)
                             
 
The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of current results to prior periods as well as presenting the effects of one-time items in all periods presented.  The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of one-time items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of its business.
Net income, as adjusted for one-time items and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted for one-time items are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
 
 
EBITDA for the Company is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Operating income, as adjusted for one-time items is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
 
Asia Pacific
 
The Asia Pacific segment did not incur any one-time costs associated with the Insignia acquisition or the initial public offering in the current or prior year periods.
