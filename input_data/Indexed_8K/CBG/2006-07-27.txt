FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
Los Angeles, CA  July 26, 2006  CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today reported revenue for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006 of $836.2 million, up 24% over the second quarter of 2005, and diluted earnings per share of $0.27 for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006, compared with $0.22 for the same quarter last year.  Excluding one-time charges(1)(predominantly due to costs related to extinguishment of debt), second quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share was $0.34, an increase of 48% from the $0.23 earned in the second quarter of 2005.
 
Second Quarter Highlights
 
For the second quarter of 2006, the Company generated revenue of $836.2 million, up 24.4% over the $672.2 million posted in the second quarter of 2005.  The Company reported net income of $64.3 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006 compared with net income of $50.4 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2005.
 
Excluding one-time items, the Company would have earned net income(2)of $79.2 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006, an increase of 48.0% and 47.8%, respectively, compared with net income of $53.5 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2005.
 
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)(
3)
totaled $147.0 million for the second quarter of 2006, an increase of $40.5 million, or 38.0%, from the same quarter last year.
 
The Company's second quarter results continue to reflect strong performance across virtually all business lines and geographies, as well as contributions from acquisitions.  Of
 
 
 
the 24.4% revenue growth, approximately two-thirds was due to organic growth and one-third was attributable to acquisitions completed in 2005 and earlier in 2006.  The double-digit organic growth was fueled by notably improved leasing activity in most major markets, continued strength in investment sales as well as increased revenue in the appraisal/valuation, mortgage brokerage, property and facilities management and investment management operations.
 
During the second quarter of 2006, the Company repurchased the remaining $164.7 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding
11%
senior subordinated notes at a premium of $9.3 million.  This repurchase combined with the new $600.0 million revolving credit facility, which fully replaced the former facility on more favorable terms, will reduce annual interest expense by approximately $25.0 million.
 
Six-Month Results
Revenue was $1.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2006, up $305.9 million, or 25.3%, compared to the same period last year.  Approximately two-thirds of the improvement was due to organic growth, while acquisitions completed in 2005 and earlier in 2006 drove the remainder of the revenue increase.  The Company reported net income of $101.2 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2006 compared to net income of $65.0 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
 
Excluding one-time items, the Company would have earned net income of $119.3 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2006, up 64.5% and 59.4%, respectively, over net income of $72.5 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2005.
 
EBITDA was $229.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006, up $72.9 million or 46.5% compared to the same period last year.
 
Management's Commentary
"Our overall business continues to perform very well.  Commercial real estate markets worldwide have good momentum, and the combination of people, brand and platform has enabled us to continue to gain market share," said Brett White, CB Richard Ellis' President and Chief Executive Officer.  "As expected, the growth rate seen in the U.S. investment sales market has eased back to a more orderly and sustainable rate of growth compared with the heated growth trends of 2004 and 2005, but still reflects a solid year-over-year increase.  Supported by expanding employment rolls, the U.S. leasing market continued to improve, seeing higher occupancy and increased rental rates in many business districts across the country.  At the same time, our Asset Services and Corporate Services businesses are growing strongly, fueled by the global outsourcing trend.  Overseas operations, led by Europe, continue to turn in robust results, as strong organic growth is being augmented by strategic in-fill acquisitions that expand the scope and reach of our service offerings."
 
 
Second-Quarter Segment Highlights
 
Americas Region
Second quarter revenue for the Americas region, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Latin America, increased 13.1% to $554.3 million, compared with $489.9 million for the second quarter of 2005.  This largely organic revenue increase was mainly attributable to a continued improving leasing trend and strong investment sales as well as higher mortgage brokerage, appraisal/valuation and property and facilities management fees.
 
Operating income for the Americas region totaled $84.0 million for the second quarter of 2006, compared with $69.0 million for the second quarter of 2005.  Excluding the impact of one-time items, operating income for the Americas region would have been $85.4 million for the second quarter of 2006, an increase of $14.7 million, or 20.8%, as compared to $70.7 million for the second quarter of last year.  The Americas region's EBITDA totaled $95.2 million for the second quarter of 2006, an increase of $15.3 million, or 19.2%, from last year's second quarter.
 
EMEA Region
Revenue for the EMEA region, mainly consisting of operations in Europe, increased 38.3% to $170.3 million for the second quarter of 2006, compared with $123.1 million for the second quarter of 2005.  Organic revenue growth accounted for slightly more than half of this increase, with the remainder coming from acquisitions completed in 2005 and earlier in 2006.  Operating income for the EMEA segment totaled $32.5 million for the second quarter of 2006, compared with $10.7 million for the same period last year.   Excluding the impact of one-time items, operating income for the EMEA region would have been $33.0 million for the second quarter of 2006, an increase of $21.6 million, or 190.9%, from the second quarter of last year.  EBITDA for the EMEA region totaled $35.8 million for the second quarter of 2006, an increase of $22.8 million, or 175.5%, from last year's second quarter.  These improvements were primarily driven by significantly higher leasing activities, a continued strong investment sales environment, higher appraisal/valuation revenues and operating leverage.
 
Asia Pacific Region
In the Asia Pacific region, which includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, revenue totaled $84.7 million for the second quarter of 2006, a 95.6% increase from $43.3 million for the second quarter of 2005.  Operating income for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $12.3 million for the second quarter of 2006, compared with $6.6 million for the same period last year, an increase of 87.8%.  EBITDA for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $12.1 million for the second quarter of 2006, an increase of $4.6 million, or 60.5%, from last year's second quarter. Approximately half of the profit improvement in this segment stems from the Company boosting its ownership percentage in its Japanese affiliate, IKOMA CB Richard Ellis KK, to 51% in early January 2006. The Asia Pacific segment did not incur any significant one-time costs in the current or prior year quarter.
Global Investment Management Business
In the Global Investment Management segment, which consists of investment management operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, revenue totaled $27.0 million for the second quarter of 2006, a 70.3% increase from the $15.9 million in the second quarter of 2005.  This increase was largely driven by higher core asset management fees earned in the U.S. and France attributable to an increasing asset management base.  Assets under management grew to $21.3 billion as of the end of the second quarter, up $4.0 billion, or 23%, from year-end 2005.  With the increase in revenue, this segment reported a reduced operating loss of $1.0 million for the second quarter of 2006, compared with an operating loss of $5.4 million for the same period last year.  The current quarter operating loss was driven by higher bonus expense as well as increased incentive compensation expense of $1.9 million recognized in the current year quarter for dedicated executives and team leaders associated with this segment's carried interest revenue programs.  For the second quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a total of $6.9 million of incentive compensation expense related to carried interest revenue, none of which pertained to revenue recognized in the second quarter of 2006.  Revenues associated with these expenses cannot be recognized until certain financial hurdles are met.  The Company expects that it will recognize income from funds liquidating in 2006 and future years that will more than offset accrued incentive compensation expense recognized.  EBITDA for this segment totaled $3.9 million for the second quarter of 2006, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 36.7%, from last year's second quarter. This decrease was driven by the aforementioned reasons as well as a decrease in equity earnings, which is included in the calculation of EBITDA but not in the calculation of operating loss.  Equity earnings were stronger in the second quarter of 2005 due to higher dispositions within selected funds.  The Company expects that overall results from this segment in the second half of 2006 will more than offset the EBITDA shortfall from the second quarter. The Global Investment Management segment did not incur any one-time costs in the current or prior year quarter.
 
Other Business Highlights
 
The Company's mortgage brokerage business improved in the second quarter, reflecting increased loan originations (up 12% for the first six months of 2006 to $8.3 billion) as well as increased referrals from other CB Richard Ellis business lines.
 
The Company continued to make strong gains in its outsourcing businesses partially due to the fact that its broad geographic reach is well aligned with the multi-market requirements of both institutional investors and large corporations.  U.S. Asset Services business achieved a net portfolio gain of 32 million square feet in the first half of 2006, compared with a 7 million square foot net increase for the same period of 2005.
For example, the Company furthered its representation of several major Corporate Services clients, including Boeing (85 million square foot portfolio), Northrop Grumman (55 million square foot portfolio) and DHL Express (28 million square foot portfolio).  In addition, the

() The Company's management believes that EBITDA is useful in evaluating its performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.  As a result, the Company's management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the performance of various business lines and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring its performance under its employee incentive programs.

However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and when analyzing the Company's operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income determined in accordance with GAAP.  Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.  The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
 
For a reconciliation of EBITDA with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The following measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC guidelines:

EBITDA
 
(iv)
                             
Operating income, as adjusted for one-time items
 
The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of current results to prior periods as well as presenting the effects of one-time items in all periods presented.  The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of one-time items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of its business.
