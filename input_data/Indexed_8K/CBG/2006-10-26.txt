FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Los Angeles, CA  October 25, 2006  CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today reported revenue for the third quarter ended September 30, 2006 of $903.9 million, up 21.5% over the third quarter of 2005, and diluted earnings per share of $0.39 for the third quarter ended September 30, 2006, compared with $0.25 for the same quarter last year. Excluding one-time charges(1), third quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share was $0.40, an increase of 60.0% from the $0.25 earned in the third quarter of 2005.
 
Third Quarter Highlights
 
For the third quarter of 2006, the Company generated revenue of $903.9 million, up 21.5% over the $744.2 million posted in the third quarter of 2005. The Company reported net income of $92.3 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2006 compared with net income of $56.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2005.
 
Excluding one-time items, the Company would have earned net income(2)of $94.5 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2006, an increase of 64.4% and 60.0%, respectively, compared with net income of $57.5 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2005.
 
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)(
totaled $163.5 million for the third quarter of 2006, an increase of $52.3 million, or 47.0%, from the same quarter last year.
3)
 
The Company's third quarter results continue to reflect strong performance across virtually all business lines and geographies, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Of the 21.5% revenue growth, approximately two-thirds was due to organic growth and one-third was attributable to acquisitions completed in 2005 and 2006. The double-digit organic
growth was fueled by notably improved leasing activity in most major markets as well as increased revenue in the appraisal/valuation, mortgage brokerage, property and facilities management and investment management operations. This marks the 16 straight quarter of double-digit year-over-year organic revenue growth.
th
 
Nine-Month Results
Revenue was $2.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, up $465.6 million, or 23.8%, compared to the same period last year. Approximately two-thirds of the improvement was due to organic growth, while acquisitions completed in 2005 and 2006 drove the remainder of the revenue increase. The Company reported net income of $193.5 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 compared to net income of $121.9 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
 
Excluding one-time items, the Company would have earned net income of $213.8 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, up 64.4% and 59.6%, respectively, over net income of $130.0 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2005.
 
EBITDA was $393.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006, up $125.2 million or 46.7% compared to the same period last year.
 
Management's Commentary
"Our business continues to perform very well in all our major geographies around the world," said Brett White, CB Richard Ellis' president and chief executive officer. "Our premier brand, global platform and client-service focus have enhanced our capture of market share and have positioned us to benefit significantly from the generally strong commercial real estate markets around the world. We are assisting many companies in the expansion of their operations due to continuing economic growth, and rental rates are rising as vacancy rates decline. As discussed previously, the buoyancy of the leasing market more than offset the expected pullback in investment sales activity. Overall, our business remains very strong as we approach year-end, traditionally our busiest time of the year."
 
Third-Quarter Segment Highlights
 
Americas Region
Third quarter revenue for the Americas region, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Latin America, increased 13.2% to $584.7 million, compared with $516.7 million for the third quarter of 2005. This largely organic revenue increase was mainly attributable to a continued improving leasing trend as well as higher mortgage brokerage, appraisal/valuation and property and facilities management fees.
Operating income for the Americas region totaled $87.9 million for the third quarter of 2006, compared with $64.5 million for the third quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact of one-time items, operating income for the Americas region would have been $90.6 million for the third quarter of 2006, an increase of $24.9 million, or 37.9%, as compared to $65.7 million for the third quarter of last year. The Americas region's EBITDA totaled $101.3 million for the third quarter of 2006, an increase of $26.2 million, or 34.9%, from last year's third quarter.
 
EMEA Region
Revenue for the EMEA region, mainly consisting of operations in Europe, increased 29.3% to $193.3 million for the third quarter of 2006, compared with $149.6 million for the third quarter of 2005. Organic revenue growth accounted for nearly half of this increase, with the remainder coming from acquisitions completed in 2005 and 2006. Operating income for the EMEA segment totaled $35.1 million for the third quarter of 2006, compared with $26.7 million for the same period last year. Excluding the impact of one-time items, operating income for the EMEA region would have been $35.5 million for the third quarter of 2006, an increase of $8.7 million, or 32.2%, from the third quarter of last year. EBITDA for the EMEA region totaled $38.7 million for the third quarter of 2006, an increase of $9.8 million, or 34.0%, from last year's third quarter. These improvements were primarily driven by significantly higher sales and leasing activities as well as higher appraisal/valuation revenues.
 
Asia Pacific Region
In the Asia Pacific region, which includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, revenue totaled $84.5 million for the third quarter of 2006, a 91.6% increase from $44.1 million for the third quarter of 2005. The Company's acquisition of a majority stake in its Japanese affiliate IKOMA CB Richard Ellis KK in January 2006 accounted for just over half of the revenue increase, with the remainder primarily coming from organic growth throughout the region. Operating income for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $5.0 million for the third quarter of 2006, compared with $5.9 million for the same period last year. EBITDA for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $8.3 million for the third quarter of 2006, an increase of $1.9 million, or 30.0%, from last year's third quarter. Integration activities related to IKOMA and investment in growth in China have impacted margins in the Asia Pacific segment; however the Company expects that operating income and EBITDA will rise upon full integration of IKOMA and as the benefits from investment spending in China are realized.
 
Global Investment Management Business
In the Global Investment Management segment, which consists of investment management operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, revenue totaled $41.4 million for the third quarter of 2006, a 22.1% increase from the $33.9 million recorded in the third quarter of 2005. This increase was mainly due to carried interest revenue earned in the U.S. as a result of
the liquidation of a fund. Assets under management grew to $25.0 billion as of the end of the third quarter, up $7.7 billion, or 44.5%, from year-end 2005.
 
This segment reported operating income of $10.9 million for the third quarter of 2006, compared with an operating loss of $1.2 million for the same period last year. EBITDA for this segment totaled $15.2 million for the third quarter of 2006, an increase of $14.3 million from last year's third quarter. The improved performance was mainly attributable to $13.5 million of revenue from a fund liquidating (carried interest revenue) in the third quarter as well as $3.8 million of lower incentive compensation expense recognized for dedicated executives and team leaders associated with this segment's carried interest programs.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, the Company recorded a total of $22.8 million of incentive compensation expense related to carried interest revenue, only $2.0 million of which pertained to revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2006 with the remainder relating to future periods' revenue. Revenues associated with these expenses cannot be recognized until certain financial hurdles are met. The Company expects that it will recognize income from funds liquidating in future quarters that will more than offset accrued incentive compensation expense recognized. The Global Investment Management segment did not incur any one-time costs in the current or prior year quarter.
 
Other Business Highlights
 
The Company's mortgage brokerage business continues to post steady gains in loan origination volume. For the first nine months of 2006, total volume increased 14.6% to $14.2 billion. The Company is benefiting from a continued strong appetite for debt financing as well as increased referrals from other CB Richard Ellis business lines.
 
The Company continued to post significant growth in its outsourcing services directed to institutional and corporate customers. Net growth in the U.S. Asset Services portfolio improved by 200% with a net gain of 43 million square feet in the first nine months of 2006, compared with a 14 million square foot increase for the same period in 2005. The Company also was awarded significant new outsourcing assignments from corporate clients, including Wachovia, WPP Group, Cintas, The Hartford, TIAA-CREF and RBC Dain Rauscher, totaling in the aggregate approximately 39 million square feet globally.
 
Guidance
 
The Company is increasing its full year guidance for 2006. CB Richard Ellis expects to generate full year diluted earnings per share growth of approximately 45%, excluding one-time charges, as compared to 2005 performance.

(1) One-time charges include amortization expense related to net revenue backlog acquired in acquisitions, integration costs related to acquisitions and loss on extinguishment of debt.
 
(2) A reconciliation of net income to net income, as adjusted for one-time items, is provided in the exhibits to this release.
 
The Company's management believes that EBITDA is useful in evaluating its performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. As a result, the Company's management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the performance of various business lines and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring its performance under its employee incentive programs.
(3)
 
However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and when analyzing the Company's operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
 
For a reconciliation of EBITDA with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The following measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC guidelines:
 
Net income, as adjusted for one-time items

Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted for one-time items
(ii)

Operating income, as adjusted for one-time items
(iv)
                             
 
The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of current results to prior periods as well as presenting the effects of one-time items in all periods presented. The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of one-time items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of its business.
Net income, as adjusted for one-time items and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted for one-time items are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
 
 
EBITDA for the Company is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
