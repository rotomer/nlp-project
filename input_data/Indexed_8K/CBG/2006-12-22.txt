If an event of default under the Credit Agreement shall occur and be continuing, the commitments thereunder may be terminated and the principal outstanding amount, together with all accrued unpaid interest and other amounts owed thereunder, may be declared immediately due and payable.

Except for Loans deemed made pursuant to Section 2.02(f), the Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is (i) an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum (except with respect to any Incremental Term Borrowing, to the extent otherwise provided in the related Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement) or (ii) equal to the remaining available balance of the applicable Commitments.

B Loans being outstanding hereunder at any time or (ii) more than five Fixed Rate Borrowings of any other Class being outstanding hereunder at any time. For purposes of the foregoing, Borrowings having different Interest Periods or Contract Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Borrowings.
(c) Except with respect to Loans deemed made pursuant to Section 2.02(f), each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as the Administrative Agent may designate not later than 4:00 p.m., Local Time, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly credit the amounts so received to an account in the name of the applicable Borrower, designated by such Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request, or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts so received to the respective Lenders.
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with paragraph (c) above and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If the Administrative Agent shall have so made funds available then, to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender for the first three days, a rate determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds for the applicable currency and for each day thereafter, the higher of such rate and the applicable Daily Rate (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error). If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Borrower shall be entitled to request any Revolving Credit Borrowing if the Interest Period or Contract Period, as the case may be, requested with respect thereto would end after the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.
(f) If the Issuing Bank shall not have received from the applicable Borrower the payment required to be made by Section 2.23(e) within the time specified in such Section, the Issuing Bank will promptly notify the Administrative Agent of the L/C Disbursement and the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each applicable Revolving Credit Lender of such L/C Disbursement and its Pro Rata Percentage thereof. Each Domestic Revolving Credit Lender (in respect of a Domestic L/C Disbursement), Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender (in the case of a Multicurrency L/C Disbursement) and U.K. Revolving Credit Lender (in respect of a U.K. L/C Disbursement) shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on such date (or, if such Revolving Credit Lender shall have received such notice later than 12:00 (noon), Local Time, on any day, not later than 10:00 a.m., Local Time, on the immediately following Business Day), an amount equal to such Revolving Credit Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of such L/C Disbursement (it being understood that such amount shall be deemed to constitute an ABR Revolving Loan (if denominated in
 
dollars or Canadian Dollars) or a Fixed Rate Loan with a one-month Interest Period or Contract Period, as the case may be (if denominated in any other Alternative Currency), of such Revolving Credit Lender and such payment shall be deemed to have reduced the applicable L/C Exposure), and the Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the Issuing Bank amounts so received by it from such Revolving Credit Lenders. The Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the Issuing Bank any amounts received by it from a Borrower pursuant to Section 2.23(e) prior to the time that any Revolving Credit Lender makes any payment pursuant to this paragraph (f); any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent thereafter will be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Credit Lenders that shall have made such payments and to the Issuing Bank, as their interests may appear. If any Revolving Credit Lender shall not have made its applicable Pro Rata Percentage of such L/C Disbursement available to the Administrative Agent as provided above, such Revolving Credit Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay interest on such amount, for each day from and including the date such amount is required to be paid in accordance with this paragraph to but excluding the date such amount is paid, to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank at (i) in the case of such Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.06(a), and (ii) in the case of such Revolving Credit Lender, for the first such day, a rate determined by the Issuing Bank to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds for the applicable currency, and for each day thereafter, the higher of such rate and the Alternate Base Rate or the Foreign Base Rate, as the case may be.

In order to request a Borrowing (other than a Swingline Loan or a deemed Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.02(f), as to which this Section 2.03 shall not apply), the applicable Borrower shall hand deliver or fax to the Administrative Agent a duly completed Borrowing Request (a) in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., Local Time, three Business Days before a proposed Borrowing, and (b) in the case of a Daily Rate Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the Business Day of a proposed Borrowing.

If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the requested Borrowing shall be a Daily Rate Borrowing if denominated in dollars or Canadian Dollars, and a Fixed Rate Borrowing with a one-month Interest Period or Contract Period otherwise. If no election as to the Class of any Revolving Credit Borrowing by the U.S. Borrower is received, then, to the extent of the available Domestic Revolving Credit Commitments, such Borrowing shall be a Domestic Revolving Credit Borrowing. If no Interest Period or Contract Period with respect to any Fixed Rate Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period or Contract Period of one month's duration. The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the applicable Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.03 (and the contents thereof), and of each Lender's portion of the requested Borrowing.

SECTION 2.14. . Except with respect to Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by Section 2.20:
Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Change in Law shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of or credit extended by any Lender or the Issuing Bank (except any such reserve requirement which is reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate, the Discount Rate or the Bank Bill Rate), or shall impose on such Lender or the Issuing Bank or any applicable interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Fixed Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein (other than any change to the basis or rate of taxation applicable to any Lender), and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of making or maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan or increase the cost to any Lender of issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or purchasing or maintaining a participation therein or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) by an amount deemed by such Lender or the Issuing Bank to be material, then the applicable Borrowers will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, upon demand such additional amount or amounts (without duplication of amounts paid by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.20) as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank shall have determined that any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made or participations in Letters of Credit purchased by such Lender pursuant hereto or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank pursuant hereto to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender or the Issuing Bank to be material, then from time to time the applicable Borrower shall pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as applicable, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above, and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis on which such amount or amounts were calculated shall be delivered to the U.S. Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank the amount shown as due on any such certificate delivered by it within 20 days after its receipt of the same.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction
 
in return on capital shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the Borrowers shall not be under any obligation to compensate any Lender or the Issuing Bank under paragraph (a) or (b) above with respect to increased costs or reductions with respect to any period prior to the date that is 120 days prior to such request if such Lender or the Issuing Bank knew or could reasonably have been expected to know of the circumstances giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of the fact that such circumstances would result in a claim for increased compensation by reason of such increased costs or reductions; that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any increased costs or reductions arising out of the retroactive application of any Change in Law within such 120-day period. The protection of this Section shall be available to each Lender and the Issuing Bank regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the Change in Law that shall have occurred or been imposed.

SECTION 2.15. . (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Change in Law shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurocurrency Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurocurrency Loan, then, by written notice to the applicable Borrower and to the Administrative Agent:
Change in Legality
(i) such Lender may declare that Eurocurrency Loans will not thereafter (for the duration of such unlawfulness) be made by such Lender hereunder (or be continued for additional Interest Periods and Daily Rate Loans will not thereafter (for such duration) be converted into Eurocurrency Loans), whereupon any request for a Eurocurrency Borrowing (or to convert an ABR Borrowing to a Eurocurrency Borrowing or to continue a Eurocurrency Borrowing for an additional Interest Period) shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a request for a Daily Rate Loan (or a request to continue a Daily Rate Loan as such or to convert a Eurocurrency Loan into a Daily Rate Loan, as the case may be), unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and
(ii) such Lender may require that all outstanding Eurocurrency Loans made by it be converted to Daily Rate Loans, in which event all such Eurocurrency Loans shall be automatically converted to Daily Rate Loans as of the effective date of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.
In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise have been applied to repay the Eurocurrency Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the converted Eurocurrency Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the Daily Rate Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurocurrency Loans.
(b) For purposes of this Section 2.15, a notice to the applicable Borrower by any Lender shall be effective as to each Eurocurrency Loan made by such Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period then applicable to such Eurocurrency Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the applicable Borrower.
SECTION 2.16. . The Borrowers shall indemnify each Lender against any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) any event, other than a default by such Lender in the performance of its obligations hereunder, which results in (i) such Lender receiving or being deemed to receive any amount on account of the principal of any Fixed Rate Loan prior to the end of the Interest Period or Contract Period in effect therefor,
Indemnity
 
(ii) the conversion of any Fixed Rate Loan to a Daily Rate Loan, or the conversion of the Interest Period or Contract Period with respect to any Fixed Rate Loan, in each case other than on the last day of the Interest Period or Contract Period in effect therefor, or (iii) any Fixed Rate Loan to be made by such Lender (including any Fixed Rate Loan to be made pursuant to a conversion or continuation under Section 2.10) not being made after notice of such Loan shall have been given by the Borrowers hereunder (any of the events referred to in this clause (a) being called a "") or (b) any default in the making of any payment or prepayment of any Eurocurrency Loan required to be made hereunder. In the case of any Breakage Event, such loss shall include an amount equal to the excess, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its cost of obtaining funds for the Fixed Rate Loan that is the subject of such Breakage Event for the period from the date of such Breakage Event to the last day of the Interest Period in effect (or that would have been in effect) for such Loan over (ii) the amount of interest likely to be realized by such Lender in redeploying the funds released or not utilized by reason of such Breakage Event for such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts which such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16, and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis on which such amount or amounts were calculated, shall be delivered to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Breakage Event
SECTION 2.17. . Except as provided below in this Section 2.17 with respect to Swingline Loans and as required under Section 2.13(h) and Section 2.15, each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of interest on the Loans, each payment of the Facility Fees, each reduction of the Term Loan Commitments or the Revolving Credit Commitments and each conversion of any Borrowing to or continuation of any Borrowing as a Borrowing of any Type shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective applicable Commitments (or, if such Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Loans). For purposes of determining the available Domestic Revolving Credit Commitments or Multicurrency Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders at any time, each outstanding Swingline Loan shall be deemed to have utilized the Domestic Revolving Credit Commitments (in the case of a Domestic Swingline Loan) or Multicurrency Revolving Credit Commitments (in the case of a N.Z. Swingline Loan) of the Lenders (including those Lenders which shall not have made Swingline Loans) pro rata in accordance with such respective Domestic Revolving Credit Commitments or Multicurrency Revolving Credit Commitments. Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender's portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round each Lender's percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole dollar amount.
Pro Rata Treatment
SECTION 2.18. . Each Lender agrees that if it shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim against a Borrower or any other Loan Party, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of any Loan or Loans or L/C Disbursement as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of its Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of the Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements of any other Lender, it shall be deemed simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender at face value, and shall promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase price for, a participation in the Loans and L/C Exposure of such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans and L/C Exposure and participations in Loans and L/C Exposure held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to
Sharing of Setoffs
 
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans and L/C Exposure then outstanding as the principal amount of its Loans and L/C Exposure prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event was to the principal amount of all Loans and L/C Exposure outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event; , , that if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.18 and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without interest. The Borrowers and Holdings expressly consent to the foregoing arrangements and agree that any Lender holding a participation in a Loan or L/C Disbursement deemed to have been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by any Borrower and Holdings to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan directly to a Borrower in the amount of such participation.

SECTION 2.19. . (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment (including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any L/C Disbursement or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder and under any other Loan Document not later than 2:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due in immediately available funds, without setoff, defense or counterclaim. Each such payment (other than (i) Issuing Bank Fees, which shall be paid directly to the Issuing Bank, and (ii) principal of and interest on Swingline Loans, which shall be paid directly to the applicable Swingline Lender except as otherwise provided in Section 2.22(e)) shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at Eleven Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10010 or such other address as the Administrative Agent may from time to time designate. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its pro rata share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment.
Payments
(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.
(c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower does not in fact make such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, and to pay interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term funds (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) in the applicable currency.
SECTION 2.20. . (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower or any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if any Borrower or any Loan Party shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes
provided
 
Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or such Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower or such Loan Party shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower or such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b) In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) Each Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 15 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Borrower or any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the applicable Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) If a Borrower determines in good faith that a reasonable basis exists for contesting a Tax, the relevant Lender (or participant), or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall cooperate with such Borrower in challenging such Tax at such Borrower's expense if requested by such Borrower. If a Lender (or participant) or the Administrative Agent receives a refund (including pursuant to a claim for refund made pursuant to the preceding sentence) in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.20, it shall within 30 days from the date of such receipt pay over such refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 2.20 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender (or participant) or the Administrative Agent (together with any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); , that such Borrower, upon the request of such Lender (or participant) or the Administrative Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus penalties, interest or other charges) to such Lender (or participant) or the Administrative Agent in the event such Lender (or participant) or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
provided, however
(e) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by a Borrower or any other Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(f) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower is located, or pursuant to any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to
 
such Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate and shall deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent two further copies of any such form or certification (or any applicable successor form) on or before the date that any such form or certification expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously delivered by it to such Borrower. Each Lender that shall become a participant or a Lender pursuant to Section 9.04 shall, upon the effectiveness of the related transfer, be required to provide all the forms and statements required pursuant to this Section 2.20(f) provided that in the case of a participant such participant shall furnish all such required forms and statements to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased.

(a) In the event (i) any Lender or the Issuing Bank delivers a certificate requesting compensation pursuant to Section 2.14, (ii) any Lender or the Issuing Bank delivers a notice described in Section 2.15, (iii) any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or the Issuing Bank or any Governmental Authority on account of any Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.20 or (iv) any Lender refuses to consent to a proposed amendment, waiver, consent or other modification of this Agreement or any other Loan Document which has been approved by the Required Lenders and which additionally requires the consent of such Lender for approval pursuant to Section 9.08(b), the U.S. Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender or the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender or the Issuing Bank to transfer and assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (or, in the case of clause (iv) above, all its interests, rights and obligations with respect to the Class of Loans or Commitments that is the subject of the related consent, amendment, waiver or other modification) to an assignee that shall assume such assigned obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (x) such assignment shall not conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction, (y) the U.S. Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Revolving Credit Commitment is being assigned, of the Issuing Bank and the Domestic Swingline Lender (in the case of a Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment) and the N.Z. Swingline Lender (in the case of a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Commitment)), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, and (z) the applicable Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to the affected Lender or the Issuing Bank in immediately available funds an amount equal to the sum of the principal of and interest accrued to the date of such payment on the outstanding Loans or L/C Disbursements of such Lender or the Issuing Bank, respectively, plus all Fees and other amounts accrued for the account of such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (including any amounts under Section 2.14 and Section 2.16), in each case with respect to the Loans or Commitments subject to such assignment; that, if prior to any such transfer and assignment the circumstances or event that resulted in such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or notice under Section 2.15 or the amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.20, as the case may be, cease to cause such Lender or the Issuing Bank to suffer increased costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital, or cease to have the consequences specified in Section 2.15, or cease to result in amounts being payable under Section 2.20, as the case may be (including as a result of any action taken by such Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to paragraph (b) below), or if such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall waive its right to claim further compensation under Section 2.14 in respect of such
Assignment of Commitments Under Certain Circumstances; Duty to Mitigate

circumstances or event or shall withdraw its notice under Section 2.15 or shall waive its right to further payments under Section 2.20 in respect of such circumstances or event or shall consent to the proposed amendment, waiver, consent or other modification, as the case may be, then such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall not thereafter be required to make any such transfer and assignment hereunder.
(b) If (i) any Lender or the Issuing Bank shall request compensation under Section 2.14, (ii) any Lender or the Issuing Bank delivers a notice described in Section 2.15 or (iii) any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or the Issuing Bank or any Governmental Authority on account of any Lender or the Issuing Bank, pursuant to Section 2.20, then such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall use reasonable efforts (which shall not require such Lender or the Issuing Bank to incur an unreimbursed loss or unreimbursed cost or expense or otherwise take any action inconsistent with its internal policies or legal or regulatory restrictions or suffer any disadvantage or burden deemed by it to be significant) (x) to file any certificate or document reasonably requested in writing by a Borrower or (y) to assign its rights and delegate and transfer its obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if such filing or assignment would reduce its claims for compensation under Section 2.14 or enable it to withdraw its notice pursuant to Section 2.15 or would reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.20, as the case may be, in the future. The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the Issuing Bank in connection with any such filing or assignment, delegation and transfer.
SECTION 2.22. . (a) . Subject to the terms and conditions and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, (i) the Domestic Swingline Lender agrees to make Domestic Swingline Loans to the U.S. Borrower, in dollars, at any time and from time to time on and after the Closing Date and until the earlier of the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and the termination of the Domestic Revolving Credit Commitments in accordance with the terms hereof, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (x) the aggregate principal amount of all Domestic Swingline Loans exceeding $20,000,000 in the aggregate or (y) the Aggregate Domestic Revolving Credit Exposure, after giving effect to any Domestic Swingline Loan, exceeding the Total Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment, and (ii) the N.Z.

(e) . The Domestic Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any Business Day require the Domestic Revolving Credit Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the outstanding Domestic Swingline Loans.

In furtherance of the foregoing, each Domestic Revolving Credit Lender and Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
Participations
 
Domestic Swingline Lender or N.Z. Swingline Lender, respectively, such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of such Swingline Loans. Each Domestic Revolving Credit Lender and Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Domestic Revolving Credit Lender and Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02(c) with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Credit Lender (and Section 2.02(c) shall apply, , to the payment obligations of the Revolving Credit Lenders) and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Credit Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the U.S. Borrower and the New Zealand Borrower, as the case may be, of any participations in any Swingline Loan of such Borrower acquired pursuant to this paragraph and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to a Swingline Lender.

The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve any Borrower (or other party liable for obligations of any Borrower) of any default in the payment thereof.
mutatis mutandis
SECTION 2.23. . (a) . Any Borrower may request the issuance of a Letter of Credit for its own account or for the account of any of its Subsidiaries (in which case such Borrower and such Subsidiary shall be co-applicants with respect to such Letter of Credit), in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time while the L/C Commitments to any Borrower remain in effect. The Borrowers and the Lenders acknowledge the issuance of Letters of Credit prior to the Restatement Date under the Existing Credit Agreement and agree that, to the extent outstanding on the Restatement Date, such Letters of Credit shall continue to be outstanding pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. This Section shall not be construed to impose an obligation upon the Issuing Bank to issue any Letter of Credit that is inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Letters of Credit
General
(b) . In order to request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or to amend, renew or extend an existing Letter of Credit), a Borrower shall hand deliver or fax to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) below), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof, whether such Letter of Credit is to be a Domestic Letter of Credit, a Multicurrency Letter of Credit or a U.K. Letter of Credit and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare such Letter of Credit. All Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be Domestic Letters of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if, and upon issuance, amendment,
Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions

(c) . Each Letter of Credit shall expire at the close of business on the earlier of the date that is one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit and the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, unless such Letter of Credit expires by its terms on an earlier date; , that a Letter of Credit may, upon the request of a Borrower, include a provision whereby such Letter of Credit shall be renewed automatically for additional consecutive periods of 12 months or less (but not beyond the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date) unless the Issuing Bank notifies the beneficiary thereof at least 30 days prior to the then applicable expiration date that such Letter of Credit will not be renewed.
Expiration Date
provided, however
(d) . By the issuance of a Domestic Letter of Credit and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Domestic Revolving Credit Lender, and each such Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, effective upon the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of the Existing Letters of Credit, upon the Closing Date). By the issuance of a Multicurrency Letter of Credit and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender, and each such Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, effective upon the issuance of such Letter of Credit. By the issuance of a U.K. Letter of Credit and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each U.K. Revolving Credit Lender, and each such Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit, effective upon the issuance of such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Domestic Revolving Credit Lender, each Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender and each U.K. Revolving Credit Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of each Domestic L/C Disbursement, Multicurrency L/C Disbursement or U.K. L/C Disbursement, respectively, made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the applicable Borrower (or, if applicable, another party pursuant to its obligations under any other Loan Document) forthwith on the date due as provided in Section 2.02(f). Each Revolving Credit Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
Participations
 
(e) . If the Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Bank an amount equal to such L/C Disbursement on or prior to the Business Day following the day on which such Borrower shall have received notice from the Issuing Bank that payment of such draft will be made; that to satisfy its reimbursement obligation under this paragraph (e), a Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.22 an ABR Revolving Loan or a Domestic Swingline Loan (in the case of a Domestic Letter of Credit), a Canadian Prime Rate Loan (in the case of a Multicurrency Letter of Credit denominated in Canadian Dollars), a N.Z. Swingline Loan (in the case of a Multicurrency Letter of Credit denominated in New Zealand Dollars) or a Fixed Rate Loan (in the case of a U.K. Letter of Credit or a Multicurrency Letter of Credit denominated in a currency other than Canadian Dollars or New Zealand Dollars) to be made by the applicable Revolving Credit Lenders or the applicable Swingline Lender, as the case may be, in the aggregate amount of any such L/C Disbursement.
Reimbursement
provided
(f) . Each Borrower's obligations to reimburse L/C Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) above shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, under any and all circumstances whatsoever, and irrespective of:
Obligations Absolute
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document, or any term or provision therein;
(ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the provisions of any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document;
(iii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right that any Borrower, any other party guaranteeing, or otherwise obligated with, any Borrower, any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof or any other person may at any time have against the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any other person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other related or unrelated agreement or transaction;
(iv) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;
(v) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and
(vi) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind of the Issuing Bank, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or any other person or any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a Borrower's obligations hereunder.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that the absolute and unconditional obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to reimburse L/C Disbursements will not be excused by the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Issuing Bank. However, the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to
 
the Borrowers to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrowers that are caused by the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or wilful misconduct in determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof; it is understood that the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary and, in making any payment under any Letter of Credit (i) the Issuing Bank's exclusive reliance on the documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein, including reliance on the amount of any draft presented under such Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the beneficiary thereunder equals the amount of such draft and whether or not any document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be insufficient in any respect, if such document on its face appears to be in order, and whether or not any other statement or any other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect whatsoever and (ii) any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the documents presented under such Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in each case, be deemed not to constitute wilful misconduct or gross negligence of the Issuing Bank.
(g) . The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall as promptly as possible give telephonic notification, confirmed by fax, to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Borrower of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an L/C Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve such Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank or the Revolving Credit Lenders with respect to any such L/C Disbursement. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each applicable Revolving Credit Lender notice thereof.
Disbursement Procedures
provided
(h) . If the Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, then, unless the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement in full on such date, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest for the account of the Issuing Bank, for each day from and including the date of such L/C Disbursement, to but excluding the earlier of the date of payment by such Borrower or the date on which interest shall commence to accrue thereon as provided in Section 2.02(f), at the rate per annum that would apply to such amount if such amount were a Daily Rate Revolving Loan.
Interim Interest
(i) . The Issuing Bank may resign at any time by giving 30 days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the U.S. Borrower, and may be removed at any time by the U.S. Borrower by notice to the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Issuing Bank hereunder by a Lender that shall agree to serve as successor Issuing Bank, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the interests, rights and obligations of the retiring Issuing Bank and the retiring Issuing Bank shall be discharged from its obligations to issue additional Letters of Credit hereunder. At the time such removal or resignation shall become effective, the Borrowers shall pay all accrued and unpaid fees pursuant to Section 2.05(e). The acceptance of any appointment as the Issuing Bank hereunder by a successor Lender shall be evidenced by an agreement entered into by such successor, in a form satisfactory to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and, from and after the effective date of such agreement, (i) such successor Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of the previous Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan
Resignation or Removal of the Issuing Bank
 
Documents and (ii) references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the resignation or removal of the Issuing Bank hereunder, the retiring Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation or removal, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
(j) . If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Borrowers shall, on the Business Day they receive notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Credit Lenders holding participations in outstanding Letters of Credit representing greater than 50% of the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit) thereof and of the amount to be deposited, deposit in an account with the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Revolving Credit Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the L/C Exposure as of such date. Such deposit shall be held by the Collateral Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Obligations. The Collateral Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits in Permitted Investments, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Collateral Agent, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall (i) automatically be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for L/C Disbursements for which the Issuing Bank has not been reimbursed, (ii) be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the L/C Exposure, and (iii) if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Credit Lenders holding participations in outstanding Letters of Credit representing greater than 50% of the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit), be applied to satisfy the Obligations. If the Borrowers are required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrowers within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.
Cash Collateralization
(k) The U.S. Borrower may, at any time and from time to time with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and such Lender, designate one or more additional Lenders to act as an issuing bank under the terms of this Agreement. Any Lender designated as an issuing bank pursuant to this paragraph (k) shall be deemed (in addition to being a Lender) to be the Issuing Bank with respect to Letters of Credit issued or to be issued by such Lender, and all references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term "Issuing Bank" shall, with respect to such Letters of Credit, be deemed to refer to such Lender in its capacity as Issuing Bank, as the context shall require. Each Lender acting as an Issuing Bank hereunder shall promptly provide to the Administrative Agent such information with respect to the Letters of Credit issued by such Lender as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to allow the Administrative Agent to calculate the L/C Exposure of any Class, the L/C Participation Fees and the other Obligations with respect to outstanding Letters of Credit.
Additional Issuing Banks.
SECTION 2.24. (a) The U.S. Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent from time to time, request that the Revolving Credit Commitments of one or more Classes be increased by an aggregate amount not to exceed the Incremental Amount at such time. Upon the approval of such request by the Administrative
Increase in Revolving Credit Commitments.
 
Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), the Administrative Agent shall deliver a copy thereof to each Revolving Credit Lender. Such notice shall set forth the amount of the requested increase in the total Revolving Credit Commitments, and the allocation thereof among the Classes (which shall be in minimum increments of $5,000,000 and a minimum amount of $10,000,000 or equal to the remaining Incremental Amount) and the date on which such increase is requested to become effective (which shall be not less than 10 Business Days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice and which, in any event, must be on or prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date), and shall offer each Revolving Credit Lender with a Commitment of the affected Class the opportunity to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class by its Pro Rata Percentage of the proposed increased amount. Each Revolving Credit Lender shall, by notice to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent given not more than 10 days after the date of the Administrative Agent's notice, either agree to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class by all or a portion of the offered amount (each Revolving Credit Lender so agreeing being an "") or decline to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment (and any Revolving Credit Lender that does not deliver such a notice within such period of 10 days shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment) (each Revolving Credit Lender so declining or being deemed to have declined being a ""). In the event that, on the 10th day after the Administrative Agent shall have delivered a notice pursuant to the second sentence of this paragraph, the Revolving Credit Lenders shall have agreed pursuant to the preceding sentence to increase their Revolving Credit Commitments by an aggregate amount less than the increase in the total Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class requested by the U.S. Borrower, the U.S. Borrower may arrange for one or more banks or other entities (any such bank or other entity referred to in this clause (a) being called an ""), which may include any Lender, to extend Revolving Credit Commitments or increase their existing Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class in an aggregate amount equal to the unsubscribed amount; that each Augmenting Revolving Lender, if not already a Revolving Credit Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent, the applicable Swingline Lender (in the case of a Domestic Revolving Credit Commitment or a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Commitment) and the Issuing Bank (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the Borrowers and each Augmenting Revolving Lender shall execute all such documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence its Revolving Credit Commitment and/or its status as a Revolving Credit Lender hereunder. Any increase in the total Revolving Credit Commitment of a Class may be made in an amount which is less than the increase requested by the U.S. Borrower if the U.S. Borrower is unable to arrange for, or chooses not to arrange for, Augmenting Revolving Lenders.
Increasing Revolving Lender
Non-Increasing Revolving Lender
Augmenting Revolving Lender
provided
(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may take any and all actions as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that, after giving effect to any increase in the total Revolving Credit Commitments of a Class pursuant to Section 2.24(a), the outstanding Revolving Loans (if any) of such Class are held by the Revolving Credit Lenders of such Class in accordance with their new Pro Rata Percentages. This may be accomplished at the discretion of the Administrative Agent (i) by requiring the outstanding Revolving Loans to be prepaid with the proceeds of a new Revolving Credit Borrowing, (ii) by causing Non-Increasing Revolving Lenders to assign portions of their outstanding Revolving Loans to Increasing Revolving Lenders and Augmenting Revolving Lenders, or (iii) by any combination of the foregoing. Any prepayment or assignment described in this paragraph (b) shall be subject to Section 2.16, but otherwise without premium or penalty.
 
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the total Revolving Credit Commitments of a Class shall become effective under this Section 2.24 unless, (i) on the date of such increase, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 4.01 shall be satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the U.S. Borrower, and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received (with sufficient copies for each of the Revolving Credit Lenders) legal opinions, board resolutions and an officer's certificate consistent with those delivered on the Restatement Date under clauses (a)(i), (a)(ii), (a)(iii), (c)(ii)(B) and (d) of Section 4.02.
SECTION 2.25. (a) The U.S. Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent from time to time, request Incremental Term Loan Commitments in an amount not to exceed the Incremental Amount from one or more Incremental Term Lenders (which may include any existing Lender) willing to provide such Incremental Term Loan Commitments; that each Incremental Term Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). Such notice shall set forth (i) the amount of the Incremental Term Loan Commitments being requested (which shall be in minimum increments of $5,000,000 and a minimum amount of $10,000,000 or equal to the remaining Incremental Amount), (ii) the date on which such Incremental Term Loan Commitments are requested to become effective (which shall not be less than 10 Business Days nor more than 60 days after the date of such notice), and (iii) whether such Incremental Term Loan Commitments are commitments to make additional Tranche A Loans, commitments to make additional Tranche B Loans or commitments to make Term Loans with terms different from the Tranche A Loans and Tranche B Loans ("").
Incremental Term Loan Commitments.
provided
Other Term Loans
(b) The U.S. Borrower and each Incremental Term Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Incremental Term Loan Commitment of such Incremental Term Lender. Each Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement shall specify the terms of the Incremental Term Loans to be made thereunder; that (i) without the prior written consent of the Required Lenders, (x) the final maturity date of any Other Term Loans shall be no earlier than the Tranche B Maturity Date and (y) the weighted average life to maturity of any Other Term Loans shall be no shorter than the weighted average life to maturity of the Tranche B Loans, and (ii) the other terms of any Term Loans, to the extent not consistent with this Agreement, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Term Loan Commitment evidenced thereby.
provided
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Incremental Term Loan Commitment shall become effective under this Section 2.25 unless (i) on the date of such effectiveness, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 4.01 shall be satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the U.S. Borrower, (ii) at the time of, and after giving effect to, the incurrence of the Incremental Term Loans to be made under such Incremental Term Loan Commitment, the U.S. Borrower would be in Pro Forma Compliance, and (iii) the Administrative Agent shall have received (with sufficient copies for each of the Incremental Term Lenders) legal
 
opinions, board resolutions and an officer's certificate consistent with those delivered on the Restatement Date under clauses (a)(i), (a)(ii), (c)(ii)(B) and (d) of Section 4.02.
(d) Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent may take any and all action as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that all Incremental Term Loans (other than Other Term Loans), when originally made, are included in each Borrowing of outstanding Tranche A Loans or Tranche B Loans, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis. This may be accomplished at the discretion of the Administrative Agent by requiring each outstanding Eurocurrency Tranche A Borrowing or Eurocurrency Tranche B Borrowing, as the case may be, to be converted into an ABR Term Borrowing on the date of each Incremental Term Loan, or by allocating a portion of each Incremental Term Loan to each outstanding Eurocurrency Tranche A Borrowing or Eurocurrency Tranche B Borrowing, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis, even though as a result thereof such Incremental Term Loan may effectively have a shorter Interest Period than the Term Loans included in the Borrowing of which they are a part (and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that would prohibit such an initial Interest Period). Any conversion of Eurocurrency Term Loans to ABR Term Loans required by the preceding sentence shall be subject to Section 2.16. If any Incremental Term Loan is to be allocated to an existing Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Term Borrowing then, subject to Section 2.07, the interest rate applicable to such Incremental Term Loan for the remainder of such Interest Period and the other economic consequences thereof shall be as set forth in the applicable Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement. In addition, to the extent any Incremental Term Loans are Tranche A Loans or Tranche B Loans, the scheduled amortization payments under Sections 2.11(a)(i) or 2.11(a)(ii), as the case may be, required to be made after the making of such Incremental Term Loans shall be ratably increased by the aggregate principal amount of such Incremental Term Loans.
SECTION 2.26. (a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Canadian Borrower may request a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Borrowing denominated in Canadian Dollars by presenting drafts for acceptance and purchase as B/As by the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lenders.
Bankers' Acceptances.
 
(b) No Contract Period with respect to a B/A to be accepted and, if applicable, purchased as a Multicurrency Revolving Loan shall extend beyond the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. All B/As and B/A Loans shall be denominated in Canadian Dollars.
(c) To facilitate availment of B/A Loans, the Canadian Borrower hereby appoints each Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender as its attorney to sign and endorse on its behalf (in accordance with a Borrowing Request relating to a B/A Loan pursuant to Section 2.03 or 2.10), in handwriting or by facsimile or mechanical signature as and when deemed necessary by such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender, blank forms of B/As in the form requested by such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender. The Canadian Borrower recognizes and agrees that all B/As signed and/or endorsed by a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender on behalf of the Canadian Borrower shall bind the Canadian Borrower as fully and effectually as if signed in the handwriting of and duly issued by the proper signing officers of the Canadian Borrower. Each Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender is hereby authorized (in accordance with a Borrowing Request relating to a B/A Loan) to issue such B/As endorsed in blank in such face amounts as may be determined by such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender; that the aggregate amount thereof is equal to the aggregate amount of B/As required to be accepted and purchased by such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender. No Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender shall be liable for any damage, loss or other claim arising by reason of any loss or improper use of
provided
 
any such instrument except for the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender or its officers, employees, agents or representatives. Each Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender shall maintain a record, which shall be made available to the Canadian Borrower upon its request, with respect to B/As (i) received by it in blank hereunder, (ii) voided by it for any reason, (iii) accepted and purchased by it hereunder, and (iv) canceled at their respective maturities. On request by or on behalf of the Canadian Borrower, a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender shall cancel all forms of B/As which have been pre-signed or pre-endorsed on behalf of the Canadian Borrower and that are held by such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender and are not required to be issued in accordance with the Canadian Borrower's irrevocable notice. Alternatively, the Canadian Borrower agrees that, at the request of the Administrative Agent, the Canadian Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a "depository note" which complies with the requirements of the Depository Bills and Notes Act (Canada), and consents to the deposit of any such depository note in the book-based debt clearance system maintained by the Canadian Depository for Securities.
(d) Drafts of the Canadian Borrower to be accepted as B/As hereunder shall be signed as set forth in this Section 2.26. Notwithstanding that any person whose signature appears on any B/A may no longer be an authorized signatory for any Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender or the Canadian Borrower at the date of issuance of a B/A, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if such authority had remained in force at the time of such issuance and any such B/A so signed shall be binding on the Canadian Borrower.
(e) Promptly following the receipt of a Borrowing Request specifying a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Borrowing by way of B/A, the Administrative Agent shall so advise the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lenders and shall advise each Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender of the aggregate face amount of the B/A to be accepted by it and the applicable Contract Period (which shall be identical for all Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lenders). In the case of Multicurrency Revolving Loans comprised of B/A Loans, the aggregate face amount of the B/A to be accepted by a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of C$100,000 and shall be a whole multiple of C$100,000, and such face amount shall be in the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lenders' pro rata portions of such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Borrowing, that the Administrative Agent may in its sole discretion increase or reduce any Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender's portion of such B/A Loan to the nearest C$100,000 without reducing the aggregate Multicurrency Revolving Credit Commitments.
provided
(f) The Canadian Borrower may specify in a Borrowing Request pursuant to Section 2.03 or 2.10 that it desires that any B/A requested by such Borrowing Request be purchased by the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lenders, in which case the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lenders shall, upon acceptance of a B/A by a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender, purchase each B/A from the Canadian Borrower at the Discount Rate for such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender applicable to such B/A accepted by it and provide to the Administrative Agent the Discount Proceeds for the account of the Canadian Borrower. The Acceptance Fee payable by the Canadian Borrower to a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender under Section 2.06(d) in respect of each B/A accepted by such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender shall be set off against and deducted from the Discount Proceeds payable by such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender under this Section 2.26.
(g) Each Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender may at any time and from time to time hold, sell, rediscount or otherwise dispose of any or all B/As accepted and purchased by it.
 
(h) If a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender is not a chartered bank under the Bank Act (Canada) or if a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender notifies the Administrative Agent in writing that it is otherwise unable to accept Bankers' Acceptances, such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender will, instead of accepting and purchasing Bankers' Acceptances, make an advance (a "") to the Canadian Borrower in the amount and for the same term as the draft that such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender would otherwise have been required to accept and purchase hereunder. Each such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender will provide to the Administrative Agent the Discount Proceeds of such B/A Equivalent Loan for the account of the Canadian Borrower. Each such B/A Equivalent Loan will bear interest at the same rate that would result if such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender had accepted (and been paid an Acceptance Fee) and purchased (on a discounted basis at the Discount Rate) a Bankers' Acceptance for the relevant Contract Period (it being the intention of the parties that each such B/A Equivalent Loan shall have the same economic consequences for the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lenders and the Canadian Borrower as the Bankers' Acceptance which such B/A Equivalent Loan replaces). All such interest shall be paid in advance on the date such B/A Equivalent Loan is made, and will be deducted from the principal amount of such B/A Equivalent Loan in the same manner in which the deduction based on the Discount Rate and the applicable Acceptance Fee of a Bankers' Acceptance would be deducted from the face amount of the Bankers' Acceptance.
B/A Equivalent Loan
(i) The Canadian Borrower waives presentment for payment and any other defense to payment of any amounts due to a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender in respect of a B/A accepted and purchased by it pursuant to this Agreement which might exist solely by reason of such B/A being held, at the maturity thereof, by such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender in its own right, and the Canadian Borrower agrees not to claim any days of grace if such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender, as holder, claims payment from or sues the Canadian Borrower on the B/A for payment of the amount payable by the Canadian Borrower thereunder. On the last day of the Contract Period of a B/A, or such earlier date as may be required or permitted pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the Canadian Borrower shall pay the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender that has accepted and purchased a B/A or advanced a B/A Equivalent Loan the full face amount of such B/A or B/A Equivalent Loan, as the case may be, and, after such payment, the Canadian Borrower shall have no further liability in respect of such B/A and such Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender shall be entitled to all benefits of, and be responsible for all payments due to third parties under, such B/A.
(j) Except as required by any Multicurrency Revolving Credit Lender upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, no B/A Loan may be repaid by the Canadian Borrower prior to the expiry date of the Contract Period applicable to such B/A Loan; , , that any B/A Loan may be defeased as provided in Section 2.12(a).

Agents
The bank serving as the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings, any Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder.
Neither Agent shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) neither Agent shall be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) neither Agent shall have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that such Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.08), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, neither Agent shall have any duty to disclose, nor shall it be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to Holdings, any Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent and/or Collateral Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. Neither Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.08) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct. Neither Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by Holdings, a Borrower or a Lender, and neither Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan
 
Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to such Agent.
Each Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper person. Each Agent may also rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for a Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
Each Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it.

Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, either Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the U.S. Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the U.S. Borrower and, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, with the consent of the U.S. Borrower (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the U.S. Borrower and such successor. After an Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.05 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while acting as Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

Exhibit 10.2
 
October 30, 2006
Robert E. Sulentic
6037 Lakehurst Avenue
Dallas, TX 75230
 
Dear Bob:
Robert E. Sulentic (the "Executive") and Trammell Crow Company (the "Company") are parties to that certain employment letter agreement dated as of October 17, 2003 (the "Original Agreement"), which sets forth the terms of the Executive's employment with the Company. On April 6, 2004 and October 17, 2005, the Executive and the Company amended the Original Agreement (the Original Agreement, as amended, is hereinafter referred to as the "Employment Agreement").
Pursuant to a certain Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the Company, CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (the "Acquirer") and A-2 Acquisition Corp. (the "Acquisition Subsidiary"), the Acquisition Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") and, as a result of the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquirer. The effective time of the Merger is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time." C.B. Richard Ellis, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary or the Acquirer, is hereinafter referred to as the "Employer."
In connection with the consummation of the Merger, the Employer and the Executive wish to amend and supplement the Employment Agreement in certain respects as set forth in this letter agreement (this "Amendment"). The Executive and the Employer acknowledge and agree that this Amendment is being entered into for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged. Each capitalized term used but not otherwise defined in this Amendment will have the meaning given to that term in the Employment Agreement.
1. . The provisions set forth in Sections 2 through 7 of this Amendment shall take effect at, but not before, the Effective Time. If the Merger Agreement is terminated before the Merger is consummated, upon such termination, this Amendment shall automatically terminate and be void .
Effectiveness
ab initio
2. . In accordance with Section 10(b) of the Employment Agreement (and, for the avoidance of doubt, effective upon the Effective Time), the Employer hereby expressly assumes and agrees to perform the Employment Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company was required to perform the Employment Agreement (as amended by this Amendment). The Executive acknowledges that this Amendment constitutes a written agreement that satisfies the requirements of such Section 10(b). Furthermore, in accordance with such Section 10(b), all references in the Employment Agreement to the Company with respect to obligations and periods from and after the Effective Time (including, without limitation, in the definition of "Investment Plan" and "Awards") shall be references to the Employer. In addition, all references in the Employment Agreement with respect to periods and obligations from and after the Effective Time to (a) the "Trammell Crow Company Long-Term Incentive Plan" shall become references to the CB Richard Ellis Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan and (b) the "Trammell Crow Company and Associated Companies Welfare Benefits Plan" shall become references to the health, life and disability insurance policies, all death and disability plans, practices, policies and programs and all other welfare benefit plans, practices, policies and programs applicable generally to other executives of the Employer.
Effect of Merger on the Company
3. . The parties acknowledge that, effective upon the Effective Time, a Change in Control will occur. Therefore, all provisions in the Employment Agreement (as amended by this Amendment) that are triggered by a Change in Control will automatically become effective and all provisions in the Employment Agreement (as amended by this Amendment) that apply from a Change in Control until the second anniversary of a Change in Control shall apply from the Effective Time until the expiration of the Employment Period. For the avoidance of doubt, the merger of the Employer or the Acquirer with or into a parent-level entity or wholly-owned subsidiary of the Employer or the Acquirer, provided that no other part or term of such merger would otherwise trigger a Change in Control, shall not constitute a Change in Control.
Acknowledgment; Effect on Change in Control Provisions
4. .
Amendments and Related Matters
(i) . Section 1 of the Employment Agreement shall be amended and restated as follows:
(a) Section 1 (Employment Period)
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as amended by that certain letter agreement entered into on October 30, 2006 between the Executive and the Employer and such other amendments previously entered into between the Executive and the Company (the "Amendments"), we agree to employ you, and you agree to be employed by us for a period (the "Employment Period") commencing on the Effective Time and expiring on the second anniversary thereof. In no event shall the Employment Period be subject to extension, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by the Executive and the Employer. After the expiration of the Employment Period, if not otherwise extended in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the Executive's employment with the Employer shall automatically continue on an "at-will" basis, and the Executive shall be subject to all of the obligations, and entitled to all of the rights, to which all other executives of the Employer who are "at-will" employees and hold positions and have responsibilities substantially equal in stature and seniority (in level, but not years of
 
service) to the Executive are subject or entitled (which, in any event, shall include, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Employer's or the Acquirer's plans and policies, (A) payment by the Employer of all Accrued Obligations, Accrued Welfare Benefits and Accrued Investments owed to the Executive at the time of termination of the Executive's employment under this Agreement (as amended by the Amendments) and (B) payment by the Employer of any accrued and earned but unpaid Annual Bonus in respect of any fiscal year during the Employment Period (whether or not the amount of any such Annual Bonus shall at the time of termination of the Executive's employment under this Agreement (as amended by the Amendments) be determined). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (as amended by the Amendments), after the expiration of the Employment Period, all of the Executive's obligations under this Agreement (as amended by the Amendments) shall terminate; provided, however, that (1) the Executive's obligations under Section 7 of this Agreement (as amended by the Amendments) shall continue with respect to Confidential Information obtained during the Employment Period, and (2) in the event that the Executive's employment continues on an "at-will" basis, the Executive shall enter into, promptly after the expiration of the Employment Period, the Employer's standard confidentiality agreement required to be signed upon hire by other executives of the Employer who hold positions and have responsibilities substantially equal in stature and seniority (in level, but not in years of service) as the Executive (which, for the avoidance of doubt does not include non-compete, non-solicit or similar restrictive covenants). For the avoidance of doubt, the Employer and the Executive hereby acknowledge that the Executive's "at-will" employment after the expiration of the Employment Period shall be terminable by either party upon such party's notice of such termination to the other party.
(b) . Section 2(a) of the Employment Agreement shall be amended to change the reference therein to the Executive's position to Group President of Asia Pacific Operations, EMEA Operations and D&I Operations. In addition, (i) at the Effective Time, the Executive shall be appointed to serve on the Employer's Global Executive Board (but only for as long and upon such terms as the Chief Executive Officer of the Employer shall from time to time determine in his sole discretion) and (ii) the Executive shall be appointed to fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors of the Acquirer, effective at the Effective Time and the Board of Directors of the Acquirer shall include the Executive's name on each slate of director nominees for election at an annual meeting of stockholders of the Acquirer during the Employment Period. If the Executive is serving as a member of the Board at the time the Period of Employment ends for any reason (whether by termination or expiration), the Executive shall promptly tender a letter of resignation for acceptance by the Board. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in such Section 2(a), your powers and duties shall be (1) acting with respect to the D&I Business (as defined below) in the same manner as, and having the same oversight role with respect to the D&I Business as, the Chief Executive Officer of the D&I Business, if operated as a stand-alone entity, would have, (2) serving as the executive to whom the heads of Asia Pacific Operations and EMEA Operations report and (3) such other duties as the Chief Executive Officer of the Employer shall reasonably request. As used herein, "D&I Business" means the business known as the Development and Investment Business within the Company prior to the Effective Time, which business will operate under the name of the Company from and after the Effective Time.
Section 2(a) (Position and Duties)
 
(c) . Section 2(b) of the Employment Agreement shall be amended and restated as follows:
Section 2(b) (Compensation)
(i) . For services during the Employment Period, you will receive an annual base salary (the "Annual Base Salary") at an initial rate of $600, 000, payable in accordance with the customary payroll practices of the Employer for its other executives. Such Annual Base Salary shall be subject to review in the same manner as the salaries are reviewed with respect to other executives of the Employer who hold positions and have responsibilities substantially equal in stature and seniority (in level, but not in years of service) to the Executive, but, during the Employment Period, in no event shall the Annual Base Salary be less than the initial rate set forth above. The term "Annual Base Salary" will refer to the Annual Base Salary as it may be so adjusted from time to time.
Annual Base Salary
(ii) . For services during the Employment Period, the Executive shall be eligible to receive such annual bonus payments, if any, as the Board (or its Compensation Committee) may specify (each an "Annual Bonus"); provided that for each Annual Bonus with respect to services performed during the Employment Period, (1) the "bonus target amount" for purposes of calculating such Annual Bonus shall be no less than $750, 000, (2) the manner for determining whether the Executive has met or exceeded the performance criteria applicable to such "bonus target amount" shall be made in accordance with the policies of the Employer generally applicable to other executives of the Employer similar in stature and seniority (in level, not in years) to the Executive, (3) whether the "bonus target amount" shall be met shall be determined 50% with respect to the results of the D&I Business and 50% with respect to the results of the EMEA and Asia Pacific operations, subject to such adjustment of the percentages as the Chief Executive Officer of the Employer and the Executive shall from time to time agree upon, and (4) for the avoidance of doubt, the applicable "bonus target amount" shall in no event be deemed to constitute a cap on the amount of the Annual Bonus to which the Executive is eligible to receive. Annual Bonuses earned by the Executive will be paid no later than the date bonuses are paid for other executives of the Employer, generally March of the year following the year in respect of which the bonus is granted, and will be payable to the Executive whether or not the Executive is employed by the Employer at the time of payment. In addition, the Executive shall be eligible to receive a one-time bonus (payable at the same time as the Annual Bonus payable in respect of fiscal year 2007 is payable) in an amount of up to $300,000, such amount to be determined in the Employer's Chief Executive Officer's sole discretion, in respect of his assistance in facilitating the D&I Business integration.
Annual Bonus
(iii) . The Executive shall be entitled to participate in all incentive, savings, stock option or other equity award, profit sharing and retirement plans, practices, policies and programs applicable generally to other executives of the Employer (the "Investment Plans"), subject to the terms and conditions of such Investment Plans. All Awards (and the terms thereof, including with respect to vesting schedules) granted during the Employment Period shall be determined, structured and awarded in the same manner and at the same time as determined, structured and awarded for other executives of the Employer who hold positions and have responsibilities substantially equal in stature and seniority (in level, but not years of service) to the Executive. In the event that the Effective Time occurs after the 2007 Awards are granted, the Executive shall receive such Award that he
Awards Under Investment Plans
 
otherwise would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the foregoing sentence the day that his employment commences.
(iv) . The Executive shall be eligible to participate in all health, life and disability insurance policies, all death and disability plans, practices, policies and programs and all other welfare benefit plans, practices, policies and programs applicable generally to other executives of the Employer ("Welfare Plans"), subject to the terms and conditions of such Welfare Plans.
Welfare Plans
(v) . The Employer shall provide the Executive with, or make available to the Executive, all perquisites that the Employer makes available or provides to other executives of the Employer who hold positions and have responsibilities substantially equal in stature and seniority (in level, but not years of service) to the Executive. In addition, the Acquirer will provide personal umbrella insurance coverage for the Executive of the same type provided by the Company for the Executive immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, the Employer may provide such coverage pursuant to a new policy with substantially similar terms and conditions and the same limits as the existing umbrella policy.
Perquisites
(d) . By way of clarification, the provisions of Section 2(c) of the Employment Agreement regarding the accelerated vesting of Awards upon the occurrence of a Change in Control shall apply (i) to all Awards held by the Executive immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger with respect to the Merger and (ii) to all Awards held by the Executive immediately prior to each subsequent Change in Control that occurs during the Employment Period
Section 2(c) (Vesting of Equity Awards)
(e) . The third sentence of Section 3(d) of the Employment Agreement shall be amended and restated in its entirety to provide as follows:
Section 3(d) (Resignation by You)
"Good Reason' means (A) any (1) material diminution (considering all previous diminutions during the Employment Period in the aggregate, including all previous diminutions occurring after the Effective Time which are not material when considered separately) in your position, authority, powers, functions, duties or responsibilities in effect at the Effective Time (as such duties are modified by the Amendments), except any termination of the Executive's membership on the Global Executive Board (for whatever reason) shall not constitute any such diminution or (2) the Executive is not appointed or nominated to the Acquirer's Board of Directors as set forth in Section 2(a) of this Agreement, (B) any failure by the Employer to comply with any of its payment obligations under this Agreement (as amended by the Amendments), and any failure by the Employer to comply with or failure to cause compliance with any of the provisions of Section 2(b) of this Agreement (as amended by the Amendments), (C) any change in the Executive's Base Salary, Annual Bonus or Awards not permitted to be made under this Agreement (as amended by the Amendments), (D) the relocation or transfer of your principal office to a location more than 50 miles from your regular work address as of the Effective Time without your consent, or (E) the failure of the Acquirer to meet any of its obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to compensation payable to the Executive in his capacity as an employee of the Company prior to the Effective Time.
 
For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of the Executive's membership on the Global Executive Board shall not constitute grounds for Good Reason termination.
(f) . As a result of the amendment set forth in Section 4(a) hereof, Section 3(e) of the Employment Agreement is hereby deleted.
Section 3(e) (Expiration of Term)
(g) . Section 4(d)(i) of the Employment Agreement shall be amended to provide that the term "Change in Control" shall have the meaning given to the term "Change of Control" in the Acquirer's Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Acquirer Plan"); provided, however, that for purposes of Section 4(d)(i) of the Employment Agreement, the definition of "Change of Control" in the Acquirer Plan shall be amended as follows:
Section 4(d)(i) (Definition of Change in Control)
(i) Section 2(e)(ii) shall be amended to provide that a Change of Control occurs upon the closing of any acquisition of assets of another entity in which the voting securities or then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company owned by the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition do not represent, after such acquisition more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power or the total number of shares of common stock then outstanding of the Company immediately after such acquisition; and
(ii) Section 2(e)(v) shall be amended to provided that a Change of Control occurs when a liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation has been approved by the stockholders of the Company.
Section 4(d)(i) of the Employment Agreement shall be further amended so that, to the extent that any event occurring with respect to the Employer would constitute a Change in Control, such event occurring with respect to the Acquirer shall also constitute a Change in Control. Furthermore, Section 4(d)(i) of the Employment Agreement shall be amended to delete the proviso therein. In addition, in the event that a Change in Control with respect to the D&I Business occurs, then, at the Executive's election, (A) the Employer shall cause its (or the then owner of the D&I Business') successor with respect to the D&I Business to succeed to the Acquirer as the Executive's employer on substantially the same terms set forth in the Employment Agreement (as amended by this Amendment) with respect to the remainder of the Employment Period, effective upon the effectiveness of such Change of Control, and the Employer shall no longer be the employer of the Executive or (B) the Executive's employment under the Employment Agreement shall continue pursuant to its terms, and reasonable accommodation shall be made for the Executive so that (other than with respect to his oversight of the D&I Business, his position, title and other rights and obligations under the Employment Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The failure of the Employer to satisfy the foregoing obligation shall constitute grounds for Good Reason termination by the Executive, subject to any applicable cure periods and, in addition to the other benefits due to the Executive upon such termination (and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Employment Agreement, the Amendments or the other policies or plans of the Employer or the Acquirer), all of his Awards that are unvested at the time of such termination shall be
 
accelerated in full. For purposes of this paragraph, a Change in Control with respect to the D&I Business shall be deemed to occur upon the occurrence of any event that, if it occurred with respect to the Employer or the Acquirer, would constitute a Change in Control, and shall also be deemed to occur upon the occurrence of any of the following events (whether or not such event would otherwise constitute a Change in Control of the D&I Business: (A) a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the D&I Business (wherever or by whomever such assets are held), (B) any "spin-off" of the D&I Business, or (C) a Change in Control with respect to any entity through which all or a substantial portion of the D&I Business is conducted, all or a substantial portion of the assets of the D&I Business are held or all or a substantial number of producer employees or executives performing services for the D&I Business are employed.
(h) .
Section 5(c) (Without Cause; Resignation for Good Reason; Non-Renewal Election by the Company)
(i) . Clause (y) in Section 5(c)(i) shall be amended and restated in its entirety to provide as follows: "an amount equal to the greater of (1) the highest "bonus target amount" applicable to you during the Employment Period or (2) $750, 000." In addition, the multiplier of three (3) referred to therein shall be reduced to two and one-half (2.5).
Section 5(c)(i) (Cash Payments)
(ii) . The first sentence of the last paragraph of Section 5(c) of the Employment Agreement shall be amended to change the reference therein to Awards granted on or after a Change in Control to Awards granted at any time from and after the Effective Time.
Last Paragraph (Date of Award Grant)
(i) . The reference to fifteen (15) months in the definition of "Term of Competition" is hereby changed to twelve (12) months.
Section 8 (Non-Compete)
(j) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Employment Agreement, all determinations to be made and actions to be taken by the Employer under the Employment Agreement (as amended by this Amendment) (whether directly or through its Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee thereof or any of its officers, directors or other employees) shall be made or taken by it in good faith and in the exercise of its reasonable judgment.
Determinations by the Employer
(k) . Solely for purposes of Section 5(e) of the Employment Agreement, the Merger shall not be deemed to constitute a Change in Control.
Section 5(e)
(l) . Each provision set forth in the Employment Agreement that provides the Executive with the same or similar rights or benefits to which members of the Executive Committee or other executive officers of the Company are entitled is hereby amended to provide the Executive with the same or similar rights or benefits to which other executives of the Employer who hold positions and have responsibilities substantially equal in stature and seniority (in level, but not years of service) to the Executive are entitled.
Executive Rights and Benefits
 
5. . In the event that the Acquirer takes any action or omits to take any action that, if taken or omitted to be taken by the Employer, would constitute a breach of any provision of the Employment Agreement (as amended by this Amendment), such act or omission shall nonetheless constitute a breach of such provision to the same extent as if such action was taken or omitted to be taken by the Employer.
Role of the Acquirer
6. . The Executive hereby waives his right to terminate his employment for Good Reason solely to the extent that grounds therefor arise as a result of the change in the terms of his employment set forth herein. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall such waiver constitute a waiver by the Executive of the Acquirer's failure to comply with or cause the compliance with the terms and conditions of the Employment Agreement, as amended by this Amendment, or for any other reason that constitutes "Good Reason."
Waiver
7. . All references contained in the Employment Agreement to accrued benefits, bonus, salary and other compensation that is payable upon certain terminations of the Executive's employment, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include all such amounts so accrued, whether or not they relate to periods prior to the Effective Time.
Prior Measurement Periods
8. . Except as specifically amended, acknowledged or supplemented in this Amendment, from and after the Effective Time, the Employment Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. In addition, and for the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a conflict between the terms of the Employer's or the Acquirer's plans and policies (including, without limitation, Investment Plans and bonus policies) and the terms of the Employment Agreement or this Amendment or the Restricted Stock Agreement referred to herein (by way of example, with respect to forfeiture and acceleration of Awards), the applicable terms of the Employment Agreement, this Amendment or the Restricted Stock Agreement shall govern and control.
Effect on Employment Agreement; Conflicts
9. . This Amendment may be executed (including by facsimile or electronic transmission) in any number of counterparts.
Counterparts
10. . THIS AMENDMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS WITHOUT REFERENCE TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS OF TEXAS OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES.
Governing Law
11. . This Amendment, together with the Exhibits hereto and the Employment Agreement, constitutes the sole understanding of the Employer and the Executive with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Entire Agreement
 
By signing and countersigning this Amendment in the appropriate space set forth below, the Executive and the Employer have agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth herein.

Exhibit 10.3
 
December 19, 2006
Robert E. Sulentic
6037 Lakehurst Avenue
Dallas, TX 75230
 
Dear Bob:
Robert E. Sulentic (the "Executive") and Trammell Crow Company (the "Company") are parties to that certain employment letter agreement dated as of October 17, 2003 (the "Original Agreement"), which sets forth the terms of the Executive's employment with the Company. On April 6, 2004 and October 17, 2005, the Executive and the Company amended the Original Agreement (the Original Agreement, as so amended, is hereinafter referred to as the "Employment Agreement").
Pursuant to a certain Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the Company, CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (the "Acquirer") and A-2 Acquisition Corp. (the "Acquisition Subsidiary"), the Acquisition Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") and, as a result of the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquirer. The effective time of the Merger is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time." C.B. Richard Ellis, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquirer, is hereinafter referred to as the "Employer."
In connection with the consummation of the Merger, the Employer and the Executive agreed to amend and supplement the Employment Agreement in certain respects as set forth in the letter agreement (the "First Amendment") between Employer and Executive dated October 30, 2006, which First Amendment is to become effective at, but not before, the Effective Time.
The Executive and Employer wish to amend the terms of Section 2(c) of the Agreement and Section 4(d) of the First Amendment as set forth in this letter (this "Second Amendment"). The Executive and the Employer acknowledge and agree that this Second Amendment is being entered into for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged. Each capitalized term used but not otherwise defined in this Amendment will have the meaning given to that term in the Employment Agreement and the First Amendment.
1. . The provisions set forth in Section 2 of this Second Amendment shall take effect at, but not before, the Effective Time. If the Merger Agreement is terminated
Effectiveness
before the Merger is consummated, upon such termination, this Second Amendment shall automatically terminate and be void .
ab initio
2. . Employer and Executive agree that Section 4(d) of the First Amendment is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows:
Vesting of Certain Equity Awards
The Employer and the Executive agree that, by way of clarification, and except as set forth in this paragraph, the accelerated vesting of Awards upon the occurrence of a Change in Control shall apply (i) to all Awards held by the Executive immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger with respect to the Merger and (ii) to all Awards held by the Executive immediately prior to each subsequent Change in Control that occurs during the Employment Period; provided, that, notwithstanding the terms of Section 2(c) of the Agreement, the Employer and Executive agree that:
(i) Vesting with respect to the 30,000 shares of restricted stock subject to an Award held by the Executive that, absent the occurrence of the Merger or some other acceleration event, would otherwise have vested on April 8, 2007, will not accelerate immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, but such shares shall vest in full on April 8, 2007, unless (A) the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or by the Executive for any reason other than Good Reason, and in either such case such shares would be forfeited by Executive or (B) any event occurs subsequent to the Merger that would otherwise cause the acceleration of the vesting of such shares, and in such case such shares would vest in full upon such acceleration event. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Employment Agreement, the First Amendment or any other policies or procedures of the Employer or the Acquirer, the only events upon which such shares will be forfeited prior to the vesting date is upon the occurrence of the events specified in clause (A) of this paragraph.
(ii) Vesting with respect to 27,000 shares of restricted stock subject to an Award held by the Executive that, absent the occurrence of the Merger or some other acceleration event, would otherwise have vested on April 8, 2008, will not accelerate immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, but such shares shall vest in full on July 1, 2007, unless (A) the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or by the Executive for any reason other than Good Reason, and in either such case such shares would be forfeited by Executive or (B) any event occurs subsequent to the Merger that would otherwise cause the acceleration of the vesting of such shares, and in such case such shares would vest in full upon such acceleration event. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Employment Agreement, the First Amendment or any other policies or procedures of the Employer or the Acquirer, the only events upon which such shares will be forfeited prior to the vesting date is upon the occurrence of the events specified in clause (A) of this paragraph. As used herein, the restricted stock awards referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 2 shall be referred to as the "Restricted Stock Award," and the date upon which the entire Restricted Stock Award shall be fully vested shall be referred to as the "Vesting Date."
 
3. . Section 6(a) of the Employment Agreement is hereby amended to change the cure period therein with respect to events described in the definition of Good Reason that occur on or prior to the Vesting Date from 60 days to 15 days.
Notice of Termination
4. . The definition of "Cause" set forth in Section 3(c) of the Employment Agreement is hereby amended in the following manner with respect to events described in such definition that occur on or prior to the Vesting Date:
Definition of Cause
    (i) Clause (i) of the definition shall be amended to provide as follows: "your continued failure to substantially perform your material obligations and duties under this Agreement (as amended by the Amendments), as determined in good faith by the Board, and which is not remedied in all material respects on or before the later to occur of (A) the business day immediately following the Vesting Date or (B) 30 days after your receipt of written notice thereof."
    (ii) Clause (ii) of the definition shall be amended to provide as follows: "your breach of fiduciary duty against the Company that is materially harmful to the Company, as determined in good faith by the Board."
    (iii) Clause (iii) of the definition shall be amended to delete the reference to Section 7 therein.
    (iv) Clause (v) of the definition shall be deleted.
5. .
