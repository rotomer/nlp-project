FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Los Angeles, CA  February 6, 2007  CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today reported revenue of $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 36.5% over the fourth quarter of 2005, and diluted earnings per share of $0.53 for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with $0.41 for the same quarter last year.  Excluding one-time charges(1), fourth quarter 2006 diluted earnings per share was $0.57, an increase of 32.6% from the $0.43 earned in the fourth quarter of 2005.
These results include operations of the newly acquired Trammell Crow Company for the period December 20, 2006 through December 31, 2006.  Excluding one-time items, the impact from the acquisition on quarterly results was negligible.
Fourth Quarter Highlights
For the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company generated revenue of $1.4 billion, up 36.5% over the $1.0 billion posted in the fourth quarter of 2005.  The Company reported net income of $125.1 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with net income of $95.4 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Excluding one-time items, the Company would have earned net income(2)
of $134.2 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of 34.3% and 32.6%, respectively, compared with net income of $99.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)
(3) totaled $260.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of $74.2 million, or 39.8%, from the same quarter last year.

The Company's fourth quarter results continue to reflect strong performance across virtually all business lines and geographies, as well as contributions from acquisitions.  Of the 36.5% revenue growth, nearly three-fourths was due to organic growth with the remainder attributable to acquisitions completed in 2006. This marks the 17
th
 straight quarter of double-digit year-over-year organic revenue growth.  The organic growth was fueled by strong leasing activity in most major markets, continued strength in investment sales, especially overseas, as well as increased revenue in the appraisal/valuation, mortgage brokerage, and property and facilities management operations.  In addition, global investment management operations showed robust revenue growth.
The Company has reclassified certain reimbursements (primarily salaries and related costs) related to its facilities and property management operations from cost of services to revenue.  In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company reclassified $72.7 million and $76.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and $275.3 million and $283.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  This reclassification has no impact on operating income, EBITDA, net income or earnings per share.
Full Year Results
Revenue was $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, up $838.0 million, or 26.2%, compared to the same period last year.  Over two-thirds of the improvement was due to organic growth, while acquisitions completed in 2005 and 2006 drove the remainder of the revenue increase.  The Company reported net income of $318.6 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to net income of $217.3 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
Excluding one-time items, the Company would have earned net income of $348.0 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2006, up 51.4% and 48.0%, respectively, over net income of $229.9 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2005.
EBITDA was $653.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, up $199.3 million or 43.9% compared to the same period last year.
Management's Commentary
"Our performance in 2006 is the result of the powerful client-focused platform we have built and continue to enhance, which has resulted in the creation of the premier global commercial real estate services firm," said Brett White, president and chief executive officer of CB Richard Ellis.  "Our primary markets remain strong.  Worldwide economic expansion and increased employment rolls have produced strong demand for commercial space. Rental growth is accelerating as market fundamentals continue to improve while new construction remains limited.  Commercial real estate continues to be a magnet for institutional and private-equity capital, especially in high-growth markets in Asia and traditional business centers like New York, London and Paris.  Cross-border investment flows, in particular, have reached new highs.

"We are ideally positioned to take advantage of macro trends in the marketplace, due to our global footprint, broad service offering, collaborative culture and leading position in virtually every major business center worldwide.  The exceptional talent, resources, and relationships we have added with our new Trammell Crow Company operations have materially enhanced the depth and breadth of our service offering. We enter 2007 a stronger company poised for continued growth."
Fourth-Quarter Segment Highlights
Americas Region
Fourth quarter revenue for the Americas region, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Latin America, increased 18.0% to $ 791.0 million, compared with $670.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2005.  Approximately two-thirds of the improvement was due to organic growth, while acquisitions completed in 2006 drove the remainder of the revenue increase.  The organic growth was mainly attributable to a continued improving leasing trend, higher mortgage brokerage, appraisal/valuation and property and facilities management fees, as well as slightly increased sales activity.
Operating income for the Americas region totaled $88.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with $75.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2005.  Excluding the impact of one-time items, operating income for the Americas region would have been $95.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of $19.3 million, or 25.2%, as compared to $76.6 million for the fourth quarter of last year.  The Americas region's EBITDA totaled $115.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of $26.6 million, or 30.0%, from last year's fourth quarter.
EMEA Region
Revenue for the EMEA region, mainly consisting of operations in Europe, increased 46.4% to $362.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with $247.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2005.  This revenue increase was largely organic and primarily driven by strong performance in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland and Belgium attributable to significantly increased transaction revenues as well as higher appraisal/valuation activities.
Operating income for the EMEA segment totaled $91.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with $56.9 million for the same period last year.   Excluding the impact of one-time items, operating income for the EMEA region would have been $91.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of $35.0 million, or 61.5%, from the fourth quarter of last year.  EBITDA for the EMEA region totaled $95.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of $35.2 million, or 58.2%, from last year's fourth quarter.
Asia Pacific Region
In the Asia Pacific region, which includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, revenue totaled $117.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, a 101.7% increase from $58.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2005.  The Company's acquisition of a majority interest in its affiliate in Japan in January 2006 accounted for almost two-thirds of the
3
revenue increase, with the remainder primarily coming from organic growth throughout the region.
Operating income for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $22.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of 120.9% as compared to $10.0 million for the same period last year.  EBITDA for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $20.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of $9.5 million, or 85.3%, from last year's fourth quarter.
Global Investment Management Business
In the Global Investment Management segment, which consists of investment management operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, revenue totaled $129.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, a 129.1% increase from the $56.4 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005.  This increase was mainly due to carried interest revenue earned as well as higher asset management fees in the U.S. and the U.K.  Assets under management grew to $28.6 billion as of the end of the fourth quarter, up $11.3 billion, or 65.3%, from year-end 2005.
This segment reported operating income of $25.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with operating income of $16.3 million for the same period last year, an increase of 53.3%. The improved performance was mainly attributable to the aforementioned increase in asset management fees.  While revenue recognized from funds liquidating (carried interest revenue) increased by $54.8 million, it was offset by $52.7 million of higher incentive compensation expense recognized for dedicated executives and team leaders associated with this segment's carried interest programs.
For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded a total of $91.1 million of incentive compensation expense related to carried interest revenue, only $40.9 million of which pertained to revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2006 with the remainder relating to future periods' revenue.  Revenues associated with these expenses cannot be recognized until certain contractual hurdles are met.  The Company expects that it will recognize income from funds liquidating in future quarters that will more than offset accrued incentive compensation expense recognized.
EBITDA for this segment totaled $27.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of 3.4% from last year's fourth quarter.  The improvement in operating performance was partially offset by a decrease in equity earnings, which is included in the calculation of EBITDA but not in the calculation of operating income.  Equity earnings were higher last year as a result of dispositions in the fourth quarter of 2005 within select funds.
The Global Investment Management segment did not incur any one-time costs in the current or prior year quarter.
Development Services
The Development Services segment consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the U.S. acquired with the Trammell Crow Company on December 20, 2006.  This segment includes activity from the acquisition date through December 31, 2006, including revenue of $8.8 million.
4
This segment generated an operating loss of $3.1 million.  Excluding the impact of one-time items, the operating loss translates into operating income of $2.5 million.  EBITDA for this segment totaled $2.0 million.
Development projects in process as of year-end 2006 totaled $5.4 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion, or 50% from year-end 2005. In addition, there was $3.0 billion of development projects in the pipeline at year-end 2006.
Guidance
In 2007, as compared to 2006 performance, CB Richard Ellis expects to generate full year diluted earnings per share growth in the range of 25% to 30%, excluding one-time charges.

(1) One-time charges include amortization expense related to net revenue backlog and incentive fees acquired, integration costs related to acquisitions, loss on extinguishment of debt, income related to investment in Savills plc (disposed of in January 2007) and tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

()The Company's management believes that EBITDA is useful in evaluating its performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.  As a result, the Company's management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the performance of various business lines and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring its performance under its employee incentive programs.
3
However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and when analyzing the Company's operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income determined in accordance with GAAP.  Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.  The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
For a reconciliation of EBITDA with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."

Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company's management reclassified such reimbursements from cost of services to revenue for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005 to be consistent with the presentation for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006.  In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company reclassified $72.7 million and $76.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively and $275.3 million and $283.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The following measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC guidelines:
Net income, as adjusted for one-time items

Operating income (loss), as adjusted for one-time items
(iv)
                             
The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of current results to prior periods as well as presenting the effects of one-time items in all periods presented.  The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of one-time items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of its business.
