FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
For further information:
 
, first quarter 2007 diluted earnings per share was $0.27, an increase of 58.8% from the $0.17 earned in the first quarter of 2006, despite the $28.0 million increase in interest expense that was driven by the debt incurred to finance the Trammell Crow Company acquisition at the end of 2006 and the exclusion of $8.5 million of gains from Development Services in the first quarter of 2007, the recognition of which was impacted by purchase accounting.
Los Angeles, CA  May 1, 2007  CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today reported revenue of $1.2 billion for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of 61.6% over the first quarter of 2006, and diluted earnings per share of $0.05 for the first quarter of 2007, compared with $0.16 for the same quarter last year.  Excluding one-time charges

First Quarter Highlights
For the first quarter of 2007, the Company generated revenue of $1.2 billion, up 61.6% over the $751.3 million posted in the first quarter of 2006.  The Company reported net income of $12.0 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2007 compared with net income of $36.9 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2006.
Excluding one-time items, the Company would have earned net income(2) of $65.0 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2007, an increase of 62.2% and 58.8%, respectively, compared with net income of $40.1 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2006.
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)(
totaled $84.3 million for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of $1.6 million, or 2.0%, from the same quarter last year despite the inclusion of $77.6(
3)
million of acquisition-related expenses.
4)
The Company's first quarter results continue to reflect strong performance across virtually all business lines and geographies, as well as contributions from acquisitions.  Of the 61.6% revenue growth, over one-half was organic with the remainder attributable to
acquisitions completed in 2006, particularly the acquisition of Trammell Crow Company in December 2006. This marks the 18
th
 straight quarter of double-digit year-over-year organic revenue growth.  The growth was fueled by overall strength in investment management, Europe and Asia Pacific, capital markets in the Americas, and property and facilities management operations.
The integration of Trammell Crow Company is going extremely well and is ahead of schedule with regard to timing and attainment of synergy savings, which are now expected to exceed the Company's initial targets.
In January 2007, the Company sold Trammell Crow Company's approximately 19% ownership interest in Savills, plc, a real estate provider in the United Kingdom.  This sale resulted in a non-cash, pre-tax loss of $34.9 million in the first quarter of 2007, which was largely driven by stock price depreciation at the date of sale as compared to December 31, 2006 when the investment was marked to market.  The pre-tax proceeds from this sale, net of selling expenses, of approximately $311.0 million has been used to reduce net indebtedness.
Management's Commentary
"For the past 18 quarters, the Company has been the acknowledged market leader in most major business centers worldwide," said Brett White, President and Chief Executive Officer of CB Richard Ellis.  "This dominant geographic footprint coupled with the industry's most extensive offering of client services and business lines, has allowed us to leverage a favorable global marketplace into exceptionally strong financial growth.  The first quarter of 2007 was no exception to this long term trend.  In addition, we are just now beginning to experience the revenue synergy of the Trammell Crow Company integration, which is translating into the acquisition of significant new corporate services clientele.
"Our first quarter results were bolstered by extremely strong growth in EMEA, Asia Pacific and the growth and timing of our Global Investment Management revenues, most notably the recognition of certain carried interests.  Based upon these factors and the continuing favorable global marketplace for our services, our bias for full year 2007 results is at the upper end of our previously discussed earnings guidance range."
First-Quarter Segment Highlights
Americas Region
First quarter revenue for the Americas region, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Latin America, increased 60.5% to $791.9 million, compared with $493.3 million for the first quarter of 2006.  Approximately one-fifth of the improvement was due to organic growth, while the remainder of the revenue increase was driven by acquisitions, particularly the Trammell Crow Company acquisition.  The organic growth reflects increased sales activity as well as higher appraisal/valuation, mortgage brokerage and property and facilities management fees as the Company increased services provided to existing clients, while also growing market share.
Operating income for the Americas region totaled $21.6 million for the first quarter of 2007, compared with $43.5 million for the first quarter of 2006.  Excluding the impact of
2
one-time items, operating income for the Americas region would have been $74.5 million for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of $30.2 million, or 68.0%, as compared to $44.3 million for the first quarter of last year.  The Americas region's EBITDA totaled $7.1 million for the first quarter of 2007, a decrease of $47.4 million from last year's first quarter due to the inclusion of $77.1 million of acquisition-related expenses.
EMEA Region
Revenue for the EMEA region, mainly consisting of operations in Europe, increased 36.8% to $225.4 million for the first quarter of 2007, compared with $164.7 million for the first quarter of 2006.  Over three-fourths of the increase was organic, with the remainder attributable to acquisitions completed in 2006.  The organic growth was primarily driven by very strong performance in the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany.
Operating income for the EMEA segment totaled $33.6 million for the first quarter of 2007, compared with $14.0 million for the same period last year.   Excluding the impact of one-time items, operating income for the EMEA region would have been $34.2 million for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of $16.5 million, or 93.0%, from the first quarter of last year.  EBITDA for the EMEA region totaled $36.8 million for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of $17.4 million, or 89.4%, from last year's first quarter.
Asia Pacific Region
In the Asia Pacific region, which includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, revenue totaled $94.0 million for the first quarter of 2007, a 49.6% increase from $62.8 million for the first quarter of 2006.  This revenue increase was largely organic and was primarily driven by improved performance in Australia, Singapore and Japan.
Operating income for the Asia Pacific segment improved significantly to $9.9 million for the first quarter of 2007 compared to $0.7 million for the same period last year.  EBITDA for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $9.5 million for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of $7.4 million, or 352.7%, from last year's first quarter.
The Asia Pacific segment did not incur any one-time costs in the current or prior year quarter.
Global Investment Management Business
In the Global Investment Management segment, which consists of investment management operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, revenue totaled $85.6 million for the first quarter of 2007, a 181.6% increase from the $30.4 million recorded in the first quarter of 2006.  This increase was mainly due to higher carried interest revenue earned as well as increased asset management fees in the U.S. and the U.K.  Assets under management grew to $30.6 billion as of the end of the first quarter, up $2.0 billion, or 7.0%, from year-end 2006.
This segment reported operating income of $38.7 million for the first quarter of 2007, compared with operating income of $1.4 million for the same period last year.  EBITDA for this segment totaled $38.9 million for the first quarter of 2007, an increase of $32.3 million, or 489.8%, from last year's first quarter.  The improved performance was mainly attributable to the aforementioned increase in carried interest revenue and asset
3
management fees.  As compared with the prior year first quarter, revenue recognized from funds liquidating (carried interest revenue) increased by $41.5 million; however, it was partially offset by $7.3 million of higher incentive compensation expense recognized for dedicated executives and team leaders associated with this segment's carried interest programs.
For the first quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a total of $16.7 million of incentive compensation expense related to carried interest revenue, only $12.3 million of which pertained to revenue recognized during the first quarter of 2007 with the remainder relating to future periods' revenue.  Revenues associated with these expenses cannot be recognized until certain contractual hurdles are met.  The Company expects that it will recognize income from funds liquidating in future quarters that will more than offset the additional $4.4 million of incentive compensation expense recognized.
The Global Investment Management segment did not incur any one-time costs in the current or prior year quarter.
Development Services
The Development Services segment consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the U.S. acquired with the Trammell Crow Company on December 20, 2006.  Revenue for this segment totaled $17.1 million for the first quarter of 2007.
This segment generated an operating loss of $10.7 million for the first quarter of 2007.  Excluding the impact of one-time items, the operating loss would have been $9.5 million.  EBITDA for this segment was a loss of $8.0 million for the first quarter of 2007.  The losses incurred in this segment were largely a result of purchase accounting for the Trammell Crow Company acquisition, which dictates the write-up of assets to fair value upon acquisition, thereby eliminating any gains in the near term.  Excluding the impact of purchase accounting, the Company's earnings would have increased by approximately $8.5 million from net gains on real estate sold during the first quarter of 2007.
Development projects in process as of March 31, 2007 totaled $5.5 billion, a slight increase from year-end 2006. The inventory of pipeline deals as of March 31, 2007 stood at $2.9 billion.  The combined total of $8.4 billion of in-process and pipeline activity remains consistent with the strong levels at year-end 2006.

The Company's management believes that EBITDA is useful in evaluating its performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.  As a result, the Company's management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the performance of various business lines and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring its performance under its employee incentive programs.
3
However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and when analyzing the Company's operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition
5
to, and not as an alternative for, net income determined in accordance with GAAP.  Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.  The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
For a reconciliation of EBITDA with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
Includes the loss on sale of trading securities acquired in the Trammell Crow Company acquisition of $33.6 million, merger-related charges associated with the Trammell Crow Company acquisition of $31.9 million and integration costs related to acquisitions of $12.1 million, the majority of which related to the Trammell Crow Company acquisition.

Pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 01-14, "," and EITF 99-19 "," the Company's management concluded that certain reimbursements (primarily salaries and related costs) related to its facilities and property management operations were more appropriately accounted for on a grossed up basis versus a net expense basis.  Accordingly, the Company's management reclassified such reimbursements from cost of services to revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2006 to be consistent with the presentation for the three months ended March 31, 2007.  These reimbursements totaled $71.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006.   This reclassification had no impact on operating income, EBITDA, net income or earnings per share.

Operating income (loss), as adjusted for one-time items
(iv)
                             
The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of current results to prior periods as well as presenting the effects of one-time items in all periods presented.  The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of one-time items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of its business.
