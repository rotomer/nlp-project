FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Los Angeles, CA  February 5, 2008  CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today reported full year 2007 revenue rose 49.7% to $6.0 billion and earnings per share increased 23.0% to $1.66 per diluted share  both record levels for the Company.   Fourth quarter 2007 revenue increased 30.4% to $1.8 billion and diluted earnings per share increased slightly to $0.54 compared to the fourth quarter of 2006.  Excluding one-time charges(1), full year diluted earnings per share was $2.11, an increase of 42.6% from 2006 and fourth quarter 2007 diluted earnings per share was $0.63, representing an increase of 10.5% from the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
The full year earnings growth was achieved despite a $118.0 million increase in interest expense associated with the financing of the Trammell Crow Company acquisition and the exclusion of $61.6 million of gains from Development Services activities, which cannot be recognized under purchase accounting rules.  The fourth quarter impact of interest expense and development service gains exclusions were $28.2 million and $40.6 million, respectively.
 
Management's Commentary
"We're very proud of our performance in 2007.  By providing exceptional service to our clients on a daily basis, we were able to deliver record results across all of our geographies and business segments.  Our performance was especially strong over the first nine months of 2007 but moderated later in the year.  Fourth quarter results were impacted by the softer investment sales environment brought about by the continuing difficulties in the credit markets, as well as a reduced rate of growth for leasing due to the weaker economies in the U.S. and the U.K.," said Brett White, President and Chief Executive Officer of CB Richard Ellis.  "Additionally, our Global Investment Management business, which had a remarkable 2007, had a slower fourth quarter primarily due to the timing of carried interest revenue recognition.  Despite
 
all of this, our overall fourth quarter performance was quite good.  Our strategic moves to diversify our business base continued to pay dividends. Revenue from outsourcing operations  fortified by the Trammell Crow Company acquisition  increased 150% during the quarter and now represents 23% of global revenues compared with 12% in the fourth quarter of 2006.  In Asia-Pacific, we continue to see strong sales and leasing growth.
 
"While the macro environment in which we operate has continued to weaken, underlying real estate market fundamentals remain strong and are generally characterized by low vacancies, modestly rising rents and rational levels of new construction. Traditionally, we have taken advantage of such market slowdowns to build market share and strengthen our platform and we expect to do so during these times as well."
 
Reflecting the growth of its outsourcing operations, CB Richard Ellis added 26 new corporate services accounts, expanded its service offering with 18 existing corporate clients, and renewed its relationship with 17 others during 2007.  Recent notable account additions and expansions/renewals in our corporate outsourcing business include AT&T, Oracle Corporation, the McGraw-Hill Companies, The Nielsen Company and International Automotive Components Group.
 
Full Year Results
Revenue was $6.0 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, up $2.0 billion, or 49.7%, compared to the same period last year.  The Company reported net income of $390.5 million, or $1.66 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 compared to net income of $318.6 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, in the same period last year.

Excluding one-time items, the Company would have earned net income(

was $834.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, up $180.7 million or 27.7% compared to the same period last year despite the inclusion of $135.7 million(4) of acquisition-related expenses.
 
The strong earnings growth was achieved despite a $118.0 million increase in interest expense associated with the financing of the Trammell Crow Company acquisition and the exclusion of $61.6 million of gains from Development Services activities, which cannot be recognized under purchase accounting rules.
 
Fourth Quarter Highlights
For the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company generated revenue of $1.8 billion, up 30.4% over the $1.4 billion posted in the fourth quarter of 2006.  The Company reported net income of $122.4 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared with net income of $125.1 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
 
Excluding one-time items, the Company would have earned net income of $144.3 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase of 7.5% and 10.5%, respectively, compared with net income of $134.2 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 
(5)
EBITDA totaled $257.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, a slight decrease from the same quarter last year largely due to the inclusion of $28.0 million
of acquisition-related expenses and the exclusion of $40.6 million of gains from Development Services activities, which cannot be recognized under purchase accounting rules.
 
The integration of Trammell Crow Company is complete and the Company realized net expense synergy savings of $90 million, surpassing original expectations of $65 million.  These savings will be reflected in full during the 2008 calendar year.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company completed its previously announced share repurchase program by acquiring 28.8 million shares for $635.0 million at an average price of $22.03.
 
Fourth-Quarter Segment Results
 
Americas Region
Fourth quarter revenue for the Americas region, including the U.S., Canada and Latin America, increased 32.6% to $1.0 billion, compared with $791.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2006.  This increase was mostly attributable to the growth of our outsourcing revenues as well as stronger leasing performance, albeit at a slower rate of growth than earlier in 2007.
 
Operating income for the Americas region totaled $93.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $88.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2006.  Excluding the impact of one-time items, operating income for the Americas region would have been $129.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase of $33.3 million, or 34.7%, as compared to $95.9 million for the fourth quarter of last year.  The Americas region's EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2007 remained even with the prior year quarter at $115.1 million as a result of the inclusion of $26.8 million(6) of acquisition-related expenses in the current year quarter.
 
EMEA Region
Revenue for the EMEA region increased 20.7% to $437.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $362.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2006.  This revenue increase reflects the continued strength of the Company's platform across most business lines and countries, including France, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Russia, Germany and the United Kingdom.
 
Operating income for the EMEA segment totaled $87.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $91.4 million for the same period last year.   EBITDA for the EMEA region totaled $88.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $95.5 million for last year's fourth quarter.  The current year quarter's lower operating income and EBITDA is mainly due to non-recurring payroll and payroll-related charges incurred in the United Kingdom.  It should also be noted that of the revenue increase approximately $30.0 million
 
was due to higher reimbursements associated with our property and facilities management contracts that are included in revenue with a corresponding increase in reimbursable expenses, which therefore does not translate into increased operating income or EBITDA.
 
Asia Pacific Region
In the Asia Pacific region, which includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, revenue totaled $198.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, a 68.6% increase from $117.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2006.  This revenue increase was primarily driven by improved performance in Australia, China, Singapore and Japan as well as from our acquisition of a majority interest in CBRE India in 2007.
 
Operating income for the Asia Pacific segment increased to $32.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $22.0 million for the same period last year.  EBITDA for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $31.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase of $10.5 million, or 50.6%, from last year's fourth quarter.
 
The Asia Pacific segment did not incur any significant one-time costs in the current or prior year quarter.
 
Global Investment Management Business
In the Global Investment Management segment, which consists of investment management operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, revenue totaled $79.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $129.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006.  This decrease was mainly due to lower carried interest revenue earned in the current year, partially offset by higher investment management and incentive fees, sources of annuity-like revenue.  Total assets under management have grown 32.2% from year-end 2006 to $37.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.
 
This segment reported operating income of $4.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $25.1 million for the same period last year.  EBITDA for this segment totaled $9.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared with $27.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.  The lower results were mainly attributable to the impact of carried interest activity.  As compared with the prior year fourth quarter, revenue recognized from funds liquidating (carried interest revenue) decreased by $75.7 million.  Most of the carried interest revenue for 2007of $88.7 million had already been recognized prior to the fourth quarter.  A partial offsetting factor was that carried interest incentive compensation expense was lower than the prior year by $52.6 million.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recorded a total of $62.7 million of incentive compensation expense related to carried interest revenue, only $19.8 million of which pertained to revenue recognized during 2007 with the remainder relating to future periods' revenue.  Revenues associated with these expenses cannot be recognized until certain contractual hurdles are met.  The Company expects that it will recognize income from funds liquidating in future quarters that will more than offset the additional $42.9 million of incentive compensation expense recognized.
 
The Global Investment Management segment did not incur any one-time costs in the current or prior year quarter.
 
Development Services
The Development Services segment consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the U.S. acquired with the Trammell Crow Company in December 2006.  The results for the fourth quarter of 2006 only include activity from December 20, 2006, the acquisition date, through December 31, 2006.  Revenue for this segment totaled $72.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
This segment reported an operating loss of $25.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2007.  Excluding the impact of one-time items, the operating loss would have been $23.4 million.  EBITDA for this segment totaled $13.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2007.  The difference primarily reflects the impact of equity earnings as well as activity classified as "discontinued operations", which are included in the calculation of EBITDA, but not in the calculation of operating loss.  Excluding the impact of purchase accounting, the Company's fourth quarter 2007 earnings would have increased by approximately $40.6 million from net gains on real estate sold during the quarter.
 
Development projects in process as of December 31, 2007 totaled $6.5 billion, a 19.9% increase from year-end 2006. The inventory of pipeline deals as of December 31, 2007 stood at $2.7 billion.

()The Company's management believes that EBITDA is useful in evaluating its performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.  As a result, the Company's management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the performance of various business lines and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring its performance under its employee incentive programs.

However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and when analyzing the Company's operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income determined in accordance with GAAP.  Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.  The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
 
For a reconciliation of EBITDA with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
