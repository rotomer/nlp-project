(e)           On March 24, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Company's 2007 Executive Bonus Plan, or EBP.  Under the amendment, the 2008 financial-based measure for determining the annual performance awards of the regional presidents covered by the EBP will be based 50% on a global EBITDA target and 50% on their respective regional EBITDA targets.  EBITDA means earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Previously, 100% of the financial-based measure for these officers' annual performance awards was based on their respective regional EBITDA target.  The executives this amendment will impact in 2008 are Calvin W. Frese, Jr., PresidentAmericas and Rob Blain, PresidentAsia Pacific.  These financial measures and targets will be discussed more fully in the proxy statement to be sent to stockholders in connection with the Company's 2008 Annual Stockholders Meeting.
