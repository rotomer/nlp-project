FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Los Angeles, CA  February 10, 2009  CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today reported full year 2008 revenue of $5.1 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.39.   For the fourth quarter of 2008, revenue was $1.3 billion and diluted earnings per share was $0.03.  These diluted earnings per share amounts do not include the impact of significant, pending, non-cash goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible asset impairments that are discussed later in this press release.
 
1), diluted earnings per share was $0.97 for the full year and $0.37 for the fourth quarter.

Management's Commentary
 
"The strength of our people and platform enabled us to gain new clients and build market share across the business in 2008, despite extremely challenging global economic conditions," said Brett White, president and chief executive officer of CB Richard Ellis. "To better position CBRE for long term success, we have strategically diversified our revenue mix in the last few years with significantly increased contributions from fee-based outsourcing services and have moved decisively to eliminate fixed costs and improve operational efficiencies. For 2008, these moves enabled us to remain profitable and achieve the third-highest normalized EBITDA in our history in the face of  very tough commercial real estate market conditions.  However, the credit crunch and global economic weakness pose serious challenges for our industry in 2009, and as such, we will continue to manage our business carefully to sustain profitability in a market where property sales and leasing activity remains highly constrained."
 
The growth in fee-based outsourcing services was reflected in 33 new corporate outsourcing contracts secured in 2008 and the expansion of services for 32 existing customers. In addition, our market-leading property and corporate facilities management portfolio expanded by approximately 250 million square feet during the year. Full year 2008 revenue from this business
 
line accounted for more than one-third of global revenue  up from approximately 23% in the prior year.
 
The Company also improved its market share in a number of markets around the globe.  For example, CB Richard Ellis was the number one leasing agent in London during 2008, responsible for approximately 26% of all market activity  increased from approximately 16% in 2007.  In the U.S. investment sales market, the Company claimed a 17.9% market share in 2008 compared with 16.1% in 2007, according to Real Capital Analytics. This growth is emblematic of the Company's ability to increase its position in an overall weak market.
 
Management has worked diligently to remove significant operating expense from the Company's business model in order to better align costs with lower revenue opportunities in the current market.  To date, the Company has taken actions to eliminate a total of approximately $385 million of annual run-rate expenses for 2009 including the previously announced $190 million of expense savings.  These amounts are exclusive of variable compensation reductions due to lower transaction revenue.
 
In addition, the Company moved aggressively to reduce net debt(2) by approximately 14%, or $305.8 million, as of December 31, 2008 compared with September 30, 2008.  This was accomplished with the net proceeds from an equity offering of $207.8 million and cash flow from operations.
 
Full Year Results
 
Revenue was $5.1 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, compared with $6.0 billion for the same period last year.  Net income for the full year totaled $83.9 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared with net income of $390.5 million, or $1.66 per diluted share, in the same period last year.
 
Excluding one-time charges, the Company would have earned net income(3) of $208.7 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, compared with net income of $496.8 million, or $2.11 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007.
 
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)(4) was $457.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, including $144.2 million(5) of one-time charges, compared with $834.3 million in the same period last year, which included $135.8 million(6) of one-time charges.
 
Fourth Quarter Highlights
 
For the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company generated revenue of $1.3 billion compared with $1.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2007.  Net income totaled $6.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with net income of $122.4 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the same quarter last year.
 
EBITDA totaled
Excluding one-time charges, the Company would have earned net income of $87.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with net income of $144.3 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007. 
 
$121.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, including $101.7(7) million of one-time charges, compared with $257.9 million for the same quarter last year, which included $27.9 million(8) of one-time charges.
 
asset impairments in both of these segments.  These factors were partially mitigated by the continued growth in the outsourcing business as well as lower compensation expense and savings realized through cost reduction efforts.
Results during the quarter were impacted, as expected, by weak sales and leasing activity caused by the credit crunch and global economic downturn. Significant capital market turmoil also adversely affected incentive-based revenue within the Global Investment Management business and reduced real estate sales volume and values in the Development Services segment. It also caused
 
Fourth-Quarter Segment Results
 
Americas Region
 
Fourth-quarter revenue for the Americas region, including the U.S., Canada and Latin America, was $824.6 million, compared with $1.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2007.  The continued growth of the outsourcing business only partially offset weaker sales, leasing, appraisal and commercial mortgage brokerage activity.
 
Operating income for the Americas region totaled $115.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with $93.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2007.  The Americas region's EBITDA totaled $133.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of 16.2%, from $115.1 million in last year's fourth quarter.  Excluding the impact of one-time items, operating income for the Americas region would have totaled $129.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, which is consistent with the $129.2 million reported in the fourth quarter of last year.  The Company's ability to maintain profitability despite declining revenues reflects the success of its cost containment measures as well as lower compensation expense tied to reduced transaction activity.
 
EMEA Region
 
Revenue for the EMEA region, which mainly consists of operations in Europe, totaled $266.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with $437.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
Operating income for the EMEA segment totaled $35.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with $87.1 million for the same period last year.   Excluding the impact of one-time items, operating income for the EMEA region would have totaled $44.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, as compared to $88.1 million for the fourth quarter of last year.  EBITDA for the EMEA region totaled $39.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $88.6 million for last year's fourth quarter.
 
The current year's fourth quarter results reflect lower transaction revenue and a shift in the revenue mix from higher margin investment sales and leasing to outsourcing.  This effect was partially offset by lower compensation expense and savings realized through cost reduction efforts.
Asia Pacific Region
 
In the Asia Pacific region, which includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, revenue totaled $123.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with $198.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2007.
 
Operating income for the Asia Pacific segment was $2.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $32.3 million for the same period last year.  Excluding the impact of one-time items, operating income for this region would have totaled $7.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, versus $32.4 million for the fourth quarter of last year.  EBITDA for the Asia Pacific segment totaled $3.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $31.1 million for last year's fourth quarter.
 
The current year's fourth quarter results mainly reflect lower transaction revenue and a shift in revenue mix from higher margin investment sales to outsourcing activities.  This effect was partially offset by lower compensation expense and savings realized through cost reduction efforts.
 
Global Investment Management Business
 
In the Global Investment Management segment, which consists of investment management operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, revenue totaled $39.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with $79.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.  The Company did not recognize any revenue from fund liquidations (carried interest revenue) in the fourth quarter of 2008, but realized $7.2 million of such revenue in last year's fourth quarter.   Operating income improved significantly to $17.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 from $4.7 million for the same period last year.  This was largely due to a reversal of $25.8 million of previously-accrued carried interest incentive compensation expense in the current year quarter.  EBITDA for this segment was a loss of $10.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with positive EBITDA of $9.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.  This decrease was driven by the net non-cash write-down of investments of $24.6 million attributable to decreased market valuations, which are included in the calculation of EBITDA, but not operating income.
 
Total assets under management decreased by 6% during the quarter primarily due to valuation declines in the global portfolio as well as currency fluctuations.  At $38.5 billion, assets under management are up slightly from year end 2007, reflecting active fundraising efforts and acquisition programs.
 
Development Services
 
In the Development Services segment, which consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the U.S., revenue totaled $29.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $72.6 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007.  This revenue decrease was primarily driven by construction revenue, which also led to a corresponding decrease in construction job costs, thereby not translating into decreased operating income or EBITDA.
 
This segment reported an operating loss of $65.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with an operating loss of $25.1 million for the same period last year.  EBITDA was a loss of $45.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with positive EBITDA
 
of $13.2 million in last year's fourth quarter.  The lower results were attributable to $49.2 million in net non-cash write-downs of real estate assets recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Excluding the impact of one-time items, the operating loss would have totaled $2.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, as compared to an operating loss of $23.4 million for the fourth quarter of last year.  The improvement over the prior year primarily reflects lower compensation expense and savings realized through cost reduction efforts.  In addition, results for the fourth quarter of 2007 were significantly impacted by purchase accounting rules.
 
Development projects in process as of December 31, 2008 totaled $5.6 billion compared to $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2007. The pipeline inventory stood at $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2008 compared to $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2007.
 
Goodwill and Non-amortizable Intangible Assets
 
The Company is currently still in the process of completing its year-end assessment of goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible assets.  Given the uncertainty surrounding the global economy and the volatility of the Company's market capitalization during the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company was required to perform such testing as of December 31, 2008, in addition to the normal test performed as of October 1, 2008.  The Company will have significant impairment charges to record, most likely in the Americas, EMEA and Development Services segments.  Given the complexity of this assessment, the final results are not yet completed, nor can a reasonable estimate be provided at this time.  The Company will complete this assessment and record a charge prior to the filing of its 2008 Form 10-K.  The impairment charge recorded will be non-cash in nature and will not affect liquidity, cash flows from operating activities, or compliance with debt covenants.

(1) One-time charges include amortization expense related to net revenue backlog, incentive fees and customer relationships resulting from acquisitions, merger-related charges, integration costs related to acquisitions, cost containment expenses, loss on trading securities acquired in the Trammell Crow Company acquisition, an adjustment to tax expense as a result of a decline in the value of assets associated with the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan and the write-down of impaired assets.
 
(2) Net debt only includes debt that is recourse to the company.
 
(3) A reconciliation of net income to net income, as adjusted for one-time items, is provided in the exhibits to this release.
 
The Company's management believes that EBITDA is useful in evaluating its operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.  As a result, the Company's management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of various business lines and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring its operating performance under its employee incentive programs.
(4) 
 
However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and when analyzing the Company's operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income determined in accordance with GAAP.  Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.  The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain
other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
 
For a reconciliation of EBITDA with the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
 
(5) Includes impairment of assets of $100.4 million, cost containment of $27.4 million and integration costs related to acquisitions of $16.4 million, the majority of which related to the Trammell Crow Company acquisition.
 
(6) Includes merger-related expenses of $56.9 million, the loss on sale of trading securities acquired in the Trammell Crow Company acquisition of $33.7 million and integration costs related to acquisitions of $45.2 million, the majority of which related to the Trammell Crow Company acquisition.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The following measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC guidelines:
 
Net income, as adjusted for one-time items
(i)
                                    
 
Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted for one-time items
(ii)
                                 
 
EBITDA
(iii)
                              
 
Operating income, as adjusted for one-time items
(iv)
                             
 
The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of current results to prior periods as well as presenting the effects of one-time items in all periods presented.  The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of one-time items that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of its business.
 
Net income, as adjusted for one-time items and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted for one-time items are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):
 
 
                EBITDA for the Company is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):
