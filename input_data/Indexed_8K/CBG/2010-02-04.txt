FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Los Angeles, CA  February 3, 2010  CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today reported fourth-quarter 2009 diluted earnings per share of $0.21 on a U.S. GAAP basis, on revenue of $1.30 billion. The Company reported net income for the quarter of $64.3 million. Excluding selected charges(1), net income(2) for the fourth quarter would have totaled $86.0 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA)(3) for the fourth quarter totaled $167.1 million, which included $31.9 million(4) of selected charges.
 
These results compared with fourth quarter 2008 revenue of $1.28 billion, and a net loss of $1.1 billion, or $4.70 loss per diluted share, on a U.S. GAAP basis (driven by sizeable non-cash goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible asset impairments as well as other real estate investment impairments). Excluding selected charges, fourth-quarter 2008 net income would have totaled $87.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share.  Fourth-quarter 2008 EBITDA of $121.5 million included $101.7 million(5) of selected charges.
 
"Fourth quarter results were by far our best for the year, and we achieved quarterly year-over-year top-line growth for the first time in seven quarters," said Brett White, president and chief executive officer of CB Richard Ellis. "Stronger fourth-quarter performance is consistent with historical seasonal trends, which normally see us generate higher revenue and profits as the year progresses.  At the same time, macro market conditions  which showed anecdotal signs of stabilizing during the third quarter  have further improved, especially in Asia Pacific and parts of Europe, where results were strongest.  In the fourth quarter, all major geographies posted their best quarterly year-over-year revenue comparisons for the year. It is evident that our efforts to streamline our business and eliminate $600 million of operating costs over the past two years have helped us to convert more revenue to the bottom line.
 
"Over the past year, we made tremendous progress in improving our balance sheet and enhancing our financial strength," Mr. White continued. "We negotiated maturity and amortization extensions on nearly $1 billion of bank debt and raised approximately $900 million of new capital, including $300 million of equity in November. These moves 
 
 
coupled with our cost containment initiatives and continued focus on business development and client service  position us to capitalize on market opportunities."
 
During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company saw investment sales activity rebound nicely in Europe and Asia Pacific compared with the year-ago quarter's depressed levels. In the Americas, investment sales revenue grew for the first time in nine quarters, but at a more modest rate than in Europe and Asia Pacific.  Leasing results were also sharply higher in Asia Pacific, as that region leads the global economic recovery.
 
Reflecting the Company's successful revenue diversification efforts, Europe and Asia Pacific also posted solid growth in contractually-based outsourcing businesses, including property and facilities management. While the Americas outsourcing business continues to expand its client base, corporate spending restraint continues to hamper revenue growth.
 
On a global basis, CB Richard Ellis signed long-term outsourcing contracts with seven new clients and renewed or expanded 17 existing contracts during the fourth quarter. For all of 2009, the Company secured 32 new outsourcing contracts and renewed or expanded 56 existing relationships, illustrating the continuing strong momentum for this line of business that was evident in 2008.
 
The U.S. property and facilities management business lines generated approximately $110 million of EBITDA, which comprised 30% of total Company EBITDA in 2009  up from approximately $105 million, which comprised 23% of total company EBITDA in 2008.  This performance underscores the continued resilience of these business lines during a market downturn, and their significant contributions to the overall Company.
 
The Company also continued to seize opportunities resulting from the downturn in the marketplace.  For example, CB Richard Ellis has been appointed receiver for more than 20 million square feet of property in the U.S. and four million square feet in the U.K. The Company's portfolio of distressed assets being marketed for sale in the U.S. grew to more than $5 billion at year-end 2009.
 
In addition, CB Richard Ellis was awarded a $2 billion sale and leaseback portfolio from the State of California in December. This is the largest disposition assignment currently in the marketplace, and an example of a long-term owner looking to monetize asset value.
 
2009 Full Year Results
 
For full year 2009, CB Richard Ellis produced diluted earnings per share of $0.12 on a U.S. GAAP basis, on revenue of $4.17 billion. U.S. GAAP
net income totaled $33.3 million for the year. Excluding selected charges, net income totaled $109.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for 2009. EBITDA for 2009 totaled $372.1 million, which included $81.8 million(
6
) of selected charges.
 
The comparable results for full year 2008 were revenue of $5.13 billion; a U.S. GAAP net loss of $1.0 billion, or $4.81 loss per diluted share (driven by significant non-cash goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible asset impairments as well as other real estate investment impairments); adjusted net income of $208.7 million, or $0.97 per diluted share,
and EBITDA of $457.0 million.  The 2008 EBITDA included $144.2 million(
7
) of selected charges.
 
Balance Sheet Update
 
In November, the Company completed the sale of 28,289,960 shares of its Class A common stock, receiving gross proceeds of approximately $300 million. This capital-raise  coupled with other strategic actions taken during the course of the year  enabled the Company to lower its net debt by approximately $550 million in 2009 to approximately $1.4 billion at year-end. CB Richard Ellis' leverage ratio under its credit agreement declined to 2.23x covenant EBITDA at year-end 2009 versus a maximum allowable ratio of 4.25x.
 
Fourth-Quarter 2009 Segment Results
 
Americas Region
 
Revenue for the Americas region, including the U.S., Canada and Latin America, was $769.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $824.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Operating income for the Americas region was $83.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with a loss of $689.9 million for the same period of 2008.  The operating loss in the prior year was driven by a goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible asset impairment charge of $805.2 million.  EBITDA for this region totaled $103.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $133.8 million in last year's fourth quarter.
 
EMEA Region
 
Revenue for the EMEA region, which mainly consists of operations in Europe, rose 8% to $287.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 from $266.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.  The EMEA region reported operating income of $48.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with an operating loss of $103.4 million for the same period in 2008.  The operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2008 was attributable to a goodwill impairment charge of $138.6 million.  EMEA reported EBITDA of $49.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $39.3 million for last year's fourth quarter.  These improved results reflect better business performance in several countries, particularly the United Kingdom, France, Italy and the Netherlands, and the benefit of cost reductions.
 
Asia Pacific Region
 
In the Asia Pacific region, which includes operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, revenue rose 43% to $177.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 from $123.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Operating income for the Asia Pacific region improved sharply to $23.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, up from $2.1 million for the same period of 2008.  EBITDA also increased significantly to $26.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with $3.7 million for last year's fourth quarter. These improved results reflect better business performance throughout the region, particularly in Australia and China.
 
Global Investment Management Business
 
In the Global Investment Management segment, which includes investment management operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia, revenue was little changed at $38.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $39.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.  The
operating loss for the fourth quarter was $0.7 million compared with an operating loss of $27.8 million for the same period in 2008.  The prior-year fourth quarter was impacted by a goodwill impairment charge of $44.9 million, partially offset by a reversal of carried interest incentive compensation of $25.8 million.  Fourth-quarter 2009 EBITDA totaled negative $2.3 million, compared with negative EBITDA of $10.1 million in the prior year fourth quarter.  EBITDA was impacted by the net non-cash write downs associated with decreases in co-investment asset valuations of $3.6 million and $24.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
 
Assets under management totaled $34.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, consistent with the third quarter of 2009 and down from $38.5 billion at year-end 2008.
 
Development Services
 
In the Development Services segment, which consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the U.S., revenue totaled $24.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $29.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Development Services posted an operating loss of $14.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to a $236.0 million operating loss for the same period in 2008.  The operating loss in the prior-year period was impacted by a goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible asset impairment charge of $170.7 million, which did not recur in the current year.  In addition, the prior-year period included $59.3 million of other real estate investment impairment charges versus $9.2 million in the current year period.
 
Fourth-quarter 2009 EBITDA was negative $9.6 million, compared with negative EBITDA of $45.2 million in the prior year fourth quarter.  The improved EBITDA performance was primarily driven by lower non-cash write-downs of real estate assets in the current year.
 
Development projects in process as of December 31, 2009 totaled $4.7 billion, down 8% from the third quarter of 2009 and 16% from year-end 2008. The inventory of pipeline deals as of December 31, 2009 stood at $0.9 billion, down 64% from year-end 2008.
 
Future Earnings Prospects
 
Over the past two years, CB Richard Ellis has not provided any guidance regarding its short term earnings prospects. However, as the global economy begins to emerge from this unprecedented financial crisis and returns to what appears to be the beginning of a more "normal" operating environment, the Company feels it is appropriate to remind the investment community of its consistent and longstanding view of its operating leverage in a normal environment.  Notwithstanding years with unusual positive or negative influence upon revenues, CB Richard Ellis believes it should be able to deliver annual revenue growth in the 6-8% range, annual EBITDA growth in the 10-14% range and annual EPS growth in the 15-20% range.  While it is still far too early to describe 2010 as a normal operating environment, the Company's initial expectation is that 2010 performance may be within these more typical ranges.

Selected charges include a tax true-up related to the write-off of financing costs incurred in connection with the credit agreement amendment entered into on March 24, 2009, amortization expense related to customer relationships resulting from acquisitions, integration costs related to acquisitions, cost-containment expenses and the write-down of impaired assets.
 
(2) A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. to net income attributable to CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc., as adjusted for selected items, is provided in the section of this release entitled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
 
The Company's management believes that EBITDA is useful in evaluating its operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.  As a result, the Company's management uses EBITDA as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of various business segments and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring its operating performance under its employee incentive programs. Additionally, management believes EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of the Company's results from operations.
(3)
 
However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and when analyzing the Company's operating performance, readers should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income determined in accordance with GAAP.  Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments.  The amounts shown for EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in the Company's debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
 
For a reconciliation of EBITDA to net income (loss) attributable to CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc. to the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
