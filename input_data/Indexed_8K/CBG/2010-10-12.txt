Events of Default
Registration Rights Agreement
The following is a brief description of the material provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement.
Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Issuer agreed to (1) file a registration statement on an appropriate registration form, within 180 days after October 8, 2010, the issue date of the Notes, enabling holders of the Notes to exchange the privately placed Notes for publicly registered Notes with substantially identical terms, (2) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective within 270 days after October 8, 2010, (3) consummate the exchange offer no later than 40 days after the date the registration statement is declared effective and (4) file a shelf registration statement for the resale of the Notes if it cannot effect an exchange offer by the 310th day after October 8, 2010 and in other limited circumstances.
If the Issuer does not comply with its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, the interest rate applicable to the Notes will increase initially by 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period immediately following the failure to comply with its registration obligations, and by an additional 0.25% per annum for each subsequent 90-day period during which the failure to comply continues, up to a maximum additional interest rate of 1.00% per year over the interest rate of 6.625% payable on the Notes.

The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange. The Company may have one or more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent.
Registrar and Paying Agent.

The agreement shall implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the name and address of any such agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such and shall be entitled to appropriate compensation and indemnification therefor pursuant to Section 7.07. The Company or any Wholly Owned Subsidiary incorporated or organized within The United States of America may act as Paying Agent, Registrar, co-registrar or transfer agent.
The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying Agent in connection with the Securities. The Company may change the Registrar and any Paying Agent without prior notice to any Holder.
42
 
Section 2.04.   Prior to each due date of the principal and interest on any Security, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent a sum sufficient to pay such principal and interest when so becoming due. The Company shall require each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Securityholders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities and shall notify the Trustee of any default by the Company in making any such payment. If the Company or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee and to account for any funds disbursed by the Paying Agent. Upon complying with this Section, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for the money delivered to the Trustee.

Securityholder Lists.
Section 2.06.   The Securities shall be issued in registered form and shall be transferable only upon the surrender of a Security for registration of transfer. When a Security is presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register the transfer as requested if the requirements of this Indenture and Section 8-401(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code are met. When Securities are presented to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations, the Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the same requirements are met.
Transfer and Exchange.
Section 2.07.   If a mutilated Security is surrendered to the Registrar or if the Holder of a Security claims that the Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security if the requirements of Section 8-405 of the Uniform Commercial Code are met and the Holder satisfies any other reasonable requirements of the Trustee. Such Holder shall furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of the Company and the Trustee to protect the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar and any co-registrar from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Security is replaced. The Company and the Trustee may charge the Holder for their expenses in replacing a Security.
Replacement Securities.
Every replacement Security is an additional obligation of the Company.
Section 2.08.   Securities outstanding at any time are all Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those

delivered to it for cancellation and those described in this Section as not outstanding. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate of the Company holds the Security.
If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee and the Company receive proof satisfactory to them that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.
If the principal amount of any Security is considered paid under Section 4.01, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases to accrue.
If the Paying Agent segregates and holds in trust, in accordance with this Indenture, on a redemption date or maturity date money sufficient to pay all principal and interest payable on that date with respect to the Securities (or portions thereof) to be redeemed or maturing, as the case may be, then on and after that date such Securities (or portions thereof) cease to be outstanding and interest on them ceases to accrue.
Section 2.09.   Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Securities and deliver them in exchange for temporary Securities. Holders and beneficial holders, as the case may be, of temporary Securities shall be entitled to all of the benefits accorded to Holders, or beneficial holders, respectively, of definitive Securities under this Indenture.

The Company may pay the defaulted interest to the persons who are Securityholders on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix or cause to be fixed any such special record date and payment date to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee and shall promptly send to each Securityholder a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of defaulted interest to be paid.
Defaulted Interest.
Section 2.12.   The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; ,
CUSIP Numbers.
provided
44
 
, that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.
however
Section 2.13.   The Company shall be entitled, subject to its compliance with Section 4.03, to issue Additional Securities under this Indenture which shall have identical terms as the Initial Securities issued on the Issue Date, other than with respect to the date of issuance and issue price. The Initial Securities issued on the Issue Date, any Additional Securities and all Exchange Securities or Private Exchange Securities issued in exchange therefor shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under this Indenture.
Issuance of Additional Securities.
With respect to any Additional Securities, the Company shall set forth in a resolution of the Board of Directors and an Officer's Certificate, a copy of each which shall be delivered to the Trustee, the following information:
(1)  the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Securities to be authenticated and delivered pursuant to this Indenture;
(2)  the issue price, the issue date and the CUSIP number of such Additional Securities; , , that no Additional Securities may be issued at a price that would cause such Additional Securities to have "original issue discount" within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (unless then applicable regulations under the Code would treat the outstanding Securities and the Additional Securities as part of the same issue); and
provided
however
(3)  whether such Additional Securities shall be Transfer Restricted Securities and issued in the form of Initial Securities as set forth in the Appendix to this Indenture or shall be issued in the form of Exchange Securities as set forth in Exhibit A.
Section 3.01.   If the Company elects to redeem Securities pursuant to paragraph 5 of the Securities, it shall notify the Trustee in writing of the redemption date, the principal amount of Securities to be redeemed and the paragraph of the Securities pursuant to which the redemption will occur.
Notices to Trustee.

45
 
Opinion of Counsel from the Company to the effect that such redemption will comply with the conditions herein.
Section 3.02.   If fewer than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by a method that complies with applicable legal and securities exchange requirements, if any, and that the Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem to be fair and appropriate and in accordance with methods generally used at the time of selection by fiduciaries in similar circumstances. The Trustee shall make the selection from outstanding Securities not previously called for redemption. The Trustee may select for redemption portions of the principal of Securities that have minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 thereof. Securities and portions of them the Trustee selects shall be in principal amounts of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 thereof. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for redemption. The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of the Securities or portions of Securities to be redeemed.
Selection of Securities To Be Redeemed.
Section 3.03.   At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a date for redemption of Securities, the Company shall mail a notice of redemption by first-class mail to each Holder to be redeemed at such Holder's registered address or otherwise deliver such notice in accordance with the procedures of the Depository.
Notice of Redemption.
The notice shall identify the Securities to be redeemed (including the CUSIP numbers) and shall state:
(1)  the redemption date;
(2)  the redemption price;
(3)  the name and address of the Paying Agent;
(4)  that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price;

(6)  that, unless the Company defaults in making such redemption payment, interest on Securities (or portion thereof) called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date;
(7)  the paragraph of the Securities pursuant to which the Securities called for redemption are being redeemed; and
46
 
(8)  that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Securities.
At the Company's written request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Company's name and at the Company's expense. In such event, the Company shall provide the Trustee with the information required by this Section.
Section 3.04.   Once notice of redemption is sent, Securities called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption date and at the redemption price stated in the notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the completion thereof, and any such redemption or notice, may, at the Company's discretion, be subject to the completion of the related Equity Offering. The notice, if sent in a manner herein provided, shall be conclusively presumed to have been given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. Failure to give notice or any defect in the notice to any Holder shall not affect the validity of the notice to any other Holder. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent, such Securities shall be paid at the redemption price stated in the notice, plus accrued interest to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the related interest payment date).
Effect of Notice of Redemption.
Section 3.05.   Prior to the redemption date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent (or, if the Company or a Subsidiary is the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on all Securities to be redeemed on that date other than Securities or portions of Securities called for redemption which have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation. The Paying Agent shall promptly return to the Company any money deposited with the Paying Agent by the Company in excess of the amounts necessary to pay the redemption price of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all Securities to be redeemed.
Deposit of Redemption Price.
If the Company complies with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, on and after the redemption date, interest shall cease to accrue on the Securities or the portions of the Securities called for redemption. If a Security is redeemed on or after a record date but on or prior to the related interest payment date, then any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Security was registered at the close of business on such record date. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender for redemption because of the failure of the Company to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the redemption date until such principal is paid, and to the extent lawful on any interest accrued to the redemption date not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Security.
Section 3.06.   Upon surrender of a Security that is redeemed in part, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate for

obtained at the time in an arm's-length transaction with a Person who was not an Affiliate.

Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a "Notice of Default."
The Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice in the form of an Officer's Certificate of any Event of Default under clause (7) or (11) and any event which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would become an Event of Default under clause (4), (5), (6) or (10), its status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

In the event of any Event of Default specified under clause (7), such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of Securities) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose, (a) Holders have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (b) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.
Section 6.02.   If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(8) or (9) with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on all the Securities to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(8) or (9) with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, the principal of and interest on all the Securities shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Securityholders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities by written notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of acceleration. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.
Acceleration.
Section 6.03.   If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this Indenture.
Other Remedies.
The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.
Section 6.04.   The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities by written notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default and its consequences except (i) a Default in the payment of the principal of or interest on a Security, (ii) a Default arising from the failure to redeem or purchase any Security when required pursuant to this Indenture or (iii) a Default in respect of a provision that under Section 9.02 cannot be amended or waived without the consent of each Securityholder affected. When a Default is waived, it is deemed cured, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any consequent right.
Waiver of Past Defaults.

Section 6.05.   The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or, subject to Section 7.01, that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Securityholders or would involve the Trustee in personal liability; , , that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. Prior to taking any action hereunder, the Trustee shall receive indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to Securityholders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided for in Section 7.07.
If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee or the Holders of 10% in principal amount of the Securities may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

the name of the successor to the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.
Section 7.10.   The Trustee shall at all times satisfy the requirements of TIA  310(a). The Trustee (or, in the case of a subsidiary of a bank holding company, its corporate parent) shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition. The Trustee shall comply with TIA  310(b); , , that there shall be excluded from the operation of TIA  310(b)(1) any indenture or indentures under which other securities or certificates of interest or participation in other securities of the Company are outstanding if the requirements for such exclusion set forth in TIA  310(b)(1) are met.

The Trustee shall acknowledge satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture on demand of the Company accompanied by an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel and at the cost and expense of the Company.
Discharge of Liability on Securities; Defeasance.
(b)  Subject to Sections 8.01(c) and 8.02, the Company at any time may terminate (1) all its and each Guarantor's obligations under the Securities, the Guaranties and this Indenture ("legal defeasance option") or (2) its obligations under Sections 4.02, 4.03, 4.04, 4.05, 4.06, 4.07, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12 and 4.13 and the operation of Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(5), 6.01(7), 6.01(8), 6.01(9) and 6.01(10) (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(8) and (9), with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries), the limitations contained in Section 5.01(a)(3) and the Guarantors' Obligations under the Guaranties and this Indenture ("covenant defeasance option"). The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option.
79
 
If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment of the Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in Sections 6.01(4), 6.01(5), 6.01(7), 6.01(8), 6.01(9) and 6.01(10) (but, in the case of Sections 6.01(8) and (9), with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries) or because of the failure of the Company to comply with Section 5.01(a)(3). If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each Guarantor, if any, shall be released from all its obligations with respect to its Guaranty.
Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Indenture and upon request of the Company, the Trustee shall acknowledge in writing the discharge of those obligations that the Company terminates.
(c)  Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) of this Section 8.01, the Company's obligations in Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 7.07 and 7.08 and in this Article 8 shall survive until the Securities have been paid in full. Thereafter, the Company's obligations in Sections 7.07, 8.04 and 8.05 shall survive.
Section 8.02.   The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option only if:
Conditions to Defeasance.

(2)  the Company delivers to the Trustee a certificate from a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants expressing their opinion that the payments of principal and interest when due and without reinvestment on the deposited U.S. Government Obligations plus any deposited money without investment will provide cash at such times and in such amounts as will be sufficient to pay principal and interest when due on all the Securities to maturity or redemption, as the case may be;
(3)  123 days pass after the deposit is made and during the 123-day period no Default specified in Sections 6.01(8) or (9) with respect to the Company occurs which is continuing at the end of the period;
(4)  the deposit does not constitute a default under any other agreement binding on the Company;

80
 
(6)  in the case of the legal defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (B) since the date of this Indenture there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Securityholders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not occurred;
(7)  in the case of the covenant defeasance option, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Securityholders will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred; and
(8)  the Company delivers to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent to the defeasance and discharge of the Securities as contemplated by this Article 8 have been complied with.
Before or after a deposit, the Company may make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the redemption of Securities at a future date in accordance with Article 3.
Section 8.03.   The Trustee shall hold in trust money or U.S. Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to this Article 8.

Section 8.05.   The Company shall pay and shall indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on
Indemnity for Government Obligations.
81
 
or assessed against deposited U.S. Government Obligations or the principal and interest received on such U.S. Government Obligations.
Section 8.06.   If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article 8 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities and the Guarantors' obligations under their respective Guaranties shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article 8 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with this Article 8; , , that, if the Company has made any payment of interest on or principal of any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

After an amendment under this Section 9.01 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to Securityholders a notice briefly describing such amendment.

The failure to give such notice to all Securityholders, or any defect therein, shall not impair or affect the validity of an amendment under this Section 9.02.

However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent or waiver as to such Holder's Security or portion of the Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date the amendment or waiver becomes effective. After an amendment or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Securityholder. An amendment or waiver becomes effective upon the execution of such amendment or waiver by the Trustee.
Revocation and Effect of Consents and Waivers.
The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Securityholders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture.

No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 120 days after such record date.

Section 9.05.   If an amendment changes the terms of a Security, the Trustee may require the Holder of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the Security regarding the changed terms and return it to the Holder.

Failure to make the appropriate notation or to issue a new Security shall not affect the validity of such amendment.

Payment for Consent.
Section 10.01.   Each Guarantor required to execute and deliver a Guaranty Agreement pursuant to Section 4.13 shall, upon execution and delivery of its Guaranty Agreement, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee, jointly and severally, to each Holder and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns (a) the full and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the Securities when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, and all other monetary obligations of the Company under this Indenture and the Securities and (b) the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations of the Company under this Indenture and the Securities (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the "Guaranteed Obligations"). Each Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or further assent from such Guarantor and that such Guarantor will remain bound under this Article 10 notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guaranteed Obligation.
Guaranties.
85
 
Each Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of, payment from and protest to the Company of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and also waives notice of protest for nonpayment. Each Guarantor waives notice of any default under the Securities or the Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against the Company or any other Person under this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any thereof; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement; (d) the release of any security held by any Holder or the Trustee for the Guaranteed Obligations or any of them; (e) the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to exercise any right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Obligations; or (f) except as set forth in Section 10.06, any change in the ownership of such Guarantor.
Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guaranty herein constitutes a guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Holder or the Trustee to any security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.
Except as expressly set forth in Sections 8.01(b), 10.02 and 10.06, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure of any Holder or the Trustee to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under this Indenture, the Securities or any other agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Guarantor or would otherwise operate as a discharge of such Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
Each Guarantor further agrees that its Guarantee herein shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Holder or the Trustee upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right which any Holder or the Trustee has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay the principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to perform or comply with any other Guaranteed Obligation, each Guarantor hereby promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Trustee, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Holders
86
 
or the Trustee an amount equal to the sum of (1) the unpaid amount of such Guaranteed Obligations, (2) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed Obligations (but only to the extent not prohibited by law) and (3) all other monetary Guaranteed Obligations of the Company to the Holders and the Trustee.
Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (x) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations may be accelerated as provided in Article 6 for the purposes of such Guarantor's Guaranty herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, and (y) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations as provided in Article 6, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable by such Guarantor for the purposes of this Section 10.01.
Each Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section 10.01.
Section 10.02.   Any term or provision of this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Obligations guaranteed hereunder by any Subsidiary Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering this Indenture, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
Limitation on Liability.
Section 10.03.   This Article 10 shall be binding upon each Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall enure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Trustee and the Holders and, in the event of any transfer or assignment of rights by any Holder or the Trustee, the rights and privileges conferred upon that party in this Indenture and in the Securities shall automatically extend to and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and conditions of this Indenture.
Successors and Assigns.
Section 10.04.   Neither a failure nor a delay on the part of either the Trustee or the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article 10 shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege. The rights, remedies and benefits of the Trustee and the Holders herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights, remedies or benefits which either may have under this Article 10 at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
No Waiver.
Section 10.05.   No modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Article 10, nor the consent to any departure by any Guarantor therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Trustee, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on any Guarantor
Modification.
87
 
in any case shall entitle such Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
Section 10.06.   The Subsidiary Guarantors shall be deemed released from all obligations under this Article 10 without any further action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder: (1) upon the sale (including any sale pursuant to any exercise of remedies by a holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Company or of such Subsidiary Guarantor) or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a Subsidiary Guarantor, (2) upon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor (in each case other than a sale or disposition to the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company), (3) at such time a Subsidiary Guarantor no longer Guarantees any other Indebtedness of the Company, (4) upon the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, (5) upon the defeasance of the Securities, as provided under Article 8 or (6) pursuant to Article 9, in the case of clause (1) or (2), other than to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company and as permitted by this Indenture. At the written request of the Company, the Trustee shall execute and deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing such release.
Release of Subsidiary Guarantor.
Section 10.07.   Each Subsidiary Guarantor that makes a payment under its Subsidiary Guaranty will be entitled upon payment in full of all Guaranteed Obligations to a contribution from each other Subsidiary Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Subsidiary Guarantor's pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Subsidiary Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

Banc of America Securities LLC
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
    As Representatives of the Initial Purchasers
c/o Banc of America Securities LLC
One Bryant Park
New York, New York 10036
Dear Sirs:
CB Richard Ellis Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer"), proposes to issue and sell to Banc of America Securities LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and certain other initial purchasers (collectively, the "Initial Purchasers"), upon the terms set forth in a purchase agreement of even date herewith (the "Purchase Agreement"), $350,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.625% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "Initial Securities") to be unconditionally guaranteed (the "Guaranties") by CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Parent"), and certain subsidiaries of the Issuer, as set forth in the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the "Guarantors" and together with the Issuer, the "Company"). The Initial Securities will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of October 8, 2010, (the "Indenture") among the Issuer, the Guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). As an inducement to the Initial Purchasers to enter into the Purchase Agreement, the Company agrees with the Initial Purchasers, for the benefit of the holders of the Initial Securities (including, without limitation, the Initial Purchasers), the Exchange Securities (as defined below) and the Private Exchange Securities (as defined below) (collectively, the "Holders"), as follows:
1. .    Unless not permitted by applicable law (after the Company has complied with the last paragraph of this Section 1), the Company shall prepare and, not later than 180 days after the date of original issue of the Initial Securities (the "Issue Date"), file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement (the "Exchange Offer Registration Statement") on an appropriate form under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to a proposed offer (the "Registered Exchange Offer") to the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities (as defined in Section 6 hereof), who are not prohibited by any law or policy of the Commission from participating in the Registered Exchange Offer, to issue and deliver to such Holders, in exchange for the Initial Securities, a like aggregate principal amount of debt securities of the Company issued under the Indenture, identical in all material respects to the Initial Securities and registered under the
Registered Exchange Offer
Securities Act (the "Exchange Securities"). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause such Exchange Offer Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act within 270 days after the Issue Date of the Initial Securities and (ii) keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective for not less than 30 business days (or longer, if required by applicable law) after the date notice of the Registered Exchange Offer is mailed to the Holders (such period being called the "Exchange Offer Registration Period").
If the Company commences the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company (i) will be entitled to consummate the Registered Exchange Offer 20 business days after such commencement ( that the Company has accepted all the Initial Securities theretofore validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Registered Exchange Offer) and (ii) will be required to consummate the Registered Exchange Offer no later than 40 days after the date on which the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is declared effective (such 40th day being the "Consummation Deadline").
provided
Following the declaration of the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, the Company shall promptly commence the Registered Exchange Offer, it being the objective of such Registered Exchange Offer to enable each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities electing to exchange the Initial Securities for Exchange Securities (assuming that such Holder is not an affiliate of the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, acquires the Exchange Securities in the ordinary course of such Holder's business and has no arrangements with any person to participate in the distribution of the Exchange Securities and is not prohibited by any law or policy of the Commission from participating in the Registered Exchange Offer) to trade such Exchange Securities from and after their receipt without any limitations or restrictions under the Securities Act and without material restrictions under the securities laws of the several states of the United States.
The Company acknowledges that, pursuant to current interpretations by the Commission's staff of Section 5 of the Securities Act, in the absence of an applicable exemption therefrom, (i) each Holder which is a broker-dealer electing to exchange Initial Securities, acquired for its own account as a result of market making activities or other trading activities, for Exchange Securities (an "Exchanging Dealer"), is required to deliver a prospectus containing the information set forth in (a) Annex A hereto on the cover, (b) Annex B hereto in the "Exchange Offer Procedures" section and the "Purpose of the Exchange Offer" section and (c) Annex C hereto in the "Plan of Distribution" section of such prospectus in connection with a sale of any such Exchange Securities received by such Exchanging Dealer pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer and (ii) an Initial Purchaser that elects to sell Exchange Securities acquired in exchange for Initial Securities constituting any portion of an unsold allotment is required to deliver a prospectus containing the information required by Items 507 or 508 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, as applicable, in connection with such sale.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective and to amend and supplement the prospectus contained therein, in order to permit such prospectus to be lawfully delivered by all persons subject
 
to the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act for such period of time as such persons must comply with such requirements in order to resell the Exchange Securities; , , that (i) in the case where such prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto must be delivered by an Exchanging Dealer or an Initial Purchaser, such period shall be the lesser of 180 days and the date on which all Exchanging Dealers and the Initial Purchasers have sold all Exchange Securities held by them (unless such period is extended pursuant to Section 3(j) below) and (ii) the Company shall make such prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any resale of any Exchange Securities for a period of not less than 180 days after the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement continuously effective to the extent set forth above if the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, upon advice of counsel, that the continued effectiveness and usability of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement would (i) require the disclosure of material information, which the Company or any of its subsidiaries has a bona fide business reason for preserving as confidential or (ii) interfere with any existing or prospective financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or other material business situation, transaction or negotiation involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries; , , that the failure to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective and usable for such reason shall last no longer than 30 days (whereafter Additional Interest (as defined in Section 6(a)) shall accrue and be payable until the Exchange Offer Registration Statement becomes effective and usable) and shall in no event occur during the first 30 days after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement becomes effective. In the event that the Company does not keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement continuously effective as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, the number of days during which the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not continuously effective, which shall include the date the Company gives notice that the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is no longer effective, shall be added on to, and therefore extend, the period during which the Company is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement effective and to amend and supplement the prospectus contained therein.

If, upon consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer, any Initial Purchaser holds Initial Securities acquired by it as part of its initial distribution, the Company, simultaneously with the delivery of the Exchange Securities pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer, shall issue and deliver to such Initial Purchaser upon the written request of such Initial Purchaser, in exchange (the "Private Exchange") for the Initial Securities held by such Initial Purchaser, a like principal amount of debt securities of the Company issued under the Indenture and identical in all material respects to the Initial Securities (the "Private Exchange Securities"). The Initial Securities, the Exchange Securities and the Private Exchange Securities are herein collectively called the "Securities".
In connection with the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company shall:
 
(a)  mail to each Holder a copy of the prospectus forming part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, together with an appropriate letter of transmittal and related documents;
(b)  keep the Registered Exchange Offer open for not less than 20 business days (or longer, if required by applicable law) after the date notice thereof is mailed to the Holders;
(c)  utilize the services of a depositary for the Registered Exchange Offer, which may be the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee;
(d)  permit Holders to withdraw tendered Securities at any time prior to the close of business, New York time, on the last business day on which the Registered Exchange Offer shall remain open; and
(e)  otherwise comply with all applicable laws.
As soon as practicable after the close of the Registered Exchange Offer or the Private Exchange, as the case may be, the Company shall:
(x) accept for exchange all the Securities validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer and the Private Exchange;
(y) deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all the Initial Securities so accepted for exchange; and
(z) cause the Trustee to authenticate and deliver promptly to each Holder of the Initial Securities, Exchange Securities or Private Exchange Securities, as the case may be, equal in principal amount to the Initial Securities of such Holder so accepted for exchange.
The Indenture will provide that the Exchange Securities will not be subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the Indenture and that all the Securities will vote and consent together on all matters as one class and that none of the Securities will have the right to vote or consent as a class separate from one another on any matter.
Interest on each Exchange Security and Private Exchange Security issued pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer and in the Private Exchange will accrue from the last interest payment date on which interest was paid on the Initial Securities surrendered in exchange therefor or, if no interest has been paid on the Initial Securities, from the date of original issue of the Initial Securities.
Each Holder participating in the Registered Exchange Offer shall be required to represent to the Company that at the time of the consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer (i) any Exchange Securities received by such Holder will be acquired in the ordinary course of business, (ii) such Holder will have no arrangements or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the Securities or the
 
Exchange Securities within the meaning of the Securities Act, (iii) such Holder is not an "affiliate," as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act, of the Company or if it is an affiliate, such Holder will comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act to the extent applicable, (iv) if such Holder is not a broker-dealer, that it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, the distribution of the Exchange Securities and (v) if such Holder is a broker-dealer, that it will receive Exchange Securities for its own account in exchange for Initial Securities that were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities and that it will be required to acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange Securities.
Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the Company will ensure that (i) any Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and any prospectus forming part thereof and any supplement thereto complies in all material respects with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, (ii) any Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (iii) any prospectus forming part of any Exchange Offer Registration Statement, and any supplement to such prospectus, does not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
2.     If, (i) applicable interpretations of the staff of the Commission do not permit the Company to effect a Registered Exchange Offer, as contemplated by Section 1 hereof, (ii) the Registered Exchange Offer is not consummated by the 310th day after the Issue Date, (iii) any Initial Purchaser so requests with respect to the Initial Securities (or the Private Exchange Securities) not eligible to be exchanged for Exchange Securities in the Registered Exchange Offer and held by it following consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer or (iv) any Holder (other than an Exchanging Dealer) is prohibited by law or Commission policy from participating in the Registered Exchange Offer or, in the case of any Holder (other than an Exchanging Dealer) that participates in the Registered Exchange Offer, such Holder does not receive freely tradeable Exchange Securities on the date of the exchange and any such Holder so requests, the Company shall take the following actions (the date on which any of the conditions described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) occur, including in the case of clauses (iii) or (iv) the receipt of the required notice, being a "Trigger Date"):
Shelf Registration.
(a) The Company shall as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 90 days after the Trigger Date (such 90th day being a "Filing Deadline")) file with the Commission and thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be declared effective: in the case of clause (i), no later than 270 days after the Issue Date and, in the case of clauses (ii) through (iv), no later than 90th date after the Trigger Date (such 270th day after the Issue Date in the case of clause (i), or such 90th day after the Trigger Date in the case of clauses (ii) through (iv) being an "Effectiveness Deadline") a registration statement (the "Shelf Registration
 
Statement" and, together with the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, a "Registration Statement") on an appropriate form under the Securities Act relating to the offer and sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities by the Holders thereof from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution set forth in the Shelf Registration Statement and Rule 415 under the Securities Act (hereinafter, the "Shelf Registration"); , , that no Holder (other than the Initial Purchasers) shall be entitled to have the Securities held by it covered by such Shelf Registration Statement unless such Holder agrees in writing to be bound by all the provisions of this Agreement applicable to such Holder.
provided

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective in order to permit the prospectus included therein to be lawfully delivered by the Holders of the relevant Securities, for a period of two years (or for such longer period if extended pursuant to Section 3(j) below) from the date of its effectiveness or such shorter period that will terminate when all the Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement (i) have been sold pursuant thereto or (ii) are no longer restricted securities (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or any successor rule thereof), , , the Company shall not be obligated to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective to the extent set forth below if (i) the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, upon advice of counsel, that the continued effectiveness and usability of the Shelf Registration statement would (x) require the disclosure of material information which the Company or any of its subsidiaries has a bona fide business reason for preserving as confidential or (y) interfere with any financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or other material transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, that the failure to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective and usable for offers and sales of Securities for the reasons set forth in clauses (x) and (y) above shall last no longer than 60 days in any 12-month period (whereafter Additional Interest shall accrue and be payable until the Shelf Registration Statement becomes effective and usable) and (ii) the Company promptly thereafter complies with the requirements of Section 3(j) hereof, if applicable; , , that the number of days of any actual Suspension Period (as hereinafter defined) shall be added on to, and therefore extend, the two-year period specified above. Any such period during which the Company is excused from keeping the Shelf Registration Statement effective and usable for offers and sales of securities is referred to herein as a "Suspension Period." A Suspension Period shall commence on and include the date that the Company gives notice that the Shelf Registration Statement is no longer effective or the prospectus included therein is no longer usable for offers and sales of Securities and shall end on the earlier to occur of (1) the date on which each seller of Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement either receives the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 3(j) hereof or is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the prospectus may be resumed and (2) the expiration of 60 days in any 12-month period during which one or more Suspension Periods has been in effect.

(c)  The Company shall make every reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal at the earliest possible time, of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.
(d)  The Company shall furnish to each Holder of Securities included within the coverage of the Shelf Registration, without charge, at least one copy of the Shelf Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment or supplement thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and, if the Holder so

(e)  The Company shall deliver to each Exchanging Dealer and each Initial Purchaser, and to any other Holder who so requests, without charge, at least one copy of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and, if any Initial Purchaser or any such Holder requests, all exhibits thereto (including those incorporated by reference).

If the Company notifies the Initial Purchasers, the Holders of the Securities and any known Participating Broker-Dealer in accordance with paragraphs (ii) through (v) of Section 3(b) above to suspend the use of the prospectus until the requisite changes to the prospectus have been made, then the Initial Purchasers, the Holders of the Securities and any such Participating Broker-Dealers shall suspend use of such prospectus, and the period of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement provided for in Section 2(b) above and the Exchange Offer Registration Statement provided for in Section 1 above shall each be extended by the number of days from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when the Initial Purchasers, the Holders of the Securities and any known Participating Broker-Dealer shall have received such amended or supplemented prospectus pursuant to this Section 3(j).

(n)  The Company may require each Holder of Securities to be sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement to furnish to the Company such information regarding the Holder and the distribution of the Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably require for inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement, and the Company may exclude from such registration the Securities of any Holder that unreasonably fails to furnish such information within a reasonable time after receiving such request.
(o)  The Company shall enter into such customary agreements (including, if requested by the Holders of at least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities covered thereby, an underwriting agreement in customary form) and take all such other customary action, if any, as the Holders of at least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Securities shall reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Securities pursuant to any Shelf Registration.
(p)  In the case of any Shelf Registration, the Company shall (i) make reasonably available for inspection by the Holders of the Securities, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the Holders of the Securities or any such underwriter all relevant financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company and (ii) cause the Company's officers, directors, employees, accountants and auditors to supply all relevant information reasonably requested by the Holders of the Securities or any such underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with the Shelf Registration Statement (the information supplied pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) being the "Records"), in each case, as shall be reasonably necessary to enable such persons, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act; , , that any such person shall first agree in writing with the Company that any information that is reasonably

(t)  If the Initial Securities have been rated prior to the initial sale of such Initial Securities, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to confirm such ratings will apply to the Securities covered by a Registration Statement.

5.     (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of the Securities, any Participating Broker-Dealer and each person, if any, who controls such Holder or such Participating Broker-Dealer within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each Holder, any Participating Broker-Dealer and such controlling persons are referred to collectively as the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, or any actions in respect thereof (including, but not limited to, any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions relating to purchases and sales of the Securities) to which each Indemnified Party may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus or "issuer free writing prospectus," as defined in Commission Rule 433 ("Issuer FWP"), relating to a Shelf Registration, or arise out of, or are based upon, the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and shall reimburse, as incurred, the Indemnified Parties for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission (A) made in a Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus or Issuer FWP relating to a Shelf Registration in reliance upon and in conformity with written information pertaining to such Holder and furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion therein or (B) resulting from the use of the prospectus during the period when the use of the prospectus was suspended or otherwise unavailable for sales thereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; , , that Holders received at least 5 days' prior written notice of such suspension or other unavailability.

(b)  Each Holder of the Securities, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities or any actions in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in a Registration Statement or prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus or Issuer FWP relating to a Shelf Registration, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in
 
each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information pertaining to such Holder and furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder specifically for inclusion therein; and, subject to the limitation set forth immediately preceding this clause, shall reimburse, as incurred, the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such controlling person in connection with investigating or defending any loss, claim, damage, liability or action in respect thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which such Holder may otherwise have to the Company or any of its controlling persons.
(c)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 5 of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding (including a governmental investigation), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 5, notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may have under subsection (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) as a proximate result of such failure. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party); , , if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that actual conflicts of interest exist between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in conducting the defense of any such action or that there are legal defenses relating to a material aspect of such action available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 5 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (together with local counsel), approved by the indemnifying party, representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.

No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action, and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding without its prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated above, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement, unless such indemnifying party has (a) paid all undisputed amounts and only failed to pay amounts disputed in good faith and (b) provided detail regarding the reasons for the failure to pay amounts requested by the indemnified party.
(d)  If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsections (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other from the exchange of the Securities, pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer, or (ii) if the allocation provided by the foregoing clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Holder or such other indemnified party, as the case may be, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this subsection (d). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5(d), the Holders of the Securities shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such Holders from the sale of the Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds the amount of damages which
 
such Holders have otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this paragraph (d), each person, if any, who controls such indemnified party within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such indemnified party and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
(e)  The agreements contained in this Section 5 shall survive the sale of the Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
6.    (a) Additional interest (the "Additional Interest") with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities shall be assessed as follows if any of the following events occur (each such event in clauses (i) through (iv) below being herein called a "Registration Default"):
Additional Interest Under Certain Circumstances.
(i)  any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not filed with the Commission on or prior to the applicable Filing Deadline (but a Registration Default that occurs because of a failure to file such Registration Statement shall cease to exist upon such Registration Statement being so filed);
(ii)  any Registration Statement required by this Agreement is not declared effective by the Commission on or prior to the applicable Effectiveness Deadline (but a Registration Default that occurs because of a failure of such Registration Statement being declared effective shall cease to exist upon such Registration Statement being so declared effective);
(iii)  the Registered Exchange Offer has not been consummated on or prior to the Consummation Deadline (but a Registration Default that occurs because of a failure to consummate the Registered Exchange Offer shall cease to exist upon such consummation of such Registered Exchange Offer); or
(iv)  any Registration Statement required by this Agreement has been declared effective by the Commission but (A) such Registration Statement thereafter ceases to be effective or (B) such Registration Statement or the related prospectus ceases to be usable in connection with resales of Transfer Restricted Securities during the periods specified herein because either (1) any event occurs as a result of which the related prospectus forming part of such Registration Statement would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances
 
under which they were made not misleading, or (2) it shall be necessary to amend such Registration Statement or supplement the related prospectus, to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder; that a Registration Default under this Section 6(a)(iv) shall cease to exist upon such Registration Statement again being effective and such Registration Statement and the related prospectus again being usable.
provided
Each of the foregoing will constitute a Registration Default whatever the reason for any such event and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is beyond the control of the Company or pursuant to operation of law or as a result of any action or inaction by the Commission.
Additional Interest shall accrue on the Transfer Restricted Securities over and above the interest set forth in the title of the Transfer Restricted Securities from and including the date on which any such Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all such Registration Defaults have been cured, at a rate of 0.25% per annum (the "Additional Interest Rate") for the first 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of such Registration Default. The Additional Interest Rate shall increase by an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day period until all Registration Defaults have been cured, up to a maximum Additional Interest Rate of 1.0% per annum.
(b)  A Registration Default referred to in Section 6(a)(iv) hereof shall be deemed not to have occurred and be continuing in relation to a Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus if (i) such Registration Default has occurred solely as a result of (x) the filing of a post-effective amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement to incorporate annual audited financial information with respect to the Company where such post-effective amendment is not yet effective and needs to be declared effective to permit Holders to use the related prospectus or (y) other material events, with respect to the Company that would need to be described in such Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus and (ii) in the case of clause (y), the Company is proceeding promptly and in good faith to amend or supplement such Shelf Registration Statement and related prospectus to describe such events; , , that in any case if such Registration Default occurs for a continuous period in excess of 30 days, Additional Interest shall be payable in accordance with the above paragraph from the day such Registration Default occurs until such Registration Default is cured.
provided
however
(c)  Any amounts of Additional Interest due pursuant to Section 6(a) will be payable in cash on the regular interest payment dates with respect to the Transfer Restricted Securities. The amount of Additional Interest will be determined by multiplying the applicable Additional Interest Rate by the principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities, and further multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days such Additional Interest Rate was applicable during such period (determined on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months), and the denominator of which is 360.
 
(d) "Transfer Restricted Securities" means each Security until (i) the date on which such Security has been exchanged by a person other than a broker-dealer for a freely transferable Exchange Security in the Registered Exchange Offer, (ii) following the exchange by a broker-dealer in the Registered Exchange Offer of an Initial Security for an Exchange Note, the date on which such Exchange Note is sold to a purchaser who receives from such broker-dealer on or prior to the date of such sale a copy of the prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, (iii) the date on which such Security has been effectively registered under the Securities Act and disposed of in accordance with the Shelf Registration Statement, (iv) the date on which such Security is sold pursuant to Rule 144 (or any similar provision then in effect, but not Rule 144A) under the Securities Act or (v) the date of the second anniversary of this Agreement.
7. .    The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in a timely manner and, if at any time the Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder of Securities, make publicly available other information so long as necessary to permit sales of their Securities pursuant to Rules 144 and 144A. The Company covenants that it will take such further action as any Holder of Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rules 144 and 144A (including the requirements of Rule 144A(d)(4)). The Company will provide a copy of this Agreement to prospective purchasers of Initial Securities identified to the Company by the Initial Purchasers upon request. Upon the request of any Holder of Initial Securities, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed to require the Company to register any of its Securities pursuant to the Exchange Act.
Rules 144 and 144A
8.     If any of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by any Shelf Registration are to be sold in an underwritten offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers that will administer the offering will be selected by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such Transfer Restricted Securities to be included in such offering and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company.
Underwritten Registrations.
No person may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's Transfer Restricted Securities on the basis reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

The Letter of Transmittal states that by so acknowledging and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act. This Prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of Exchange Securities received in exchange for Initial Securities where such Initial Securities were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. The Company has agreed that, for a period of 180 days after the Expiration Date (as defined herein), it will make this Prospectus available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale.

Any such resale may be made directly to purchasers or to or through brokers or dealers who may receive compensation in the form of commissions or concessions from any such broker-dealer or the purchasers of any such Exchange Securities.
