This Current Report on Form 8-K is filed by CB Richard Ellis Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the matters described herein.
 
Share Purchase Agreement (CRES)
On February 15, 2011, CB Richard Ellis, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CBRE Inc.") and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and other affiliates of the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the "CRES Share Purchase Agreement") with ING Real Estate Investment Management Holding B.V., a private limited liability company established under the laws of the Netherlands ("ING REIM"), and others. Under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the CRES Share Purchase Agreement, CBRE Inc. would acquire ING REI Clarion Holding, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of ING REIM ("CRES"). Prior to the closing of the acquisition of CRES, ING REIM will sell the Clarion Partners business unit of ING REIM to a third-party or transfer it to an affiliate of ING REIM, as a result of which the acquisition of CRES will exclude the Clarion Partners business unit. In addition, a subsidiary of the Company would acquire certain assets held by Nationale-Nederlanden Intervest II, B.V., a private limited liability company established under the laws of the Netherlands ("NNI"), in three ING REIM managed funds (the "CRES Co-investment Assets," and the purchase of CRES, together with the purchase of the CRES Co-Investment Assets, the "CRES Transaction"). At the closing of the CRES Transaction, the Company will purchase CRES for $330 million and the CRES Co-investment Assets at their market value (currently estimated to be $55 million) at the time of closing of the CRES Transaction, subject to adjustments (including adjustments based on the level of annualized fee revenue of the business at closing) as provided in the CRES Share Purchase Agreement.
The consummation of the CRES Transaction is conditioned upon the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as well as additional approvals from foreign regulators in Germany and The Netherlands, among others. The consummation of the CRES Transaction is also conditioned upon, among other things, ING REIM's compliance with the material terms of the CRES Share Purchase Agreement relating to the operation and management of CRES prior to the closing of the CRES Transaction, as well as the receipt of requisite consents of investors and other parties necessary to transfer minimum levels of annualized revenue for the accounts managed by CRES. In addition, the purchase price for CRES will be adjusted based on the amount of such annualized revenue that is delivered at closing (subject to additional adjustments after closing) as set forth in more detail in the purchase price adjustment mechanic in the CRES Share Purchase Agreement.
The CRES Share Purchase Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the consummation of the CRES Transaction by the written agreement of CBRE Inc. and ING REIM, or by written notice given by either CBRE Inc. or ING REIM to the counterparty in the event that the CRES Transaction has not been effectuated by November 15, 2011, or a later date as agreed upon by both parties.
Share Purchase Agreement (PERE)
On February 15, 2011, CBRE Inc. and other affiliates of the Company also entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the "PERE Share Purchase Agreement," and together with the CRES Share Purchase Agreement, the "Share Purchase Agreements") with ING REIM and others. Under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the PERE Share Purchase Agreement, an affiliate of the Company would indirectly acquire certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of ING REIM in Asia and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of ING REIM in Europe (together, "PERE"). In addition, a subsidiary of the Company may acquire interests in other funds managed by ING REIM in Europe and Asia (the "PERE Co-Investment Assets," and the purchase of PERE together with the purchase of the PERE Co-Investment Assets, the "PERE Transaction"). At the closing of the PERE Transaction, the Company will purchase PERE for $610 million and the PERE Co-Investment Assets in an amount to be determined, subject to adjustments (including adjustments based on the level of annualized fee revenue of the business at closing) as provided in the PERE Share Purchase Agreement (the PERE Transaction together with the CRES Transaction, the "Transactions").
The consummation of the PERE Transaction is conditioned upon approvals and grants of licenses from foreign regulators and agencies in Germany, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, among others. The consummation of the PERE Transaction is also conditioned upon, among other things, ING REIM's compliance
with the material terms of the PERE Share Purchase Agreement relating to the operation and management of PERE prior to the closing of the PERE Transaction, as well as the receipt of requisite consents of investors and other parties necessary to transfer minimum levels of annualized revenue for the accounts managed by PERE. In addition, the purchase price for PERE will be adjusted based on the amount of such annualized revenue delivered at closing (subject to certain adjustments after closing) as set forth in more detail in the purchase price adjustment mechanic in the PERE Share Purchase Agreement.
The PERE Share Purchase Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the consummation of the PERE Transaction by the written agreement of CBRE Inc. and ING REIM, or by written notice given by either CBRE Inc. or ING REIM to the counterparty in the event the PERE Transaction has not been effectuated by December 1, 2011, or a later date as agreed upon by both parties.
