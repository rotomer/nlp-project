FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Revenue for the quarter totaled $1.8 billion, an increase of 7% from $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
                 
Excluding selected charges, net income totaled $149.3 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, for the current-year quarter, up 29% and 28%, respectively, from $115.4 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2010. Fourth-quarter 2011 results were lowered by selected charges of $69.5 million, net of income taxes, which primarily related to the acquisition of the ING REIM businesses and cost containment actions.
 
                 
On a U.S. GAAP basis, net income totaled $79.8 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with $95.1 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2010.

Fourth-quarter 2011 EBITDA was lowered by selected charges of $79.8 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of the ING REIM businesses and cost containment actions.
 
Management Commentary
 
"2011 was a year of unexpectedly tough operating conditions in many parts of the world, particularly in the back-half of the year.  Nevertheless, we recorded our second-best year ever for both revenues and normalized EBITDA, enhanced our platform with the ING REIM acquisitions and strategic recruiting, and made other investments that will further position CBRE for leadership across market cycles," said Brett White, chief executive officer of CBRE.
 
"Our highly diversified platform was the key to our fourth quarter results," Mr. White continued.  "The macro-environment during this period was marked by intensified concerns about sovereign debt issues, particularly in Europe, and tepid economic growth.  This challenge, however, was offset by out-sized gains from our development portfolio, strong growth in outsourcing globally, resilience in our capital markets businesses, as well as actions taken to more carefully manage expenses. As a result, quarterly EBITDA margins reached their highest levels since the second quarter of 2007."
 
Double-digit growth in all regions fueled a 14% rise in outsourcing revenue globally. This was the business line's 5th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth  in part, due to the Company's ability to take advantage of outsourcing's growing acceptance in both international markets and new economic sectors.  For example, during the fourth quarter of 2011, CBRE was awarded multi-year contracts to provide services for Unilever in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Eastern Europe; and Newell-Rubbermaid in Asia Pacific. In Europe, the Company was retained by the United Kingdom Commonwealth Office, an example of its growing portfolio of public sector outsourcing clients.
 
The Company also continued to add significant global mandates, and recently broke new ground with the outsourcing industry's first global real estate integrator contract.  Microsoft Corporation has selected CBRE to serve as global integrator of services for the company's 34 million square foot global portfolio.  Under this contractMicrosoft has retained CBRE to perform real estate strategy and portfolio planning, property management and lease administration; to engage and manage multiple other service partners in the delivery of transaction, construction and facilities management services; and to partner with Microsoft to build an industry-leading commercial real estate IT platform.
,
Overall, CBRE signed 33 total outsourcing contracts in the fourth quarter, increasing the number of contracts for the year to 173  a new single-year record for the Company.
 
Global property sales revenue rose 10%, paced by solid growth in both the Americas and Asia Pacific, while EMEA was relatively flat.  In 2011, CBRE once again achieved the #1 market share in investment sales activity in both the U.S. and the U.K.  In addition, the Mortgage Brokerage business, mainly centered in the U.S., saw revenue improve by 25% during the quarter.
 
Global property leasing revenue fell moderately, as double-digit growth in EMEA  despite soft economies across much of Europe  was offset by a decline in the Americas. The Americas decline was in part due to a tough comparison with the fourth quarter of 2010, when leasing revenue was 45% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Asia Pacific's leasing revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011 was relatively flat.
 
Fourth quarter results were enhanced by significant contributions from the Development Services business. The sale of two high-quality assets in the Houston and Dallas markets drove a sizable EBITDA improvement for this segment during the quarter.
 
Global Investment Management revenue improved 31% during the fourth quarter.  This included revenue from the ING REIM businesses in Europe and Asia that were acquired this quarter, and the ING global listed real estate securities business that was acquired on July 1, 2011.
 
Fourth-Quarter 2011 Segment Results
 
Americas Region
(U.S., Canada and Latin America)
 
                 
Revenue rose 3% to $1.1 billion, compared with $1.0 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010.
                 
EBITDA before selected charges totaled $158.2 million, up 18% from $133.5 million in last year's fourth quarter. Including these charges, EBITDA increased 12% to $142.5 million.
                 
Operating income rose 11% to $119.1 million from $107.4 million for the prior-year fourth quarter.
Current-period operating income was impacted by $15.6 million of cost containment expenses.
 
EMEA Region
(primarily Europe)
 
                 
Revenue rose 9% to $334.6 million from $307.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase was driven by growth in northern continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
                 
EBITDA before selected charges totaled $53.1 million, an increase of 12% compared with $47.6 million in last year's fourth quarter. Including these charges, EBITDA totaled $42.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
                 
Operating income was $39.0 million, compared with $45.4 million for the same period in 2010.
Current-period operating income was impacted by $11.1 million of cost containment expenses.
Asia Pacific Region
(Asia, Australia and New Zealand)
 
                 
Revenue rose 11% to $231.7 million from $209.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.  The increase reflects improved performance in several countries, particularly Australia, India and Japan.

Operating income was $27.3 million, compared with $33.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Current-period operating income was impacted by $4.4 million of cost containment expenses.
 
Global Investment Management Business
(investment management operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia)
 
                 
Revenue increased 31% to $104.8 million from $79.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The fourth quarter of 2011 benefited from approximately $60.0 million of revenue from the ING REIM businesses. No carried interest revenue was recognized, while last year's fourth quarter included $19.9 million of carried interest revenue from a fund liquidation. The current-year period also produced lower acquisition fees and rental revenues (due to property dispositions) than a year ago.
                 
EBITDA before selected charges totaled $16.5 million compared with $27.3 million in the prior-year fourth quarter. Including these charges, EBITDA reflected a loss of $29.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
                 
Operating loss totaled $41.4 million, compared with operating income of $13.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. Current-period operating loss was affected by $45.0 million of expenses related to the acquisition of ING REIM.
                 
Current-period EBITDA, excluding and including selected charges, and operating results were affected by a net carried interest incentive compensation accrual of $10.5 million. In the prior-year's fourth quarter, the carried interest incentive compensation accrual totaled $19.8 million. Positive contributions from ING REIM in the fourth quarter of 2011 were offset by higher equity earnings and the reversal of a doubtful-account provision in the prior-year fourth quarter.
                 
Assets under management totaled $94.1 billion, representing a 150% increase from year-end 2010, mainly due to the ING REIM acquisitions.
 
Development Services
(real estate development and investment activities primarily in the U.S.)
 
                 
Revenue rose 21% to $21.1 million compared with $17.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.
                 
Operating loss totaled $27.3 million as compared with an operating loss of $26.8 million for the same period in 2010.
                 
EBITDA improved sharply to $49.4 million from $5.4 million in the prior-year period. The increase was driven by gains on the sale of properties, the majority of which was reported as equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and income from discontinued operations this quarter. These gains were partially offset by non-controlling interests activity. Equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries, income from discontinued operations and activity associated with non-controlling interests are all included in the calculation of EBITDA, but not in revenue or operating income.
                 
Selected charges in the fourth quarters of both 2011 and 2010 were not significant.
                 
Development projects in process totaled $4.9 billion and the inventory of pipeline deals totaled $1.2 billion, both unchanged from year-end 2010.
 
2012 Outlook
 
"The global real estate market remains in recovery as we enter 2012. The pace of recovery, however, remains slow and inconsistent, restrained by sub-par economic growth and job creation in much of the world as well as Europe's sovereign debt issues," Mr. White said.  "Despite these challenges, we expect that our premier people, brand, global platform, and vigilance around cost control will help us drive both improved financial performance for our shareholders and superior results for our clients in 2012."
 
The Company has set its expectations for 2012 based on the above-mentioned factors as well as anticipated increases in interest, depreciation and amortization expense, mostly resulting from the ING REIM acquisition.  In light of this, CBRE expects that earnings per share, as adjusted, will be in the range of $1.20 to $1.25 in 2012.

(1) Selected charges include integration and other costs related to acquisitions, cost containment expenses, amortization expense related to customer relationships acquired in the ING REIM and Trammell Crow Company (TCC) acquisitions, the write-down of impaired assets and the write-off of financing costs.
 
(2) A reconciliation of net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. to net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc., as adjusted for selected charges, is provided in the section of this press release entitled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
 
(3) EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, while amounts shown for EBITDA, as adjusted, (or normalized EBITDA) remove the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions, cost containment and asset impairments.  Our management believes that both of these measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculations of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, generally eliminate the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.  As a result, our management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs. Additionally, we believe EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations.
 
However, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not recognized measurements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management's discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amounts shown for EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
 
For a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted to net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc., the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
 
 
(1) Includes EBITDA related to discontinued operations of $12.2 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively and $14.1 million and $16.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
 
(1)
         
Includes EBITDA related to discontinued operations of $2.1 million and $4.0 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2011.
(2)
         
Includes EBITDA related to discontinued operations of $10.1 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively and $10.1 million and $16.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
The following measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC guidelines:
 
(i)
                                    
Net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc., as adjusted for selected charges
 
(ii)
                                 
Diluted income per share attributable to CBRE Group, Inc, as adjusted for selected charges
 
(iii)
                              
EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted for selected charges
 
The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of current results to prior periods as well as presenting the effects of selected charges in all periods presented.  The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of its business.
