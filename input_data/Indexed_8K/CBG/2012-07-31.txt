FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
Los Angeles, CA  July 31, 2012  CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBG) today reported strong revenue and earnings growth for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012.
 
Second-Quarter 2012 Results
     
Revenue for the quarter totaled $1.6 billion, an increase of 13% from $1.4 billion in the second quarter of 2011.
 
     
Excluding selected charges(1), net income(2) totaled $88.0 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the current quarter, up 31% and 29%, respectively, from $67.0 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2011. Selected charges (net of income taxes), which primarily related to the ING REIM businesses acquired in 2011, totaled $12.1 million and $5.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
 
     
On a U.S. GAAP basis, net income totaled $75.9 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2012, an increase of 24% and 21%, respectively, from $61.2 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2011.

EBITDA(3) (including selected charges) also rose 28% to $211.8 million for the second quarter of 2012, from $166.1 million for the same period last year. Selected charges, which primarily related to the acquisition of the ING REIM businesses in 2011, reduced EBITDA by $9.1 million and $6.3 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
 
Management Commentary
"CBRE's key strengths  people, brand and diverse platform  served us well amid elevated global economic uncertainty during the second quarter," said Brett White, the Company's chief executive officer. "Despite tepid economic growth around the world, we once again produced double-digit revenue gains, with notably strong performance in the Americas, solid growth in Asia Pacific, and increased contributions from our global investment management operations. As we execute our growth strategy, we continue to be highly focused on cost discipline as well, which also contributed to significant bottom-line improvement during the quarter."
 
 
Global revenue rose during the quarter in every business line. CBRE's capital markets businesses performed very well, particularly in the Americas. Global property sales revenue increased 16%, with all regions showing improvement. The Americas set the pace with a 23% rise in property sales revenue. Both EMEA and Asia Pacific posted modest increases, notwithstanding the ongoing euro zone financial difficulties and slowing economic activity in both regions.  Mortgage brokerage (predominantly an Americas business) saw revenue climb 36%, reflecting continued improvement in the U.S. debt financing market.
 
Global investment management operations continued to make significant contributions to the Company's overall performance, bolstered by the ING REIM acquisitions in the second half of 2011.  Revenue from this business line more than doubled compared with a year earlier. Overall, global investment management accounted for 7% of total Company revenue and 13% of normalized EBITDA  up from approximately 4% of both revenue and normalized EBITDA in the second quarter of 2011.
 
Outsourcing revenue rose by double digits for the seventh consecutive quarter, with a 10% increase globally. The Company continues to on-board new outsourcing clients at a brisk pace, with 24 new contracts signed during the period  a Company record for one quarter. Among these new clients are three each in the healthcare and government sectors  vertical markets that the Company has targeted for growth opportunities  as well as major corporate wins with Monsanto, Samsung and SONY. All told, CBRE signed 54 outsourcing contracts  renewals, new clients and expansions of existing relationships  during the second quarter of 2012.
 
On a global basis, leasing revenue increased slightly, reflecting generally soft market conditions in many parts of the world.  Despite these challenges, the Americas and Asia Pacific produced moderate leasing revenue growth.
 
During the second quarter, the Company enhanced its commercial real estate services platform in EMEA with the acquisition of its former affiliate in Turkey, one of the world's fastest-growing economies.
 
"The recovery continues to progress, but at a historically slow pace and with a high degree of inconsistency and uncertainty across global markets and business lines," Mr. White said. "Nevertheless, CBRE has a history of performing well for clients amid these market conditions. We are therefore cautiously optimistic about our business, and remain comfortable with our ability to deliver on the full-year earnings per share outlook we announced early this year."
 
Second-Quarter 2012 Segment Results
 
Americas Region
(U.S., Canada and Latin America)
     
Revenue rose 13% to $1.0 billion, compared with $897.8 million for the second quarter of 2011.
     
EBITDA totaled $149.3 million, up 29% from $115.4 million in last year's second quarter.
     
Operating income rose 30% to $127.9 million from $98.2 million for the prior-year second quarter.
 
     
Improved revenue was evident in all business lines across the region.
 
EMEA Region
(primarily Europe)
     
Revenue totaled $248.2 million, compared with $261.1 million for the second quarter of 2011.
     
In line with the revenue trend, the region reported EBITDA of $15.7 million compared with $21.4 million in the prior year second quarter.
     
Operating income totaled $12.6 million, compared with $18.9 million for the same period in 2011.
     
The weaker results reflected the impact of Europe's continuing economic difficulties related to sovereign debt issues as well as the effect of negative currency movement. While the region experienced lower leasing activity, sales revenue improved modestly, despite the macro environment and effects of currency.
     
Total revenue grew modestly in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, but this was offset by reduced revenue in other countries, most notably in France, which had a particularly strong second quarter in 2011.
 
Asia Pacific Region
(Asia, Australia and New Zealand)
     
Revenue rose 7% to $201.2 million from $188.5 million for the second quarter of 2011.
     
EBITDA totaled $23.3 million, up 34% from $17.4 million in last year's second quarter.
     
Operating income rose 30% to $20.7 million, compared with $16.0 million for the second quarter of 2011.
     
The improved results reflect higher revenues in Australia, India, Japan and Singapore.
 
Global Investment Management Business
(investment management operations in the U.S., Europe and Asia)
     
Revenue more than doubled to $119.7 million from $57.6 million in the second quarter of 2011.
     
EBITDA, before selected charges, totaled $29.8 million, up from $7.3 million in the prior-year second quarter. Including these charges, current-quarter EBITDA rose to $20.7 million from $2.5 million in the second quarter of 2011.
     
Operating income totaled $12.9 million, compared with an operating loss of $3.6 million for the second quarter of 2011.
     
The improved revenue, EBITDA and operating performance were in large part driven by contributions from the ING REIM businesses acquired in the second half of 2011.
     
Assets under management totaled $91.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing a 3% decrease from year-end 2011. The decrease was caused, in part, by a non-traded REIT's decision to internalize its management.
 
Development Services
(real estate development and investment activities primarily in the U.S.)
     
Revenue increased slightly to $17.8 million, compared with $17.2 million for the second quarter of 2011.
     
Operating loss totaled $1.4 million as compared with operating income of $0.7 million for the same period in 2011.
     
EBITDA totaled $2.8 million, compared with $9.4 million in the prior-year period. Second-quarter 2011 EBITDA benefited from gains on the sale of properties (reflected in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and gain on disposition of real estate, partially offset by non-controlling interests activity), which did not occur to the same extent in the current quarter.  Equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and non-controlling interests are included in the calculation of EBITDA, but not in operating income.
 
     
Development projects in process totaled $4.7 billion, down $0.2 billion from year-end 2011.  The inventory of pipeline deals totaled $1.4 billion, up $0.2 billion from year-end 2011.

Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2012 totaled $3.0 billion, an increase of 13% from $2.6 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2011.
     
Excluding selected charges(1), net income(2) totaled $133.9 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the current-year-to-date period, up 25% and 24%, respectively, from $107.6 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Selected charges (net of income taxes), primarily related to the ING REIM businesses acquired in 2011, totaled $31.1 million and $12.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
     
On a U.S. GAAP basis, net income totaled $102.8 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2012, an increase of 8% and 7%, respectively, from $95.6 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the same period in 2011.
     
Excluding selected charges, EBITDA increased 27% to $371.4 million for the first six months of 2012 from $292.9 million a year earlier. EBITDA (including selected charges) rose 26% to $352.3 million for the current six-month period, from $279.1 million for the same period a year earlier.

Additional information concerning factors that may influence the Company's financial information is discussed under "Risk Factors", "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and "Forward-Looking Statements" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and "Forward-Looking Statements" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, as well as in the Company's press releases and other periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(1) Selected charges include integration and other costs related to acquisitions and amortization expense related to incentive fees and customer relationships acquired in the ING REIM and Trammell Crow Company (TCC) acquisitions.
 
(2) A reconciliation of net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. to net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc., as adjusted for selected charges, is provided in the section of this press release entitled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
 
(3) EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, while amounts shown for EBITDA, as adjusted (or normalized EBITDA), remove the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions.  Our management believes that both of these measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculations of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, generally eliminate the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.  As a result, our management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes, including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs. Additionally, we believe EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations.
 
However, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not recognized measurements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management's discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amounts shown for EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted, also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.
 
For a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted to net income attributable to CBRE Group, Inc., the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the section of this press release titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
 
(1) Includes EBITDA related to discontinued operations of $0.8 million and $1.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2011, respectively.

The following measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" under SEC guidelines:

(iii)
                              
EBITDA and EBITDA, as adjusted for selected charges
 
The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of current results to prior periods as well as presenting the effects of selected charges in all periods presented.  The Company believes that investors may find it useful to see these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze financial performance without the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of its business.
