VIACOM UPDATES BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR 2003 New York, New York, September 24, 2003 - Viacom Inc. (NYSE: VIA, VIA.B) announced today that it is updating its full year 2003 business outlook. Viacom said that while the economic recovery has translated into robust national advertising sales growth, the pace of recovery in local advertising markets going into the fourth quarter is not as rapid as had been anticipated. The Company said it now expects to deliver mid- to high-single digit growth in revenues and operating income for the full year, versus its earlier guidance of high single-digit growth for revenues and double-digit growth for operating income. In addition, Viacom now expects to deliver low- to mid-teen growth in net earnings (before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle) and earnings per share for full year 2003, versus its earlier guidance of mid-teen growth. Viacom continues to expect a record year for revenues, operating income, net earnings (before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle) and earnings per share in 2003, as well as strong growth for 2004. The Company is extremely well-positioned to reap the benefits of an expected improvement in local advertising markets in 2004, driven by an improving economy, political advertising, and the Super Bowl on CBS. Viacom is a leading global media company, with preeminent positions in broadcast and cable television, radio, outdoor advertising, and online. With programming that appeals to audiences in every demographic category across virtually all media, the Company is a leader in the creation, promotion, and distribution of entertainment, news, sports, music, and comedy. Viacom's well-known brands include CBS, MTV, Nickelodeon, VH1, BET, Paramount Pictures, Viacom Outdoor, Infinity Broadcasting, UPN, Spike TV, TV Land, CMT: Country Music Television, Comedy Central, Showtime, Blockbuster, and Simon & Schuster.
