1.
            
Duties
 
As Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Viacom, you shall have all the rights, powers, authority, functions, duties and responsibilities customarily associated with such titles, and such additional rights, powers, authority, functions, duties and responsibilities as the Board may assign to you from time to time that are commensurate with your status as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

2.
            
Compensation
 
:  For all the services rendered by you in any capacity hereunder, Viacom agrees to pay you the sum of Three Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,500,000) per annum ("Salary"), payable in accordance with Viacom's then effective payroll practices but no less frequently than semi-monthly.

Compensation for the six (6) month period from July 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004 shall equal One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), based on an annualized rate of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000).

Deferred Compensation shall be credited to a bookkeeping account maintained by Viacom on your behalf, the balance of which account shall periodically be credited (or debited) with deemed positive (or negative) return calculated in the same manner, and at the same times, as the deemed return on your account under the Viacom Excess 401(k) Plan for Senior Executives (as such plan may be amended from time to time, the "Excess 401(k) Plan") is determined (it being understood and agreed that, if at any time during which the Deferred Compensation remains payable, your account balance in the Excess 401(k) Plan is distributed in full to you, your Deferred Compensation account shall continue to be credited or debited with a deemed return based on the investment portfolio in which your Excess 401(k) Plan account was notionally invested immediately prior to its distribution).

Bonus Compensation
 
Your Bonus for each of the calendar years or portion thereof during your employment with Viacom will be based upon achievement of the performance goal established by the Viacom Compensation Committee for each calendar year and partial calendar year performance period during your employment with Viacom and shall be determined, in accordance with the Viacom Senior Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Senior Executive STIP"), which performance goal shall be no less favorable to you than the performance goal used to determine the amount of bonus payable to any other executive of Viacom who participates in the Senior Executive STIP.
(i)
           
 
Your Target Bonus for each of the calendar years or portion thereof during your employment with Viacom shall be 200% of your Salary and Deferred Compensation at the annualized rate in effect at the end of such period.  Your Bonus may be prorated for any partial calendar year that you are employed by Viacom under this Agreement.

Assuming the performance goal pre-established by the Viacom Compensation Committee for each calendar year or partial calendar year performance period during your employment with Viacom has been achieved and certified by the Committee, the Compensation Committee is entitled to use its negative discretion to reduce the amount of the Bonus that you are entitled to receive for such performance period.
(iii)
         
 
Your Bonus for any calendar year during your employment with Viacom shall be payable by February 28 of the following year.  For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that you will receive the Bonus to which you are entitled for each calendar year in which you were employed, even if you are not employed on February 28 of the following year or on the actual date on which bonuses are paid for such year.

In the event that the Senior Executive STIP is amended or terminated, you will be given an opportunity under the amended or successor plan to earn bonus compensation equivalent to the amount that you could have earned under this paragraph 2(c) but subject to the same limitations.

.  In addition to your Salary, Deferred Compensation and Bonus, you shall receive the following grants of long-term compensation under the Viacom 2004 Long-Term Management Incentive Plan (the "2004 LTMIP") or a successor plan (together with Viacom's 1994, 1997 and 2000 Long-Term Management Incentive Plans, collectively, the "LTMIP"):

Long Term Compensation
 
.  The Viacom Compensation Committee awarded you, on July 1, 2004, grants under the 2004 LTMIP to purchase an aggregate of One Million Five Hundred Thousand (1,500,000) shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock as follows:  (x) a grant of stock options to purchase Five Hundred Thousand (500,000) shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock that will vest on December 31, 2004; and (y) a grant of stock options to purchase One Million (1,000,000) shares of Class B Common Stock that will vest in four (4) equal installments on July 1, 2005, July 1, 2006, July 1, 2007 and July 1, 2008.

.  The Viacom Compensation Committee will award you four (4) grants under the LTMIP, each for 115,000 restricted share units ("Restricted Units"), during the first calendar quarter of 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008.  Each Restricted Unit will correspond to one (1) share of Viacom Class B Common Stock.  At the time of each grant, the Compensation Committee will establish a performance goal requirement for such award of Restricted Units for a performance period that will end no later than December 31 of the year in which the grant is made.  The Compensation Committee shall establish the same performance goal for each grant of Restricted Units that it establishes for the Senior Executive STIP for the performance period during which such grant of Restricted Units is awarded.  At the first Compensation Committee meeting held after the end of each performance period during which Restricted Units were awarded (which meeting is expected to be held in January), the Compensation Committee will determine whether the performance goal for each award of Restricted Units has been achieved.  If the Committee certifies that the performance goal established for an award of Restricted Units has been achieved, the award will vest and become payable as described below.  If the Compensation Committee finds that the goal established for any grant of Restricted Units has not been achieved, the award will not vest and will be cancelled.  The Restricted Units will be payable only in shares of Class B Common Stock.  Prior to the end of each calendar year during your employment with Viacom, you will have an option to defer receipt of payment of the Restricted Units that will be awarded during the following year; you can defer payment of such Restricted Units as follows:  (x) for up to ten (10) years after the Restricted Units vest for in-service distributions, and (y) for up to three (3) years after the termination of your Viacom employment for post-termination distributions.  If a timely election to defer is not made for any award of Restricted Units, payment of such Restricted Units will be made shortly after the Restricted Units vest.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, payment of each award of Restricted Units will be deferred to the date determined in accordance with paragraph 13 if such date is later than the date on which payment would otherwise be made.

The Compensation Committee shall establish the same performance goal for each grant of Restricted Units that it establishes for the Senior Executive STIP for the performance period during which such grant of Restricted Units is awarded.  At the first Compensation Committee meeting held after the end of each performance period during which Restricted Units were awarded (which meeting is expected to be held in January), the Compensation Committee will determine whether the performance goal for each award of Restricted Units has been achieved.  If the Committee certifies that the performance goal established for an award of Restricted Units has been achieved, the award will vest and become payable as described below.  If the Compensation Committee finds that the goal established for any grant of Restricted Units has not been achieved, the award will not vest and will be cancelled.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, payment of each award of Restricted Units will be deferred to the date determined in accordance with paragraph 20 if such date is later than the date on which payment would otherwise be made.

You shall be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in (i) and (ii) of this paragraph 8(c) by seeking other employment or otherwise (only to the extent required by law) and the amount of any such payment provided for in (i) and (ii) shall be reduced by any compensation earned by you after the termination of your employment and during or with respect to the Employment Term from a third person except that mitigation shall not be required, and no reduction for any other compensation shall be made, for the shorter of (x) thirty six (36) months after the termination of your employment pursuant to paragraph 8(b) or 8(c) or (y) the period commencing with the termination of your employment and ending on the last day of the Employment Term (the "Non-Mitigation Period").  The payments provided for in (i) above are in lieu of any severance or income continuation or protection under any Viacom plan that may now or hereafter exist.  The payments and benefits to be provided pursuant to this paragraph 8(d) shall constitute liquidated damages, and shall be deemed to satisfy and be in full and final settlement of all obligations of Viacom to you under this Agreement.
 
.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (except as otherwise provided in paragraphs 8(d) and (g) with respect to medical, dental and life insurance and the continued exercisability of stock options), coverage under all Viacom benefit plans and programs (including, without limitation, vacation, 401(k) and excess 401(k) plans, pension and excess pension plans, LTD, car insurance and accidental death and dismemberment and business travel and accident insurance) will terminate upon the termination of your employment except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in such plans or programs.

.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that it is determined by Viacom, or by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") pursuant to an IRS audit (an "Audit") of your federal income tax return(s), that any payment or benefit provided to you hereunder, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest or penalties thereon, is herein referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then Viacom shall pay (either directly to the IRS as tax withholdings or to you as a reimbursement of any amount of taxes, interest and penalties paid by you to the IRS) both the Excise Tax and an additional cash payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount that will place you in the same after-tax economic position that you would have enjoyed if the payment or benefit had not been subject to the Excise Tax.  Viacom will consult with its outside tax counsel at its expense, to the extent it reasonably deems appropriate, in making determinations pursuant to the preceding sentence.  The amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be calculated by Viacom's regular independent auditors based on the amount of the Excise Tax paid by Viacom as determined by Viacom or the IRS.  If the amount of the Excise Tax determined by the IRS is greater than an amount previously determined by Viacom, Viacom's auditors shall recalculate the amount of the Gross-Up Payment.  Viacom's auditors shall provide you with detailed support for its calculations.  Viacom shall be responsible for the fees and expenses incurred by its auditors in making these calculations.  You shall promptly notify Viacom of any IRS assertion during an Audit that an Excise Tax is due with respect to any payment or benefit, but you shall be under no obligation to defend against such claim by the IRS unless Viacom requests, in writing, that you undertake the defense of such IRS claim on behalf of Viacom and at Viacom's sole expense.  In such event, Viacom may elect to control the conduct to a final determination through counsel of its own choosing and at its sole expense, of any audit, administrative or judicial proceeding involving an asserted liability relating to the Excise Tax, and you shall not settle, compromise or concede such asserted Excise Tax and shall cooperate with Viacom in each phase of any contest.

EXHIBIT A
 
Mr. Freston's Prior Employment Agreement included the following provisions concerning stock options granted under Viacom's 1994, 1997 and 2000 Long-Term Management Incentive Plans (the "LTMIP")* which provisions remain in effect:
 
In the event that Mr. Freston's employment is terminated by Viacom without "cause" or by him for Good Reason, stock options granted to him under the LTMIP which were exercisable on or prior to the date of such termination of his employment, or that would have vested and become exercisable on or before the last day of the Employment Term, will be exercisable (x) for stock options granted before May 4, 2000, until six (6) months after the date of termination or, if earlier, the expiration date of such stock options, and (y) for stock options granted on or after May 4, 2000, for one (1) year after the date of such termination or, if earlier, the expiration date of such stock options.
 
In the event of Mr. Freston's permanent disability, stock options granted to him under the LTMIP which were exercisable on or prior to the date on which benefits commenced under Viacom's Long-Term Disability program, or that would have vested and become exercisable on or before the last day of his Employment Term, will be exercisable for one (1) year after the date as of which such benefits commenced or, if earlier, the expiration date of the stock options.
 
In the event of Mr. Freston's death, his beneficiary or estate is entitled to exercise stock options granted to him under the LTMIP which were exercisable on or prior to his death, or that would have vested and become exercisable on or prior to the last day of his Employment Term but for his death, for one (1) year after the date of death or, if earlier, the expiration date of such stock options.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As used in these provisions, "cause", Good Reason and Employment Term have the definitions provided in the employment agreement that applies to Mr. Freston on the date on which his employment terminates or his permanent disability or death occurs.  In the event that the LTMIP provides Mr. Freston with a longer period to exercise the stock options after the termination of his employment or in the event of his death, permanent disability or retirement than the period provided for in the Prior Employment Agreement, he will have the benefit of the longer period.

However, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude you from serving as a member of the Board of Directors of any charitable, educational, religious or entertainment industry trade, public interest or public service organization, in each instance not inconsistent with the business practices and policies of Viacom, or from devoting reasonable periods of time to the activities of the aforementioned organizations or from managing your personal investments; , that such activities do not materially interfere with the performance of your duties and responsibilities hereunder.  You will be Co-President and Co-Chief Operating Officer of Viacom, reporting directly and solely to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Viacom (the "Chairman, CEO"), and you agree to perform such duties, and such other duties reasonable and consistent with such offices as may be assigned to you from time to time by the Chairman, CEO.

Compensation
 
.  For all the services rendered by you in any capacity hereunder, Viacom agrees to pay you the sum of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) per annum ("Salary"), payable in accordance with Viacom's then effective payroll practices but no less frequently than semi-monthly.
(a)
      
Salary
 
.  In addition to your Salary, you shall earn, with respect to each payroll period during the Employment Term, additional amounts ("Deferred Compensation"), the payment of which (together with the return thereon as provided in this paragraph 3(b)), shall be deferred until January of the first calendar year following the year in which you cease to be an "executive officer" of Viacom, as defined by the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and payable at that time or at such later date as shall be determined pursuant to paragraph 20.  The Deferred Compensation for the six (6) month period from July 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004 shall equal One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), based on an annualized rate of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000).  The annualized rate of Deferred Compensation for each subsequent calendar year during the Employment Term shall be increased by Three Hundred

Thousand Dollars ($300,000) on each January 1 during the Employment Term, commencing January 1, 2005.  Deferred Compensation shall be credited to a bookkeeping account maintained by Viacom on your behalf, the balance of which account shall periodically be credited (or debited) with deemed positive (or negative) return calculated in the same manner, and at the same times, as the deemed return on your account under the Viacom Excess 401(k) Plan for Senior Executives  (as such plan may be amended from time to time, the "Excess 401(k) Plan") is determined (it being understood and agreed that, if at any time during which the Deferred Compensation remains payable, your account balance in the Excess 401(k) Plan is distributed in full to you, your Deferred Compensation account shall continue to be credited or debited with a deemed return based on the investment portfolio in which your Excess 401(k) Plan account was notionally invested immediately prior to its distribution).  Viacom's obligation to pay the Deferred Compensation (including the return thereon provided for in this paragraph 3(b)) shall be an unfunded obligation to be satisfied from the general funds of Viacom.
st
 
.  In addition to your Salary and Deferred Compensation, you shall be entitled to receive bonus compensation for each of the calendar years during the Employment Term, determined and payable as follows ("Bonus"):
(c)
      
Bonus Compensation
 
Your Bonus for each calendar year or portion thereof during the Employment Term will be based upon achievement of the performance goal established by the Viacom Compensation Committee for each calendar year or partial calendar year performance period during the Employment Term and shall be determined, in accordance with the Viacom Senior Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Senior Executive STIP"), which performance goal shall be no less favorable to you than the performance goal used to determine the amount of bonus payable to any other executive of Viacom who participates in the Senior Executive STIP.  You shall have meaningful input in the process regarding the determination of the performance goal with the Chairman and the Viacom Compensation Committee prior to the determination of such performance goal for the Senior Executive STIP for each performance period.
(i)
       
 
Your Target Bonus for each of the calendar years or portion thereof during the Employment Term shall be 200% of your Salary and Deferred Compensation at the annualized rate in effect at the end of such period.  For the 2004 calendar year, your bonus compensation for the entire year will be based on the sum of your Salary and Deferred Compensation at the annualized rate in effect

at the end of the year and the Senior Executive STIP performance goal established by the Viacom Compensation Committee for the period from July 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004.
 
Assuming the performance goal pre-established by the Viacom Compensation Committee for each calendar year or partial calendar year performance period during the Employment Term has been achieved and certified by the Committee, the Compensation Committee is entitled to use its negative discretion to reduce the amount of the Bonus that you are entitled to receive for such performance period but will not reduce your Bonus for any such period below the amount of the bonus compensation that you would have been entitled to receive if you had continued to participate in Viacom's Short-Term Incentive Plan, as the same may be amended from time to time (the "STIP"), for such period.  In addition, assuming the pre-established performance goal for the period from July 1, 2004 through December 31, 2004 has been achieved and certified by the Compensation Committee, in exercising its negative discretion to determine the amount of the Bonus that you will receive under the Senior Executive STIP for the 2004 calendar year, the Compensation Committee will give due consideration to the performance of the business units for which you were responsible during the first half of such year, including their achievement of their objectives under the STIP during such period.
(iii)
     
 
Your Bonus for any calendar year, including the last calendar year of the Employment Term, shall be payable by February 28 of the following year.  For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that you will receive the Bonus to which you are entitled for each calendar year in which you were employed, even if you are not employed on February 28 of the following year or on the actual date on which bonuses are paid for such year.  In the event that your employment under this Agreement terminates on or following the expiration of the Employment Term, you shall be entitled to receive a bonus for calendar year 2009, equal to your Target Bonus, prorated for the period of your employment during 2009 and payable by February 28, 2010.
(iv)

Stock Option Grants
 
.  The Viacom Compensation Committee will award you four (4) grants under the LTMIP, each for 115,000 restricted share units ("Restricted Units"), during the first calendar quarter of 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008.  Each Restricted Unit will correspond to one (1) share of Viacom Class B Common Stock.  At the time of each grant, the Compensation Committee will establish a performance goal requirement for such award of Restricted Units for a performance period that will end no later than December 31 of the year in which the grant was made.  The Compensation Committee shall establish the same performance goal for each grant of Restricted Units that it establishes for the Senior Executive STIP for the performance period during which such grant of Restricted Units is awarded.  At the first Compensation Committee meeting held after the end of each performance period during which Restricted Units were awarded (which meeting is expected to be held in January), the Compensation Committee will determine whether the performance goal for each award of Restricted Units has been achieved.  If the Committee certifies that the performance goal established for an award of Restricted Units has been achieved, the award will vest and become payable as described below.  If the Compensation Committee finds that the goal established for any grant of Restricted Units has not been achieved, the award will not vest and will be cancelled.  The Restricted Units will be payable only in

If a timely election to defer is not made for any award of Restricted Units, payment of such Restricted Units will be made shortly after the Restricted Units vest.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, payment of each award of Restricted Units will be deferred to the date determined in accordance with paragraph 20 if such date is later than the date on which payment would otherwise be made.

termination of your employment and ending on the last day of the Employment Term (the "Non-Mitigation Period").  The payments provided for in (i) above are in lieu of any severance or income continuation or protection under any Viacom plan that may now or hereafter exist.  The payments and benefits to be provided pursuant to this paragraph 8(d) shall constitute liquidated damages, and shall be deemed to satisfy and be in full and final settlement of all obligations of Viacom to you under this Agreement.
 
.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (except as otherwise provided in paragraphs 8(d) and (g) with respect to medical, dental and life insurance and the continued exercisability of stock options), coverage under all Viacom benefit plans and programs (including, without limitation, vacation, 401(k) and excess 401(k) plans, pension and excess pension plans, LTD, car insurance and accidental death and dismemberment and business travel and accident insurance) will terminate upon the termination of your employment except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in such plans or programs.
(e)
      
Termination of Benefits
 
.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that it is determined by Viacom, or by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") pursuant to an IRS audit (an "Audit") of your federal income tax return(s), that any payment or benefit provided to you hereunder, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest or penalties thereon, is herein referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then Viacom shall pay (either directly to the IRS as tax withholdings or to you as a reimbursement of any amount of taxes, interest and penalties paid by you to the IRS) both the Excise Tax and an additional cash payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount that will place you in the same after-tax economic position that you would have enjoyed if the payment or benefit had not been subject to the Excise Tax.  Viacom will consult with its outside tax counsel at its expense, to the extent it reasonably deems appropriate, in making determinations pursuant to the preceding sentence.  The amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be calculated by Viacom's regular independent auditors based on the amount of the Excise Tax paid by Viacom as determined by Viacom or the IRS.  If the amount of the Excise Tax determined by the IRS is greater than an amount previously determined by Viacom, Viacom's auditors shall recalculate the amount of the Gross-Up Payment.  Viacom's auditors shall provide you with detailed support for its calculations.  Viacom shall be responsible for the fees and expenses incurred by its auditors in making these calculations.  You shall promptly notify Viacom of any IRS assertion during an Audit that an Excise Tax is due with respect to any payment or benefit, but you shall be under no obligation to defend against such claim by the IRS unless Viacom requests, in writing, that you undertake the defense of such IRS claim on behalf of Viacom and at Viacom's sole expense.  In such event, Viacom may elect to control the conduct to a final determination through counsel of its own choosing and at its sole expense, of any audit, administrative or judicial proceeding involving an asserted liability relating to the Excise

Tax, and you shall not settle, compromise or concede such asserted Excise Tax and shall cooperate with Viacom in each phase of any contest.
