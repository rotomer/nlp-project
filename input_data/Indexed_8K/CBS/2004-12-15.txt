Section 1-Registrant's Business and Operations Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. Deferred Compensation Plans. On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors of Viacom Inc. ("Viacom" or the "Company") authorized the future modification of the Company's deferred compensation plans (the "Plans"), including the amendment of existing plans or adoption of new plans, to comply with the new requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A set forth in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the final guidance on which is pending. Among the affected plans are the Viacom Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, under which Viacom directors may elect to participate, and the Viacom Excess 401(k) Plan for Designated Senior Executives and Viacom Bonus Deferral Plan for Designated Senior Executives, under which Viacom's executive officers may elect to participate. The material terms of the Plans, which are exhibits to Viacom's 2003 Form 10-K, will not change except to the extent required to comply with the requirements of Section 409A. A form of election form relating to the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors pursuant to which Viacom's directors will make their 2005 elections is attached hereto as Exhibit 10. Director Compensation. On December 9, 2004, the Board of Directors dissolved its Nominating Committee, assigning its responsibilities to the Corporate Governance Committee and renaming that committee the "Nominating and Governance Committee." All of the members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are independent directors under the New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Listing Standards. In addition, the Board approved changes to the compensation for members of its Compensation Committee and set the compensation for its newly formed Strategic Planning Committee and recently formed Ad Hoc Committee. Including these December 9th actions, the current cash compensation for outside directors serving on the Viacom Board of Directors is as follows: o Outside directors receive an annual retainer of $60,000, payable in equal installments quarterly in advance, plus a per meeting fee of $2,000; o The Chairs of the Audit, Compensation, Strategic Planning and Ad Hoc Committees each receive an annual retainer of $20,000, payable in equal installments quarterly in advance, and the members of those committees receive a per meeting fee of $2,000; and o The Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee receives an annual retainer of $15,000, payable in equal installments quarterly in advance, and the members of that committee receive a per meeting fee of $1,500.
"Outside directors" are those members of the Viacom Board of Directors who are not employees of Viacom, National Amusements or any of their respective subsidiaries, or an immediate family member of such persons. Directors may elect to defer their cash compensation under the Viacom Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, or any successor plan. In addition, as previously disclosed, under the terms of the Viacom Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors, which is an exhibit to Viacom's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2004, outside directors automatically receive a one-time grant of 10,000 stock options on the date the director joins the Board, which options vest one year from the date of grant, and an annual grant of 4,000 stock options on January 31 of each year, which options vest in equal installments over a period of four years. The exercise price of the stock options is the closing price of Viacom's Class B common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (or such other exchange on which the Class B common stock may then be listed) on the date of the stock option grant.
