Section 1--Registrant's Business and Operations Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. The information set forth below under Item 2.03 is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01. Section 2--Financial Information Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant. On May 12, 2005, Viacom Inc. ("Viacom" or the "Company") entered into a $2.5 billion 18-month revolving credit agreement (the "Facility") with a syndicate of financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Citibank, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and Bank of America, N.A., Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc., and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., New York Branch, as Co-Documentation Agents. Viacom International Inc. acts as guarantor for the Facility. Viacom has the ability to designate subsidiary borrowers under the Facility for which Viacom will act as guarantor. The Facility contains provisions substantially identical to those in Viacom's existing revolving credit facilities. Borrowing rates under the Facility are determined at the Company's option at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on the prime rate in the United States or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a specified margin. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments under the Facility. The Facility contains covenants which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Facility will expire on the earlier to occur of (i) the possible division of Viacom's businesses into separate publicly-traded companies (as such event is defined in the Facility) and (ii) November 10, 2006. Borrowings under the Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, commercial paper backup and repayment of existing bonds. It is expected that the Company will borrow under the Facility from time to time. In addition, on May 12, 2005, Viacom entered into amendments (the "Amendments") to its existing $3.0 billion five-year credit agreement, dated as of February 19, 2004, and $1.5 billion five-year credit agreement, dated as of March 7, 2001, to conform certain provisions of such agreements to provisions of the Facility. The foregoing descriptions of the Facility and the Amendments are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of the respective documents, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Some of the financial institutions party to the Facility and the Amendments and their affiliates have performed, and may in the future perform, various commercial banking, investment banking and other financial advisory services in the ordinary course of business for Viacom and its subsidiaries for which they have received, and will receive, customary fees and commissions. 2

20 attributable to any Indebtedness of Viacom or any Subsidiary repaid, repurchased, defeased or otherwise discharged with respect to Viacom and its Subsidiaries in connection with such Material Disposition (or, if the Capital Stock of any Subsidiary is sold, the Consolidated Interest Expense for such Test Period directly attributable to the Indebtedness of such Subsidiary to the extent Viacom and its continuing Subsidiaries are no longer liable for such Indebtedness after such Disposition); (ii) if during such Pro Forma Period Viacom or any Subsidiary shall have made a Material Acquisition, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such Test Period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto (including the incurrence or assumption of any Indebtedness in connection therewith) as if such Material Acquisition (and the incurrence or assumption of any such Indebtedness) occurred on the first day of such Test Period; and (iii) if during such Pro Forma Period any Person that subsequently became a Subsidiary or was merged with or into Viacom or any Subsidiary since the beginning of such Pro Forma Period shall have entered into any disposition or acquisition transaction that would have required an adjustment pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above if made by Viacom or a Subsidiary during such Pro Forma Period, Consolidated EBITDA and Consolidated Interest Expense for such Test Period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such transaction occurred on the first day of such Test Period. For the purposes of this paragraph, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a Material Disposition or Material Acquisition, the amount of income or earnings relating thereto and the amount of Consolidated Interest Expense associated with any Indebtedness discharged or incurred in connection therewith, the pro forma calculations shall be determined in good faith by a Financial Officer of Viacom. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and the incurrence or assumption thereof is being given pro forma effect, the interest expense on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the last day of the relevant Pro Forma Period had been the applicable rate for the entire relevant Test Period (taking into account any interest rate protection agreement applicable to such Indebtedness if such interest rate protection agreement has a remaining term in excess of 12 months). Comparable adjustments shall be made in connection with any determination of Consolidated EBITDA. (d) For purposes of the Financial Covenant, (i) the Discontinued Operations shall be disregarded and (ii) the businesses classified as Discontinued Operations shall be limited to those businesses treated as such in the financial statements of Viacom referred to in the definition of "Discontinued Operations" and the accounting treatment of Discontinued Operations shall be consistent with the accounting treatment thereof in such financial statements.

SECTION 2.3. Competitive Bid Procedure. (a) In order to request Competitive Bids, the relevant Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy to the Administrative Agent a duly completed Competitive Bid Request in the form of Exhibit B-1, to be received by the Administrative Agent (i) in the case of a Eurocurrency Competitive Loan in Dollars, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, four Business Days before a proposed Competitive Loan, (ii) in the case of a Eurocurrency Competitive Loan in a Foreign Currency, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, five Business Days before a proposed Competitive Loan, (iii) in the case of an Absolute Rate Loan in Dollars, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before a proposed Competitive Loan and (iv) in the case of an Absolute Rate Loan in a Foreign Currency, not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Day before a proposed Competitive Loan. A Competitive Bid Request (A) that does not conform
22 substantially to the format of Exhibit B-1 may be rejected in the Administrative Agent's discretion (exercised in good faith), and (B) for a Competitive Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency will be rejected by the Administrative Agent if, after giving effect thereto, the Dollar equivalent of the aggregate face amount of all Competitive Loans denominated in Foreign Currencies then outstanding would exceed $150,000,000, as determined by the Administrative Agent, and, in each case, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower of such rejection by telephone, confirmed by telecopier. Such request shall in each case refer to this Agreement and specify (w) whether the Competitive Loan then being requested is to be a Eurocurrency Competitive Loan or an Absolute Rate Loan, (x) the currency, (y) the date of such Loan (which shall be a Business Day) and the aggregate principal amount thereof which shall be in a minimum principal amount of the equivalent of $5,000,000 and, in the case of a Competitive Bid for a Competitive Loan in Dollars, in an integral multiple of $1,000,000, and (z) the Interest Period with respect thereto (which may not end after the Revolving Credit Maturity Date). Promptly after its receipt of a Competitive Bid Request that is not rejected as aforesaid (and in any event by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of such receipt if such receipt occurs by the time specified in the first sentence of this paragraph), the Administrative Agent shall invite by telecopier (in the form set forth in Exhibit B-2) the Lenders to bid, on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to make Competitive Loans pursuant to such Competitive Bid Request. (b) Each Lender may, in its sole discretion, make one or more Competitive Bids to the relevant Borrower responsive to a Competitive Bid Request. Each Competitive Bid must be received by the Administrative Agent by telecopier, in the form of Exhibit B-3, (i) in the case of a Eurocurrency Competitive Loan in Dollars, not later than 9:30 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before a proposed Competitive Loan, (ii) in the case of a Eurocurrency Competitive Loan in a Foreign Currency, not later than 9:30 a.m., New York City time, four Business Days before a proposed Competitive Loan, (iii) in the case of an Absolute Rate Loan in Dollars, not later than 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Competitive Loan, and (iv) in the case of an Absolute Rate Loan in a Foreign Currency, not later than 9:30 a.m., New York City time, two Business Days before a proposed Competitive Loan. Multiple Competitive Bids will be accepted by the Administrative Agent. Competitive Bids that do not conform substantially to the format of Exhibit B-3 may be rejected by the Administrative Agent after conferring with, and upon the instruction of, the relevant Borrower, and the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lender making such nonconforming Competitive Bid of such rejection as soon as practicable. Each Competitive Bid shall refer to this Agreement and specify (x) the principal amount in the relevant currency (which shall be in a minimum principal amount of the equivalent of $5,000,000 and, in the case of a Competitive Bid for a Competitive Loan in Dollars, in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and which may equal the entire principal amount of the Competitive Loan requested by the relevant Borrower) of the Competitive Loan or Loans that the applicable Lender is willing to make to the relevant Borrower, (y) the Competitive Bid Rate or Rates at which such Lender is prepared to make the Competitive Loan or Loans and (z) the Interest Period and the last day thereof. A Competitive Bid submitted pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be irrevocable (subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to borrowing set forth in Article IV). (c) The Administrative Agent shall promptly (and in any event by 10:15 a.m., New York City time, on the date on which such Competitive Bids shall have been made) notify
23 the relevant Borrower by telecopier of all the Competitive Bids made, the Competitive Bid Rate and the principal amount in the relevant currency of each Competitive Loan in respect of which a Competitive Bid was made and the identity of the Lender that made each Competitive Bid. The Administrative Agent shall send a copy of all Competitive Bids to the relevant Borrower for its records as soon as practicable after completion of the bidding process set forth in this Section 2.3. (d) The relevant Borrower may in its sole and absolute discretion, subject only to the provisions of this paragraph (d), accept or reject any Competitive Bid referred to in paragraph (c) above. The relevant Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone, confirmed by telecopier in such form as may be agreed upon by such Borrower and the Administrative Agent, whether and to what extent it has decided to accept or reject any of or all the Competitive Bids referred to in paragraph (c) above, (i) in the case of a Eurocurrency Competitive Loan in Dollars, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before a proposed Competitive Loan, (ii) in the case of a Eurocurrency Competitive Loan in a Foreign Currency, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, four Business Days before a proposed Competitive Loan, (iii) in the case of an Absolute Rate Loan in Dollars, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Competitive Loan, and (iv) in the case of an Absolute Rate Loan in a Foreign Currency, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day before a proposed Competitive Loan; provided, however, that (A) the failure by such Borrower to give such notice shall be deemed to be a rejection of all the Competitive Bids referred to in paragraph (c) above, (B) such Borrower shall not accept a Competitive Bid made at a particular Competitive Bid Rate if it has decided to reject a Competitive Bid made at a lower Competitive Bid Rate, (C) the aggregate amount of the Competitive Bids accepted by such Borrower shall not exceed the principal amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request (but may be less than that requested), (D) if such Borrower shall accept a Competitive Bid or Competitive Bids made at a particular Competitive Bid Rate but the amount of such Competitive Bid or Competitive Bids shall cause the total amount of Competitive Bids to be accepted by it to exceed the amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request, then such Borrower shall accept a portion of such Competitive Bid or Competitive Bids in an amount equal to the amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request less the amount of all other Competitive Bids accepted with respect to such Competitive Bid Request, which acceptance, in the case of multiple Competitive Bids at such Competitive Bid Rate, shall be made pro rata in accordance with the amount of each such Competitive Bid at such Competitive Bid Rate, and (E) except pursuant to clause (D) above no Competitive Bid shall be accepted for a Competitive Loan unless such Competitive Loan is in a minimum principal amount of the equivalent of $5,000,000 and, in the case of a Competitive Bid for a Competitive Loan in Dollars, an integral multiple of $1,000,000; provided, further, however, that if a Competitive Loan must be in an amount less than the equivalent of $5,000,000 because of the provisions of clause (D) above, such Competitive Loan may be for a minimum of, in the case of a Competitive Bid for a Competitive Loan in Dollars, $1,000,000 or any integral multiple thereof, and in calculating the pro rata allocation of acceptances of portions of multiple Competitive Bids at a particular Competitive Bid Rate pursuant to clause (D) above the amounts shall be rounded to integral multiples of the equivalent of $1,000,000 (or, in the case of a Competitive Bid for a Competitive Loan in a Foreign Currency, a multiple selected by the Administrative Agent) in a manner which shall be in the discretion of such Borrower. A notice given by any Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (d) shall be irrevocable.
24 (e) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each bidding Lender whether or not its Competitive Bid has been accepted (and if so, in what amount and at what Competitive Bid Rate) by telecopy sent by the Administrative Agent, and each successful bidder will thereupon become bound, subject to the other applicable conditions hereof, to make the Competitive Loan in respect of which its Competitive Bid has been accepted. (f) On the date the Competitive Loan is to be made, each Lender participating therein shall (i) if such Competitive Loan is to be made in Dollars, make available its share of such Competitive Loan in Dollars not later than 2:00 p.m. New York City time, in immediately available funds, in New York to the Administrative Agent as notified by the Administrative Agent by two Business Days notice and (ii) if such Competitive Loan is to be made in a Foreign Currency, make available its share of such Competitive Loan in such Foreign Currency not later than 11:00 a.m. London time, in immediately available funds, in London to the Administrative Agent as notified by the Administrative Agent by one Business Day's notice. (g) If the Lender which is the Administrative Agent shall elect to submit a Competitive Bid in its capacity as a Lender, it shall submit such Competitive Bid directly to the relevant Borrower at least one quarter of an hour earlier than the latest time at which the other Lenders are required to submit their Competitive Bids to the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (b) above. (h) All notices required by this Section 2.3 shall be given in accordance with Section 9.1. (i) No Borrower shall have the right to prepay any Competitive Loan without the consent of the Lender or Lenders making such Competitive Loan. SECTION 2.4. Revolving Credit Borrowing Procedure. In order to request a Revolving Credit Loan, the relevant Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy to the Administrative Agent a Revolving Credit Borrowing Request in the form of Exhibit B-4 (a) in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loan denominated in Dollars, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before a proposed borrowing, (b) in the case of a Multi-Currency Revolving Loan, 8:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before a proposed borrowing and (c) in the case of an ABR Revolving Credit Loan, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed borrowing. Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall in each case specify (i) whether the Revolving Credit Loan then being requested is to be a Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loan or an ABR Revolving Credit Loan, (ii) the date of such Revolving Credit Loan (which shall be a Business Day) and the amount thereof; (iii) in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loan, the Interest Period with respect thereto; and (iv) in the case of a Multi-Currency Revolving Loan, the currency in which such Loan shall be denominated. The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.4 and of each Lender's portion of the requested Loan. SECTION 2.5. Repayment of Loans. Each Borrower shall repay all outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and ABR Swingline Loans made to it, in each case on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date (or such earlier date on which the Commitments shall terminate in accordance herewith). Each Borrower shall repay Quoted Swingline Loans and Competitive
25 Loans made to it, in each case on the Maturity Date applicable thereto. Each Loan shall bear interest from and including the date thereof on the outstanding principal balance thereof as set forth in Section 2.10. SECTION 2.6. Swingline Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Swingline Lender agrees, severally and not jointly, at any time and from time to time on and after the Closing Date and until the earlier of the Business Day immediately preceding the Revolving Credit Maturity Date and the termination of the Swingline Commitment of such Swingline Lender, (i) to make available to any Swingline Borrower Swingline Loans ("Quoted Swingline Loans") on the basis of quoted interest rates (each, a "Quoted Swingline Rate") furnished by such Swingline Lender from time to time in its discretion to such Swingline Borrower (through the Administrative Agent) and accepted by such Swingline Borrower in its discretion and (ii) to make Swingline Loans ("ABR Swingline Loans") to any Swingline Borrower bearing interest at a rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate in an aggregate principal amount (in the case of this clause (ii)) not to exceed such Swingline Lender's Swingline Commitment; provided, that after giving effect to each Swingline Loan, the Total Facility Exposure shall not exceed the Total Commitment then in effect. The aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Quoted Swingline Loans of any Swingline Lender, when added to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the ABR Swingline Loans of such Swingline Lender, may exceed such Swingline Lender's Swingline Commitment; provided, that in no event shall the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Swingline Loans exceed the aggregate Swingline Commitments then in effect. Each Quoted Swingline Loan shall be made only by the Swingline Lender furnishing the relevant Quoted Swingline Rate. Each ABR Swingline Loan shall be made by the Swingline Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Swingline Percentages. The Swingline Loans shall be made in a minimum aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or an aggregate principal amount equal to the remaining balance of the available Swingline Commitments). Each Swingline Lender shall make the portion of each Swingline Loan to be made by it available to any Swingline Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account of such Swingline Borrower with the Administrative Agent or a wire transfer, at the expense of such Swingline Borrower, to an account designated in writing by such Swingline Borrower, in each case by 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the date such Swingline Loan is requested to be made pursuant to paragraph (b) below, in immediately available funds. Each Swingline Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans on or after the Closing Date and prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date (or such earlier date on which the Commitments shall terminate in accordance herewith) on the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth herein. (b) The relevant Swingline Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent telephonic, written or telecopy notice substantially in the form of Exhibit B-5 (in the case of telephonic notice, such notice shall be promptly confirmed by telecopy) no later than 2:30 p.m., New York City time (or, in the case of a proposed Quoted Swingline Loan, 12:00 noon, New York City time), on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Such notice shall be delivered on a Business Day, shall be irrevocable (subject, in the case of Quoted Swingline Loans, to receipt by the relevant Swingline Borrower of Quoted Swingline Rates acceptable to it) and shall refer to this Agreement and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of such Swingline Loan. The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the Swingline Lenders
26 of any notice received from any Swingline Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (b). In the event that a Swingline Borrower accepts a Quoted Swingline Rate in respect of a proposed Quoted Swingline Loan, it shall notify the Administrative Agent (which shall in turn notify the relevant Swingline Lender) of such acceptance no later than 2:30 p.m., New York City time, on the relevant borrowing date. (c) In the event that any ABR Swingline Loan shall be outstanding for more than five Business Days, the Administrative Agent shall, on behalf of the relevant Swingline Borrower (which hereby irrevocably directs and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act on its behalf), request each Lender, including the Swingline Lenders, to make an ABR Revolving Credit Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage of the principal amount of such ABR Swingline Loan. Unless an event described in Article VI, paragraph (f) or (g), has occurred and is continuing, each Lender will make the proceeds of its Revolving Credit Loan available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lenders at the office of the Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, in funds immediately available on the Business Day next succeeding the date such notice is given. The proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans shall be immediately applied to repay the ABR Swingline Loans. (d) A Swingline Lender that has made an ABR Swingline Loan to a Borrower may at any time and for any reason, so long as Revolving Credit Loans have not been made pursuant to Section 2.6(c) to repay such ABR Swingline Loan as required by said Section, by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon New York City time on any Business Day, require the Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of such unrefunded ABR Swingline Loans (the "Unrefunded Swingline Loans"), and each Lender severally, unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that it shall purchase an undivided participating interest in such ABR Swingline Loan in an amount equal to the amount of the Revolving Credit Loan which otherwise would have been made by such Lender pursuant to Section 2.6(c), which purchase shall be funded by the time such Revolving Credit Loan would have been required to be made pursuant to Section 2.6(c). In the event that the Lenders purchase undivided participating interests pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph (d), each Lender shall immediately transfer to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Swingline Lender, in immediately available funds, the amount of its participation. Any Lender holding a participation in an Unrefunded Swingline Loan may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the relevant Swingline Borrower to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan directly to such Swingline Borrower in the amount of such participation. (e) Whenever, at any time after any Swingline Lender has received from any Lender such Lender's participating interest in an ABR Swingline Loan, such Swingline Lender receives any payment on account thereof, such Swingline Lender will promptly distribute to such Lender its participating interest in such amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's participating interest was outstanding and funded); provided, however, that in the event that such payment received by such Swingline Lender is required to be returned, such Lender will return to such Swingline Lender any portion thereof previously distributed by such Swingline Lender to it.
27 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Lender's obligation to make the Revolving Credit Loans referred to in Section 2.6(c) and to purchase and fund participating interests pursuant to Section 2.6(d) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without limitation, (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender or any Swingline Borrower may have against any Swingline Lender, any Swingline Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Article VI, paragraph (f) or (g), in the case of each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to Section 2.6(c)) or the failure to satisfy any of the conditions specified in Article IV; (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of Viacom or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) any breach of this Agreement by any Borrower or any Lender; or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing. (g) Upon written or telecopy notice to the Swingline Lenders and to the Administrative Agent, Viacom may at any time terminate, from time to time in part reduce, or from time to time (with the approval of the relevant Swingline Lender) increase, the Swingline Commitment of any Swingline Lender. At any time when there shall be fewer than ten Swingline Lenders, Viacom may appoint from among the Lenders a new Swingline Lender, subject to the prior consent of such new Swingline Lender and prior notice to the Administrative Agent, so long as at no time shall there be more than ten Swingline Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if any ABR Swingline Loans shall be outstanding at the time of any termination, reduction, increase or appointment pursuant to the preceding two sentences, the Swingline Borrowers shall on the date thereof prepay or borrow ABR Swingline Loans to the extent necessary to ensure that at all times the outstanding ABR Swingline Loans held by the Swingline Lenders shall be pro rata according to the respective Swingline Commitments of the Swingline Lenders and (ii) in no event may the aggregate Swingline Commitments exceed $300,000,000. On the date of any termination or reduction of the Swingline Commitments pursuant to this paragraph (g), the Swingline Borrowers shall pay or prepay so much of the Swingline Loans as shall be necessary in order that, after giving effect to such termination or reduction, (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the ABR Swingline Loans of any Swingline Lender will not exceed the Swingline Commitment of such Swingline Lender and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Swingline Loans will not exceed the aggregate Swingline Commitments. (h) Each Swingline Borrower may prepay any Swingline Loan in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty; provided, that such Swingline Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent written or telecopy notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing or by telecopy) of such prepayment not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day designated by such Swingline Borrower for such prepayment; and provided, further, that each partial payment shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000. Each notice of prepayment under this paragraph (h) shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Swingline Loan (or portion thereof) to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit such Swingline Borrower to prepay such Swingline Loan (or portion thereof) in the amount stated therein on the date stated therein. All prepayments under this paragraph (h) shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the principal amount being prepaid to the date of payment. Each payment of principal of or interest on ABR Swingline
28 Loans shall be allocated, as between the Swingline Lenders, pro rata in accordance with their respective Swingline Percentages. SECTION 2.7. Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Issuing Lender agrees, at any time and from time to time on or after the Closing Date until the earliest to occur of (i) the fifth Business Day preceding the Final Maturity Date, (ii) the first date on which Viacom consummates the Viacom Separation Event and (iii) the termination of the Commitments in accordance with the terms hereof, to issue and deliver or to extend the expiry of Letters of Credit for the account of any Borrower in an aggregate outstanding undrawn amount which does not exceed the maximum amount specified in the applicable Issuing Lender Agreement; provided, that (A) in no event shall the Aggregate LC Exposure exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit at any time and (B) after giving effect to each issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Total Facility Exposure shall not exceed the Total Commitment then in effect. Each Letter of Credit (i) shall be in a form approved in writing by the applicable Borrower and the applicable Issuing Lender and (ii) shall permit drawings upon the presentation of such documents as shall be specified by such Borrower in the applicable notice delivered pursuant to paragraph (c) below. The Lenders agree that, subject to compliance with the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.3, any Designated Letter of Credit may be designated as a Letter of Credit hereunder from time to time on or after the Closing Date pursuant to the procedures specified in the definition of "Designated Letters of Credit". (b) Each Letter of Credit shall by its terms expire not later than the fifth Business Day preceding the Final Maturity Date; provided, however, that in the event that the Revolving Credit Maturity Date occurs prior to the Final Maturity Date, Viacom shall, on or before the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, either (i) deposit cash with the Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Lenders, in an amount equal to the Aggregate LC Exposure in respect of all Letters of Credit outstanding on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, as collateral security for the repayment of any future LC Disbursements under such Letters of Credit, (ii) cause all Letters of Credit outstanding on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date to become "Designated Letters of Credit" (as defined in the Existing $3.0 Billion Five-Year Credit Agreement) under the Existing $3.0 Billion Five-Year Credit Agreement, or (iii) provide to the applicable Issuing Lenders one or more backing letters of credit having an aggregate stated amount equal to the Aggregate LC Exposure in respect of all Letters of Credit outstanding on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, which letters of credit shall be issued by one or more financial institutions acceptable to such Issuing Lenders and shall be in form and substance satisfactory to such Issuing Lenders (it being understood and agreed that the selection as between clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above shall be made by Viacom in its sole discretion). Any Letter of Credit may provide for the renewal thereof for additional periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referred to in the preceding sentence). Each Letter of Credit shall by its terms provide for payment of drawings in Dollars or in a Foreign Currency; provided, that a Letter of Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency may not be issued if, after giving effect thereto, the Dollar equivalent (calculated on the basis of the applicable Foreign Exchange Rate) of the aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit denominated in Foreign Currencies then outstanding would exceed $150,000,000, as determined by the Administrative Agent acting in good faith.
29 (c) The applicable Borrower shall give the applicable Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent written or telecopy notice not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days (or such shorter period as shall be acceptable to such Issuing Lender) prior to any proposed issuance of a Letter of Credit. Each such notice shall refer to this Agreement and shall specify (i) the date on which such Letter of Credit is to be issued (which shall be a Business Day) and the face amount of such Letter of Credit, (ii) the name and address of the beneficiary, (iii) whether such Letter of Credit is a Financial Letter of Credit or a Non-Financial Letter of Credit (subject to confirmation of such status by the Administrative Agent), (iv) whether such Letter of Credit shall permit a single drawing or multiple drawings, (v) the form of the documents required to be presented at the time of any drawing (together with the exact wording of such documents or copies thereof), (vi) the expiry date of such Letter of Credit (which shall conform to the provisions of paragraph (b) above) and (vii) if such Letter of Credit is to be in a Foreign Currency, the relevant Foreign Currency. The Administrative Agent shall give to each Lender prompt written or telecopy advice of the issuance of any Letter of Credit. Each determination by the Administrative Agent as to whether or not a Letter of Credit constitutes a Financial Letter of Credit shall be conclusive and binding upon the applicable Borrower and the Lenders. (d) By the issuance of a Letter of Credit and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Lender or the Lenders in respect thereof, the applicable Issuing Lender hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Lender, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage at the time of any drawing thereunder of the stated amount of such Letter of Credit, effective upon the issuance of such Letter of Credit. In addition, the applicable Issuing Lender hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Lender, a participation in each Designated Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage at the time of any drawing thereunder of the stated amount of such Designated Letter of Credit, effective on the date such Designated Letter of Credit is designated as a Letter of Credit hereunder. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Issuing Lender, in accordance with paragraph (f) below, such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage of each unreimbursed LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Lender; provided, however, that the Lenders shall not be obligated to make any such payment with respect to any payment or disbursement made under any Letter of Credit to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender. (e) Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its acquisition of participations pursuant to paragraph (d) above in respect of Letters of Credit shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without limitation, (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender or the applicable Borrower may have against any Issuing Lender, any Borrower or any other Person, for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the conditions specified in Article IV; (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the applicable Borrower; (iv) any breach of this Agreement by any Borrower or any Lender; or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
30 (f) On the date on which it shall have ascertained that any documents presented under a Letter of Credit appear to be in conformity with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Lender shall give written or telecopy notice to the applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent of the amount of the drawing and the date on which payment thereon has been or will be made. If the applicable Issuing Lender shall not have received from the applicable Borrower the payment required pursuant to paragraph (g) below by 12:00 noon, New York City time, two Business Days after the date on which payment of a draft presented under any Letter of Credit has been made, such Issuing Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn promptly notify each Lender, specifying in the notice to each Lender such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage of such LC Disbursement. Each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on such second Business Day, such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage of such LC Disbursement (which obligation shall be expressed in Dollars only), which the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Lender. The Administrative Agent will promptly remit to each Lender such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage of any amounts subsequently received by the Administrative Agent from the applicable Borrower in respect of such LC Disbursement; provided, that (i) amounts so received for the account of any Lender prior to payment by such Lender of amounts required to be paid by it hereunder in respect of any LC Disbursement and (ii) amounts representing interest at the rate provided in paragraph (g) below on any LC Disbursement for the period prior to the payment by such Lender of such amounts shall in each case be remitted to the applicable Issuing Lender. (g) If an Issuing Lender shall pay any draft presented under a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall pay to such Issuing Lender an amount equal to the amount of such draft before 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the second Business Day immediately following the date of payment of such draft, together with interest (if any) on such amount at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate in effect for ABR Loans (or, in the case of Foreign Currency denominated Letters of Credit, the rate which would reasonably and customarily be charged by such Issuing Lender on outstanding loans denominated in the relevant Foreign Currency) from (and including) the date of payment of such draft to (but excluding) the date on which such Borrower shall have repaid, or the Lenders shall have refunded, such draft in full (which interest shall be payable on such second Business Day and from time to time thereafter on demand until such Borrower shall have repaid, or the Lenders shall have refunded, such draft in full). In the event that such drawing shall be refunded by the Lenders as provided in Section 2.7(f), the applicable Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and December, interest on the amount so refunded at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate in effect for ABR Loans from (and including) the date of such refunding to (but excluding) the date on which the amount so refunded by the Lenders shall have been paid in full in Dollars by such Borrower. Each payment made to an Issuing Lender by the applicable Borrower pursuant to this paragraph shall be made at such Issuing Lender's address for notices specified herein in lawful money of (x) the United States of America (in the case of payments made on Dollar-denominated Letters of Credit) or (y) the applicable foreign jurisdiction (in the case of payments on Foreign Currency-denominated Letters of Credit) and in immediately available funds. The obligation of the applicable Borrower to pay the amounts referred to above in this paragraph (g) (and the obligations of the Lenders under paragraphs (d) and (f) above) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall be satisfied strictly in accordance with their terms irrespective of:
31 (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or any Issuing Lender Agreement or of the obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement or any Issuing Lender Agreement; (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which any Borrower or any other Person may at any time have against the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit, the Agents, any Issuing Lender or any Lender (other than the defense of payment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or a defense based on the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the applicable Issuing Lender) or any other Person in connection with this Agreement or any other transaction; (iii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; provided, that payment by the applicable Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit against presentation of such draft or document shall not have constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct; (iv) payment by the applicable Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document which does not comply in any immaterial respect with the terms of such Letter of Credit; provided, that such payment shall not have constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (v) any other circumstance or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, that such other circumstance or event shall not have been the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct of the applicable Issuing Lender. It is understood that in making any payment under a Letter of Credit (x) such Issuing Lender's exclusive reliance on the documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all matters set forth therein, including reliance on the amount of any draft presented under such Letter of Credit, whether or not the amount due to the beneficiary thereof equals the amount of such draft and whether or not any document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect, if such document on its face appears to be in order, and whether or not any other statement or any other document presented pursuant to such Letter of Credit proves to be forged or invalid or any statement therein proves to be inaccurate or untrue in any respect whatsoever, and (y) any noncompliance in any immaterial respect of the documents presented under a Letter of Credit with the terms thereof shall, in either case, not, in and of itself, be deemed willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Issuing Lender. (h) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, for purposes of calculating any LC Fee payable in respect of any Business Day, the Administrative Agent shall convert the amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency into an amount of Dollars based upon the relevant Foreign Exchange Rate in effect for such day. If on any date the Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable Borrower that, by virtue of any change in the Foreign Exchange Rate of any Foreign Currency in which a Letter of Credit is denominated, the Total Facility Exposure shall exceed the Total Commitment then in effect, then, within three Business Days after the date of such notice,
32 such Borrower shall prepay the Revolving Credit Loans and/or the Swingline Loans to the extent necessary to eliminate such excess. Each Issuing Lender which has issued a Letter of Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency agrees to notify the Administrative Agent of the average daily outstanding amount thereof for any period in respect of which LC Fees are payable and, upon request by the Administrative Agent, for any other date or period. For all purposes of this Agreement (except as otherwise set forth in Section 2.22), determinations by the Administrative Agent of the Dollar equivalent of any amount expressed in a Foreign Currency shall be made on the basis of Foreign Exchange Rates reset monthly (or on such other periodic basis as shall be selected by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) and shall in each case be conclusive absent manifest error. (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.7, prior to demanding any reimbursement from the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.7(f) in respect of any Letter of Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency, the relevant Issuing Lender shall convert the obligation of the applicable Borrower under Section 2.7(g) to reimburse such Issuing Lender in such Foreign Currency into an obligation to reimburse such Issuing Lender (and, in turn, the Lenders) in Dollars. The amount of any such converted obligation shall be computed based upon the relevant Foreign Exchange Rate (as quoted by the Administrative Agent to such Issuing Lender) in effect for the day on which such conversion occurs. SECTION 2.8. Conversion and Continuation Options. (a) The relevant Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loans denominated in Dollars (or, subject to Section 2.10(f), a portion thereof) to ABR Revolving Credit Loans on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto by giving the Administrative Agent prior irrevocable notice of such election. The relevant Borrower may elect from time to time to convert ABR Revolving Credit Loans (subject to Section 2.10(f)) to Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loans denominated in Dollars by giving the Administrative Agent at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election. Any such notice of conversion to Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loans shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period therefor. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. All or any part of outstanding Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loans and ABR Revolving Credit Loans may be converted as provided herein; provided, that no Revolving Credit Loan may be converted into a Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loan when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such a conversion. (b) Any Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loans (or, subject to Section 2.10(f), a portion thereof) may be continued as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the relevant Borrower giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, not less than three Business Days prior to the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Revolving Credit Loans; provided, that no Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loan may be continued as such when any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Required Lenders have determined in its or their sole discretion not to permit such a continuation; and provided, further, that if the relevant Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding proviso such Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loans shall be
33 automatically converted to ABR Revolving Credit Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period (in the case of Multi-Currency Revolving Loans, such Loans shall be converted to Dollars at the Foreign Exchange Rate on such date before being converted to ABR Revolving Credit Loans). Upon receipt of any notice from a Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.8(b), the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Borrower upon the determination in accordance with this Section 2.8(b), by it or the Required Lenders, not to permit such a continuation. SECTION 2.9. Fees. (a) Viacom agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a Facility Fee for the period from and including the Closing Date to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date (or such earlier date on which the Commitments shall terminate in accordance herewith), computed at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Facility Fee Rate on such Lender's Commitment (whether used or unused); provided that, if such Lender continues to have any Facility Exposure after its Commitment terminates, then such Facility Fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such Lender's Facility Exposure from and including the date on which its Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any Facility Exposure. All Facility Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days and shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December (commencing on the first of such dates to occur after the Closing Date), on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date or such earlier date on which the Commitments shall be terminated, and on the date (after termination of the Commitments) on which each Lender ceases to have any Facility Exposure. (b) Viacom agrees to pay each Lender, through the Administrative Agent, on the 15th day of each April, July, October and January and on the Final Maturity Date or the date on which the Commitment of such Lender shall be terminated as provided herein and all Letters of Credit issued hereunder shall have expired, a letter of credit fee (an "LC Fee") computed at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable LC Fee Rate on such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage of the average daily undrawn amount of the Financial Letters of Credit or Non-Financial Letters of Credit, as the case may be, outstanding during the preceding fiscal quarter (or shorter period commencing with the Closing Date or ending with the Final Maturity Date or the date on which the Commitment of such Lender shall have been terminated and all Letters of Credit issued hereunder shall have expired). All LC Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. (c) Viacom agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the administrative agent's fees ("Administrative Agent's Fees") provided for in the Administrative Agent Fee Letter at the times provided therein. (d) Each Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing Lender, through the Administrative Agent, for its own account, the applicable Issuing Lender Fees, including, without limitation, a fronting fee at a rate to be determined by the relevant Borrower and the relevant Issuing Lender with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender payable on the 15th day of each April, July, October and January to such Issuing Lender for the period from and including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to, but not including, the termination date of such Letter of Credit.
34 (e) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate, among the relevant Lenders or to the Issuing Lenders. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances (other than corrections of errors in payment). SECTION 2.10. Interest on Loans; Eurocurrency Tranches; Etc. (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.11, Eurocurrency Loans shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of each Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loan, the Eurocurrency Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Loan plus the Applicable Eurocurrency Margin and (ii) in the case of each Eurocurrency Competitive Loan, the Eurocurrency Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Loan plus or minus (as the case may be) the Margin offered by the Lender making such Loan and accepted by the relevant Borrower pursuant to Section 2.3. The Eurocurrency Rate for each Interest Period shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the relevant Borrower and each Lender of such determination. (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.11, ABR Loans shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, when determined by reference to the Prime Rate and over a year of 360 days at all other times) at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate. The Alternate Base Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (c) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.11, Quoted Swingline Loans shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per annum equal to the relevant Quoted Swingline Rate. (d) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.11, each Absolute Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the fixed rate of interest offered by the Lender making such Loan and accepted by the relevant Borrower pursuant to Section 2.3. (e) Interest on each Loan shall be payable on each applicable Interest Payment Date. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions, continuations, repayments and prepayments of Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder in respect of Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loans shall be in such amounts and shall be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Tranche shall be equal to $50,000,000 (or the Dollar equivalent thereof) or a whole multiple of $5,000,000 (or the Dollar equivalent thereof) in excess thereof. Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, in no event shall there be more than 25 Eurocurrency Tranches outstanding at any time.
35 (g) If no election as to the Type of Revolving Credit Loan is specified in any notice of borrowing with respect thereto, then the requested Loan shall be an ABR Loan, unless such request is for a Revolving Credit Loan denominated in a Multi-Currency. If no Interest Period with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loan is specified in any notice of borrowing, conversion or continuation, then the relevant Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. The Interest Period with respect to a Eurocurrency Competitive Loan shall in no case be less than one month's duration. SECTION 2.11. Default Interest. (a) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Loan shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), all outstanding Loans (whether or not overdue) shall bear interest at a rate per annum which is equal to the rate that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.10 plus 2% and (b) if all or a portion of any LC Disbursement, any interest payable on any Loan or LC Disbursement or any Fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate otherwise applicable to ABR Loans pursuant to Section 2.10(b) plus 2%, in each case, with respect to clauses (a) and (b) above, from the date of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment). SECTION 2.12. Alternate Rate of Interest. In the event, and on each occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Loan (i) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon each Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period, or (ii) the Required Lenders shall have determined and shall have notified the Administrative Agent that the Eurocurrency Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining Eurocurrency Loans during such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, give written or telecopy notice of such determination to the Borrowers and the Lenders. In the event of any such determination, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any request by a Borrower for a Eurocurrency Competitive Loan pursuant to Section 2.3 to be made after such determination shall be of no force and effect and shall be denied by the Administrative Agent, (ii) any request by a Borrower for a Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loan denominated in Dollars pursuant to Section 2.4 to be made after such determination shall be deemed to be a request for an ABR Loan, (iii) any request by a Borrower for a Multi-Currency Revolving Loan to be made after such determination shall be deemed to be a request for an ABR Loan in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar equivalent (as determined by the Foreign Exchange Rate on such date) of the relevant Multi-Currency and (iv) any request by a Borrower for conversion into or a continuation of a Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loan pursuant to Section 2.8 to be made after such determination shall have no force and effect (in the case of a requested conversion) or shall be deemed to be a request for a conversion into an ABR Loan (in the case of a requested continuation); provided, that any request for a conversion of a Multi-Currency Revolving Loan shall be deemed to be a request for a conversion into an ABR Loan in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Dollar equivalent (as determined by the Foreign Exchange Rate on such date) of the relevant Multi-Currency. Also, in the event of any such determination, the relevant
36 Borrower shall be entitled, in its sole discretion, if the requested Competitive Loan has not been made, to cancel its acceptance of the Competitive Bids or to cancel its Competitive Bid Request relating thereto. Each determination by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders hereunder shall be conclusive absent manifest error. SECTION 2.13. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Upon at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable written or telecopy notice to the Administrative Agent, Viacom may at any time in whole permanently terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce, the Commitments; provided, however, that (i) each partial reduction of the Commitments shall be in a minimum principal amount of $10,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (ii) no such termination or reduction shall be made if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the Loans made on the effective date thereof, (x) the Outstanding Revolving Extensions of Credit of any Lender would exceed such Lender's Commitment then in effect or (y) the Total Facility Exposure would exceed the Total Commitment then in effect. The Administrative Agent shall promptly advise the Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this Section 2.13(a). (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.21, each reduction in the Commitments hereunder shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments. Viacom agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, on the date of termination or reduction of the Commitments, the Facility Fees on the amount of the Commitments so terminated or reduced accrued through the date of such termination or reduction. (c) Upon a decrease, pursuant to Section 2.13(a) or (b), in the Commitments, Viacom may decrease the Total Multi-Currency Sublimit and/or the Multi-Currency Sublimit with respect to any or all Multi-Currencies, in each case in a minimum principal amount of $10,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. No such termination or reduction shall be made if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the Loans made on the effective date thereof, (i) the Multi-Currency Sublimit with respect to each applicable Multi-Currency would be less than the Multi-Currency Revolving Loans outstanding in such Multi-Currency at such time or (ii) the Total Multi-Currency Sublimit would be less than the outstanding principal amount of Multi-Currency Revolving Loans at such time. SECTION 2.14. Optional Prepayments of Revolving Credit Loans. The relevant Borrower may at any time and from time to time prepay the Revolving Credit Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon giving irrevocable written or telecopy notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written or telecopy notice) to the Administrative Agent: (i) before 10:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days prior to prepayment, in the case of Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loans, and (ii) before 10:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day prior to prepayment, in the case of ABR Revolving Credit Loans. Such notice shall specify the date and amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loans, ABR Revolving Credit Loans or a combination thereof, and, if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable to each. If a Eurocurrency Revolving Credit Loan is prepaid on any day other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the relevant Borrower shall also pay any amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.16. Upon receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. If any
37 such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with (except in the case of ABR Revolving Credit Loans) accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments of Revolving Credit Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. SECTION 2.15. Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the Closing Date any change in applicable law or regulation (including any change in the reserve percentages provided for in Regulation D) or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender of the principal of or interest on any Eurocurrency Loan or Absolute Rate Loan made by such Lender (other than changes in respect of taxes imposed on the overall net income of such Lender by the jurisdiction in which such Lender has its principal office (or in which it holds any Eurocurrency Loan or Absolute Rate Loan) or by any political subdivision or taxing authority therein and other than taxes that would not have been imposed but for the failure of such Lender to comply with applicable certification, information, documentation or other reporting requirements), or shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of or deposits with or for the account of such Lender, or shall impose on such Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or any Eurocurrency Loan or Absolute Rate Loan made by such Lender, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan or Absolute Rate Loan or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of any Eurocurrency Loan or Absolute Rate Loan by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then the relevant Borrower agrees to pay to such Lender as provided in paragraph (c) below such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Lender shall be entitled to request compensation under this paragraph with respect to any Competitive Loan if the change giving rise to such request shall, or in good faith should, have been taken into account in formulating the Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Competitive Loan shall have been made. (b) If any Lender or any Issuing Lender shall have determined that the adoption after the Closing Date hereof of any law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or administration of any of the foregoing by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or any lending office of such Lender) or Issuing Lender or any Lender's or Issuing Lender's holding company with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Issuing Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or Issuing Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender or the LC Exposure of such Lender or Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender pursuant hereto to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Lender or such Lender's or Issuing Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such applicability, adoption, change or compliance
38 (taking into consideration such Lender's or Issuing Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's or Issuing Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender or Issuing Lender to be material, then from time to time the relevant Borrower agrees to pay to such Lender or Issuing Lender as provided in paragraph (c) below such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender or such Lender's or Issuing Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) A certificate of each Lender or Issuing Lender setting forth such amount or amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be, and the basis therefor in reasonable detail shall be delivered to the relevant Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The relevant Borrower shall pay each Lender or Issuing Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after its receipt of the same. Upon the receipt of any such certificate, the relevant Borrower shall be entitled, in its sole discretion, if any requested Loan has not been made, to cancel its acceptance of the relevant Competitive Bids or to cancel the Competitive Bid Request relating thereto, subject to Section 2.16. (d) Except as provided in this paragraph, failure on the part of any Lender or Issuing Lender to demand compensation for any increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or Issuing Lender's right to demand compensation with respect to any other period. The protection of this Section 2.15 shall be available to each Lender and Issuing Lender regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or other change or condition which shall have occurred or been imposed so long as it shall be customary for Lenders or Issuing Lenders affected thereby to comply therewith. No Lender or Issuing Lender shall be entitled to compensation under this Section 2.15 for any costs incurred or reductions suffered with respect to any date unless it shall have notified the relevant Borrower that it will demand compensation for such costs or reductions under paragraph (c) above not more than 90 days after the later of (i) such date and (ii) the date on which it shall have become aware of such costs or reductions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.15, no Lender or Issuing Lender shall demand compensation for any increased cost or reduction referred to above if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such Lender or Issuing Lender (as the case may be) to demand such compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements, if any. In the event any Borrower shall reimburse any Lender or Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any cost and such Lender or Issuing Lender (as the case may be) shall subsequently receive a refund in respect thereof, such Lender or Issuing Lender (as the case may be) shall so notify such Borrower and, upon its request, will pay to such Borrower the portion of such refund which such Lender or Issuing Lender (as the case may be) shall determine in good faith to be allocable to the cost so reimbursed. The covenants contained in this Section 2.15 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. SECTION 2.16. Indemnity. Each Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender against any loss or expense described below which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) any failure by such Borrower to fulfill on the date of any borrowing hereunder the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV, (b) any failure by such Borrower to
39 borrow, continue or convert any Loan hereunder after irrevocable notice of such borrowing, continuation or conversion has been given or deemed given or Competitive Bids have been accepted pursuant to Article II, (c) any payment, prepayment or conversion of a Eurocurrency Loan or Absolute Rate Loan made to such Borrower required by any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise made or deemed made, whatever the circumstances may be that give rise to such payment, prepayment or conversion, or any transfer of any such Loan pursuant to Section 2.21 or 9.4(b), on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or (d) if any breakage is incurred, any failure by a Borrower to prepay a Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in a notice of prepayment; provided, that any request for indemnification made by any Lender to any Borrower pursuant hereto shall be accompanied by such Lender's calculation of such amount to be indemnified. The loss or expense for which such Lender shall be indemnified under this Section 2.16 shall be equal to the excess, if any, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its cost of obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid, converted or not borrowed, continued, prepaid or converted (assumed to be the Eurocurrency Rate in the case of Eurocurrency Loans) for the period from the date of such payment, prepayment, conversion or failure to borrow, continue, prepay or convert to the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, continue, prepay or convert, the Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date of such failure) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would be realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds so paid, prepaid, converted or not borrowed, continued, prepaid or converted for such period or Interest Period, as the case may be; provided, however, that such amount shall not include any loss of a Lender's margin or spread over its cost of obtaining funds as described above. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts which such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16 (with calculations in reasonable detail) shall be delivered to the relevant Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. SECTION 2.17. Pro Rata Treatment; Funding Matters; Evidence of Debt. (a) Except as required under Section 2.21, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Revolving Credit Loan, each payment of interest on the Revolving Credit Loans, each payment of LC Fees, each payment of the Facility Fees, and each reduction of the Commitments, shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments (or, if such Commitments shall have expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Revolving Credit Loans). Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender's portion of any Loan to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round such Lender's percentage of such Loan to the next higher or lower whole Dollar amount. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the relevant borrowing date that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of a borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such borrowing in accordance with this Agreement and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available to the Administrative Agent, each of such Lender and the relevant Borrower agrees to
40 repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the relevant Loan and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan as part of such borrowing for the purposes of this Agreement; provided, that such repayment shall not release such Lender from any liability it may have to such Borrower for the failure to make such Loan at the time required herein. (c) The failure of any Lender to make any Loan shall not in itself relieve any other Lender of its obligation to lend hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender). (d) Each Lender may at its option make any Eurocurrency Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Lender Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided, that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the relevant Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (e) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by it from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Borrower with respect to each Loan, the Type of each Loan and each Interest Period, if any, applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from any Borrower and each Lender's share thereof. The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to this paragraph (e) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligations of any Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with their terms. (f) In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Subsidiary Borrower shall be deemed, by its execution and delivery of a Subsidiary Borrower Request, to have appointed Viacom to act as agent on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower for the purpose of (i) giving any notices contemplated to be given by such Subsidiary Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, borrowing notices, prepayment notices, continuation notices, conversion notices, competitive bid requests and competitive bid acceptances or rejections and (ii) paying on behalf of such Subsidiary Borrower any Subsidiary Borrower Obligations owing by such Subsidiary Borrower; provided, that each Subsidiary Borrower shall retain the right, in its discretion, to directly give any or all of such notices or make any or all of such payments.
41 (g) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders upon receipt of any Subsidiary Borrower Designation and Subsidiary Borrower Request. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Swingline Lenders upon receipt of any designation of a Subsidiary Borrower as a Swingline Borrower. SECTION 2.18. Sharing of Setoffs. Except to the extent that this Agreement provides for payments to be allocated to Revolving Credit Loans, Swingline Loans or Competitive Loans, as the case may be, each Lender agrees that if it shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim against any Borrower, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means (other than pursuant to any provision of this Agreement), obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of any category of its Loans or such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage of any LC Disbursement as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of such Loans or the unpaid portion of such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage of the LC Disbursements shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of such Loans or the unpaid portion of the Revolving Credit Percentage of the LC Disbursements of any other Lender, it shall be deemed simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender at face value, and shall promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase price for, a participation in such Loans or the Revolving Credit Percentage of the LC Disbursements of such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans and participations in such Loans held by each Lender or the Revolving Credit Percentage of LC Disbursements and participations in LC Disbursements held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all such Loans or LC Disbursements then outstanding as the principal amount of such Loans or the Revolving Credit Percentage of LC Disbursements of each Lender prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event was to the principal amount of all such Loans or LC Disbursements outstanding prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event; provided, however, that, if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.18 and the payment giving rise thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without interest, unless the Lender from which such payment is recovered is required to pay interest thereon, in which case each Lender returning funds to such Lender shall pay its pro rata share of such interest. Any Lender holding a participation in a Loan or LC Disbursement deemed to have been so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by any Borrower to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender had made a Loan directly to such Borrower or issued a Letter of Credit for the account of such Borrower in the amount of such participation. SECTION 2.19. Payments. (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each Borrower shall make each payment (including principal of or interest on any Loan or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder without setoff or counterclaim and shall make each such payment not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due in Dollars to the Administrative Agent at its offices at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017, in immediately available funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Borrower shall make each payment with respect to any Loan denominated in any Foreign
42 Currency (including principal of or interest on any such Loan or other amounts) hereunder without setoff or counterclaim and shall make each such payment not later than 12:00 noon, London time, on the date when due in the relevant Foreign Currency to the Administrative Agent at its offices at J.P. Morgan Europe Limited, 125 London Wall, London, England EC2Y 5AJ, United Kingdom, in immediately available funds. (b) Whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any Loan or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable. SECTION 2.20. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by each Borrower hereunder shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.19, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto imposed by or on behalf of any Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection between the Administrative Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent's or such Lender's having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this Agreement or any other Loan Document) (all such nonexcluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable to any Agent or any Lender hereunder, (i) the sum payable shall be increased by the amount necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.20) such Agent or such Lender shall receive an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxing authority or other Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (b) The relevant Borrower agrees to pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) The relevant Borrower will indemnify each Lender (or Transferee) and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by the applicable jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.20) paid by such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted by the relevant taxing authority or other Governmental Authority. Such indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, makes written demand therefor.
43 (d) Whenever any Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by any Borrower, within 30 days thereafter such Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an official receipt received by such Borrower showing payment thereof (or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent). (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement contained herein, the agreements and obligations contained in this Section 2.20 shall survive the payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Loans made hereunder and of all other amounts payable hereunder. (f) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a "United States Person" as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (such Lender (or Transferee), a "Non-U.S. Person") shall deliver to Viacom and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Person claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto (and, if such Non-U.S. Person, claiming an exemption with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", delivers a Form W-8BEN, an annual certificate representing that such Non-U.S. Person is not a "bank" for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of Viacom and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to Viacom (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code)), properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Person claiming complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by any Borrower under this Agreement. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Person promptly after it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any participant, promptly after the date such participant purchases the related participation). In addition, each Non-U.S. Person shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Person. Each Non-U.S. Person shall promptly notify Viacom at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to Viacom (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Unless Viacom and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a participant, the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased) have received forms or other documents satisfactory to them indicating that payments hereunder are not subject to United States withholding tax, the relevant Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable statutory rate in the case of payments of interest to or for any Lender (or Transferee) that is a Non-U.S. Person. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.20(f), a Non-U.S. Person shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section 2.20(f) that such Non-U.S. Person is not legally able to deliver by reason of the adoption of any law, rule or regulation, or any change in any law, rule or regulation or in the interpretation thereof, in each case occurring after the date such Non-U.S. Person becomes a Lender (or Transferee). (g) A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower is located, or under any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement
44 shall deliver to such Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate, provided that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender. (h) No Borrower shall be required to pay any additional amounts to any Agent or Lender pursuant to paragraph (a) above (i) if the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Agent or Lender to comply with the provisions of paragraph (f) or (g) above or (ii) in the case of a Transferee, to the extent such additional amounts exceed the additional amounts that would have been payable had no transfer or assignment to such Transferee occurred; provided, however, that each Borrower shall be required to pay those amounts to any Agent or Lender (or Transferee) that it was required to pay hereunder prior to the failure of such Agent or Lender (or Transferee) to comply with the provisions of such paragraph (f) or (g). SECTION 2.21. Termination or Assignment of Commitments Under Certain Circumstances. (a) Any Lender (or Transferee) claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or Section 2.20 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or document requested by any Borrower or to change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a filing or change would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such additional amounts which may thereafter accrue and would not, in the sole determination of such Lender (or Transferee), be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender (or Transferee). (b) In the event that (x) any Lender shall have delivered a notice or certificate pursuant to Section 2.15, (y) any Borrower shall be required to make additional payments to any Lender under Section 2.20, or (z) any Lender (a "Non-Consenting Lender") shall withhold its consent to any amendment described in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 9.8(b) as to which consents have been obtained from Lenders having Total Facility Percentages aggregating at least 90%, Viacom shall have the right, at its own expense, upon notice to such Lender (or Lenders) and the Administrative Agent, (i) to terminate the Commitments of such Lender (except in the case of clause (z) above) or (ii) to require such Lender (or, in the case of clause (z) above, each Non-Consenting Lender) to transfer and assign without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.4) all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more other financial institutions acceptable to Viacom (unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) and the Administrative Agent, which approval in each case shall not be unreasonably withheld, which shall assume such obligations; provided, that (w) in the case of any replacement of Non-Consenting Lenders, each assignee shall have consented to the relevant amendment, (x) no such termination or assignment shall conflict with any law, rule or regulation or order of any Governmental Authority, (y) the Borrowers or the assignee (or assignees), as the case may be, shall pay to each affected Lender in immediately available funds on the date of such termination or assignment the principal of and interest accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made by it hereunder and all other amounts accrued for its account or
45 owed to it hereunder and (z) Viacom may not terminate Commitments representing more than 10% of the original aggregate Commitments pursuant to this paragraph (b). SECTION 2.22. Currency Equivalents. (a) The Administrative Agent shall determine the Dollar equivalent of each Competitive Bid Loan in a Foreign Currency and each Multi-Currency Revolving Loan as of the first day of each Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the case of any such Interest Period of more than three months, at three-month intervals after the first day thereof. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Borrowers and the Lenders of the Dollar equivalent so determined by it. Each such determination shall be based on the Spot Rate (i) (A) on the date of the related Competitive Bid Request, for purposes of the initial determination of such Competitive Bid Loan, and (B) on the date of the related Revolving Credit Borrowing Request, for purposes of the initial determination of such Multi-Currency Revolving Loan, and (ii) on the fourth Business Day prior to the date on which such Dollar equivalent is to be determined, for purposes of subsequent determinations. (b) The Administrative Agent shall determine the Dollar equivalent of the Aggregate LC Exposure related to each Letter of Credit issued in a Foreign Currency as of the date of the issuance thereof, at three-month intervals after the date of issuance thereof and as of the date of each drawing thereunder. Each such determination shall be based on the Spot Rate (i) on the date of the related notice of any proposed issuance of a Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.7(c), in the case of the initial determination of such Letter of Credit, (ii) on the second Business Day prior to the date as of which such Dollar equivalent is to be determined, in the case of any subsequent determination with respect to an outstanding Letter of Credit and (iii) on the second Business Day prior to the related drawing thereunder, in the case of any determination as to a drawing thereunder. (c) If after giving effect to any such determination of a Dollar equivalent with respect to Competitive Bid Loans or Letters of Credit, the Dollar equivalent thereof exceeds $150,000,000, Viacom shall, or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary Borrowers to, within five Business Days, (i) in the case of an excess with respect to Competitive Bid Loans, prepay outstanding Competitive Bid Loans in Foreign Currencies to eliminate such excess, (ii) in the case of an excess with respect to Letters of Credit, cause to be reduced (or, at the relevant Borrower's option, cash collateralize) outstanding Letters of Credit in Foreign Currencies to eliminate such excess, or (iii) in each case, take such other action to the extent necessary to eliminate any such excess. If after giving effect to any such determination of a Dollar equivalent with respect to Multi-Currency Revolving Loans, the Dollar equivalent thereof exceeds (A) the Multi-Currency Sublimit for any currency or (B) the Total Multi-Currency Sublimit, Viacom shall, or shall cause the relevant Subsidiary Borrowers to, within five Business Days, prepay outstanding Multi-Currency Revolving Loans so that the Specified Currency Availability for each currency is greater than or equal to zero and so that the Total Specified Currency Availability is greater than or equal to zero or take such other action to the extent necessary to eliminate any such excess. (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time (i) the Commitment Utilization Percentage is greater than 110%, Viacom shall, or shall cause the relevant Subsidiary Borrowers to, within five Business Days prepay outstanding Competitive Bid Loans in Foreign Currencies, prepay outstanding Multi-Currency Revolving Loans, cause to be reduced (or, at the
46 relevant Borrower's option, cash collateralize) outstanding Letters of Credit in Foreign Currencies or take such other action to the extent necessary to eliminate any such excess, or (ii) the Dollar equivalent of the outstanding Multi-Currency Revolving Loans is greater than 110% of (A) the Multi-Currency Sublimit for any currency or (B) the Total Multi-Currency Sublimit, Viacom shall, or shall cause the relevant Subsidiary Borrowers to, within five Business Days, prepay outstanding Multi-Currency Revolving Loans so that the Specified Currency Availability for each currency is greater than or equal to zero and so that the Total Specified Currency Availability is greater than or equal to zero or take such other action to the extent necessary to eliminate any such excess. (e) If any prepayment of a Competitive Bid Loan or a Multi-Currency Revolving Loan occurs pursuant to this Section 2.22 on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, Viacom shall, or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary Borrowers to, pay to the Lenders such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.16. SECTION 2.23. Judgment Currency. If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due from any Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the "specified currency") into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agent's London office on any Business Day preceding that on which the final judgment is given. The obligations of each Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the applicable Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (i) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (ii) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender as compared to such Lender's Total Facility Percentage, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the applicable Borrower. ARTICLE III REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES Viacom hereby represents and warrants, and each Subsidiary Borrower by its execution and delivery of a Subsidiary Borrower Request represents and warrants (to the extent specifically applicable to such Subsidiary Borrower), to each of the Lenders that:
47 SECTION 3.1. Corporate Existence. Each of Viacom and each Material Subsidiary: (a) is a corporation, partnership or other entity duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization; (b) has all requisite corporate or other power, and has all material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals, necessary to own its assets and carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to have any of the foregoing would not result in a Material Adverse Effect; and (c) is qualified to do business in all jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary and where failure so to qualify would result in a Material Adverse Effect. SECTION 3.2. Financial Condition. The consolidated balance sheet of Viacom and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income and cash flows of Viacom and its Consolidated Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended on such date, with the opinion thereon of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, heretofore furnished to each of the Lenders, fairly present the consolidated financial condition of Viacom and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date and the consolidated results of their operations for the fiscal year ended on such date in accordance with GAAP. Neither Viacom nor any of its Material Subsidiaries had on such date any known material contingent liability, except as referred to or reflected or provided for in the Exchange Act Report or in such balance sheets (or the notes thereto) as at such date. SECTION 3.3. Litigation. Except as disclosed to the Lenders in the Exchange Act Report filed prior to the Closing Date or otherwise disclosed in writing to the Lenders prior to the Closing Date, there are no legal or arbitral proceedings, or any proceedings by or before any Governmental Authority, pending or (to the knowledge of Viacom) threatened against Viacom or any of its Material Subsidiaries which have resulted in a Material Adverse Effect (it being agreed that any legal or arbitral proceedings which have been disclosed in the Exchange Act Report, whether threatened, pending, resulting in a judgment or otherwise, prior to the time a final judgment for the payment of money shall have been recorded against Viacom or any Material Subsidiary by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction, and the judgment is non-appealable (or the time for appeal has expired) and all stays of execution have expired or been lifted shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to result in a Material Adverse Effect). The "Exchange Act Report" shall mean, collectively, the Annual Report of Viacom on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Reports on Form 8-K of Viacom filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to December 31, 2004, but on or before April 20, 2005, in each case, as amended or supplemented on or before April 20, 2005. SECTION 3.4. No Breach, etc. None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated and compliance with the terms and provisions hereof will conflict with or result in a breach of, or require any consent under, the charter or By-laws (or other equivalent organizational documents) of any Borrower, or any applicable law or regulation, or any order, writ, injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority, or any material agreement or instrument to which Viacom or any of its Material Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound or to which any of them is subject, or constitute a default under any such agreement or instrument, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the revenues or assets of Viacom or any of its Material Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any such agreement or instrument. Neither Viacom nor any
48 of its Material Subsidiaries is in default under or with respect to any of its material contractual obligations in any respect which would have a Material Adverse Effect. SECTION 3.5. Corporate Action. Each Borrower has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement; the execution and delivery by each Borrower of this Agreement (or, in the case of each Subsidiary Borrower, the relevant Subsidiary Borrower Request), and the performance by each Borrower of this Agreement, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on such Borrower's part; this Agreement (or, in the case of each Subsidiary Borrower, the relevant Subsidiary Borrower Request) has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each Borrower; and this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its terms except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or similar laws of general applicability affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and (b) the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). SECTION 3.6. Approvals. No authorizations, approvals or consents of, and no filings or registrations with, any Governmental Authority are necessary for the execution, delivery or performance by each Borrower of this Agreement or for the validity or enforceability hereof. SECTION 3.7. ERISA. Viacom and, to the best of its knowledge, its ERISA Affiliates have fulfilled their respective obligations under the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan and are in compliance in all material respects with the currently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code except where any failure or non-compliance would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. SECTION 3.8. Taxes. Viacom and its Material Subsidiaries, to the knowledge of Viacom, have filed all United States Federal income tax returns and all other material tax returns which are required to be filed by or in respect of them and have paid or caused to be paid all taxes shown as due on such returns or pursuant to any assessment received by Viacom or any of its Material Subsidiaries, except those being contested and reserved against in accordance with Section 5.2.

After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.5 shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent. With respect to the Loans made by them and their LC Exposure hereunder, the Agents in their individual capacity and not as Agents shall have the same rights and powers as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though they were not Agents, and the Agents and their affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrowers or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any Affiliate thereof as if they were not Agents. Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees (i) to reimburse the Administrative Agent in the amount of its pro rata share (based on its Total Facility Percentage or, after the date on which the Loans shall have been paid in full, based on its Total Facility Percentage immediately prior to such date) of any reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses incurred for the benefit of the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders by the Administrative Agent, including reasonable counsel fees and compensation of agents and employees paid for services rendered on behalf of the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders, which shall not have been reimbursed by or on behalf of any Borrower and (ii) to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and any of its directors, officers, employees or agents, in the amount of such pro rata share, from and against any and all liabilities, taxes, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against it in its capacity as Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by it under this Agreement, to the extent the same shall not have been reimbursed by or on behalf of Viacom; provided, that no Lender or Issuing Lender shall be liable to the Administrative Agent or any such director, officer, employee or agent for any portion of such liabilities, taxes, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents.
61 Each Lender and Issuing Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Lender or Issuing Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender and Issuing Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender or Issuing Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Neither the Co-Documentation Agents, the Syndication Agent, the Joint Lead Arrangers nor any managing agent shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in its capacity as such.

No payment or payments made by any Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person or received or collected by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from any Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any setoff or appropriation or application, at any time or from time to time, in reduction of or in payment of the Subsidiary Borrower Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability of Viacom under this Section 8.1 which, notwithstanding any such payment or payments, shall remain liable for the unpaid and outstanding Subsidiary Borrower Obligations until, subject to Section 8.1(e), the Subsidiary Borrower Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments are terminated.

So long as the Subsidiary Borrower Obligations remain outstanding, if any amount shall be paid by or on behalf of any Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person to Viacom on account of any of the rights waived in this Section 8.1, such amount shall be held by Viacom in trust, segregated from other funds of Viacom, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by Viacom, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by Viacom (duly indorsed by Viacom to the Administrative Agent, if required), to be applied against the Subsidiary Borrower Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Administrative Agent may determine. (c) Amendments, etc. with respect to the Subsidiary Borrower Obligations. Viacom shall remain obligated under this Section 8.1 notwithstanding that, without any reservation of rights against Viacom, and without notice to or further assent by Viacom, any demand for payment of or reduction in the principal amount of any of the Subsidiary Borrower Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and any of the Subsidiary Borrower Obligations continued, and the Subsidiary Borrower Obligations, or the liability of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, and this Agreement and any other documents executed and delivered in connection herewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, as the Required Lenders (or all Lenders, as the case may be) may deem advisable from time to time, and any collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Subsidiary Borrower Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released.

(d) Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Viacom waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Subsidiary Borrower Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the guarantee contained in this Section 8.1 or acceptance of the guarantee contained in this Section 8.1; the Subsidiary Borrower Obligations shall conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon the guarantee contained in this Section 8.1; and all dealings between Viacom or the Subsidiary Borrowers, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon the

When the Administrative Agent or any Lender is pursuing its rights and remedies under this Section 8.1 against Viacom, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against any Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person or against any collateral security or guarantee for the Subsidiary Borrower Obligations or any right of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from any Subsidiary Borrower or any such other Person or to realize upon any such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset, or any release of any Subsidiary Borrower or any such other Person or of any such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve Viacom of any liability under this Section 8.1, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders against Viacom.

70 (f) Each Lender may without the consent of any Borrower, the Agents or any Issuing Lender sell participations to one or more banks, other financial institutions or other entities (provided, that any such other entity is a not a competitor of Viacom or any Affiliate of Viacom) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the participating banks, financial institutions or other entities shall be entitled to the benefit of the cost protection provisions contained in Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.20 to the same extent as if they were Lenders (provided, that additional amounts payable to any Lender pursuant to Section 2.20 shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold any such participations) and (iv) the Borrowers, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the obligations of each Borrower relating to the Loans and the Letters of Credit and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement (other than amendments, modifications or waivers decreasing any fees payable hereunder or the amount of principal of or the rate at which interest is payable on the Loans or LC Disbursements, extending any scheduled principal payment date or date fixed for the payment of interest on the Loans or LC Disbursements or of LC Fees or Facility Fees, increasing the amount of or extending the Commitments or releasing the guarantee contained in Section 8.1 or 8.2 (except in accordance with Section 8.2(g)), in each case to the extent the relevant participant is directly affected thereby). (g) Any Lender or participant may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 9.4, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant any information relating to any Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of such Borrower; provided, that, prior to any such disclosure of information designated by such Borrower as confidential, each such assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall execute a Confidentiality Agreement whereby such assignee or participant shall agree (subject to the exceptions set forth therein) to preserve the confidentiality of such confidential information. A copy of each such Confidentiality Agreement executed by an assignee shall be promptly furnished to Viacom. It is understood that confidential information relating to the Borrowers would not ordinarily be provided in connection with assignments or participations of Competitive Loans. (h) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in paragraph (b) above, (i) any Lender may at any time assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank and (ii) any Lender which is a "fund" may at any time assign or pledge all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure such Lender's indebtedness, in each case without the prior written consent of any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Lender; provided, that each such assignment shall be made in accordance with applicable law and no such assignment shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder. In order to facilitate any such assignment, each Borrower shall, at the request of the assigning Lender, duly execute and deliver to the assigning Lender a registered promissory note or notes evidencing the Loans made to such Borrower by the assigning Lender hereunder.
71 (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "Granting Bank") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an "SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Bank to the Administrative Agent and the relevant Borrower, the option to provide to such Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Bank would otherwise be obligated to make to such Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Bank shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Bank to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Bank. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Bank). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the relevant Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lenders and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting Bank or to any financial institutions (consented to by such Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lender) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This section may not be amended without the written consent of any SPC which has been identified as such by the Granting Bank to the Administrative Agent and the relevant Borrower and which then holds any Loan pursuant to this paragraph (i). (j) Neither Viacom nor any Subsidiary Borrower shall assign or delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder without the prior consent of all the Lenders; provided, Viacom may assign or delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder (excepting its rights and duties pursuant to Section 8.1) to any Subsidiary Borrower and any Subsidiary Borrower may assign or delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder to Viacom or (excepting Viacom International's rights and duties pursuant to 8.2) to any other Subsidiary Borrower, in each case without the prior consent of the Lenders unless such assignment would adversely affect the Lenders; provided, further, Viacom may and any Subsidiary Borrower may assign or delegate any of its rights and duties hereunder pursuant to a merger or consolidation permitted by Section 5.4(a) or (c) without the prior consent of the Lenders. SECTION 9.5. Expenses; Indemnity. (a) Viacom agrees to pay all reasonable legal and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., in its capacity as a Joint Lead Arranger and in its capacity as Sole Bookrunner, and by the Administrative Agent and their respective affiliates in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement or in connection with any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not the transactions hereby contemplated shall be
72 consummated) or incurred by any Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Lender in connection with the enforcement or protection of the rights of the Agents, the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders under this Agreement or in connection with the Loans made or the Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP, counsel for J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., in its capacity as a Joint Lead Arranger and in its capacity as Sole Bookrunner, and the Administrative Agent, and, in connection with any such enforcement or protection, the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any other counsel for any Agent, Lender or Issuing Lender. (b) Viacom agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Agent, each Lender, each Issuing Lender and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents (each, an "Indemnified Person") against, and to reimburse each Indemnified Person, upon its demand, for, any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or other expenses ("Losses"), to which such Indemnified Person becomes subject insofar as such Losses arise out of or in any way relate to or result from (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby (and any amendment hereto or thereto), the performance by the parties hereto or thereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or (ii) the use (or proposed use) of the proceeds of the Loans or other extensions of credit hereunder, including, without limitation, Losses consisting of reasonable legal, settlement or other expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending or participating in any legal proceeding relating to any of the foregoing (whether or not such Indemnified Person is a party thereto); provided, that the foregoing will not apply to any Losses to which an Indemnified Person becomes subject to the extent they are found by a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person. No Indemnified Person shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained through electronic, telecommunications or other information transmission systems (provided, that the foregoing will not apply to any Losses to the extent they are found by a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person). (c) The provisions of this Section 9.5 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of any Agent or Lender. All amounts under this Section 9.5 shall be payable on written demand therefor. SECTION 9.6. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Agent and each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Agent or Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower against any of and all the obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or the Administrative Agent Fee Letter held by such Agent or Lender which shall be due and payable. The rights of each Agent and each Lender under this Section 9.6 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Agent or Lender may have.
73 SECTION 9.7. APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. SECTION 9.8. Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay of any Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Borrower from any such provision shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice or demand on any Borrower in any case shall entitle any Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement in writing entered into by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such agreement shall (i) reduce the amount or extend the scheduled date of maturity of any Loan or of any installment thereof, or reduce the stated amount of any LC Disbursement, interest or fee payable hereunder or extend the scheduled date of any payment thereof or increase the amount or extend the expiration date of any Commitment of any Lender, in each case without the prior written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; (ii) amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section 9.8(b), or reduce the percentage specified in the definition of "Required Lenders", release the guarantee contained in Section 8.1 or 8.2 (except in accordance with Section 8.2(g)) or consent to the assignment or delegation by Viacom or any Subsidiary Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (except (A) by Viacom (excepting its rights and duties pursuant to Section 8.1) to any Subsidiary Borrower or (B) by any Subsidiary Borrower to Viacom or (excepting Viacom International's rights and duties pursuant to Section 8.2) to any other Subsidiary Borrower and as set forth in Section 9.4(j)), in each case without the prior written consent of all the Lenders; (iii) amend, modify or waive Section 2.17(a) in a manner that would alter the pro rata allocation of payments required thereby without the prior written consent of all the Lenders; or (iv) amend, modify or waive any provision of Article VII without the prior written consent of each Agent affected thereby; provided, further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lenders or the Issuing Lenders hereunder in such capacity without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, each Swingline Lender directly affected thereby or each Issuing Lender directly affected thereby, as the case may be. SECTION 9.9. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Issuing Lender Agreements, the Subsidiary Borrower Designations and the Subsidiary Borrower Requests) constitutes the entire contract between the parties relative to the subject matter hereof. Any previous agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof is superseded by this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to
74 confer upon any party other than the parties hereto any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. SECTION 9.10. Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.10. SECTION 9.11. Severability. In the event any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions. SECTION 9.12. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall constitute but one contract, and shall become effective as provided in Section 9.3. SECTION 9.13. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement. SECTION 9.14. Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its Property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each Subsidiary Borrower designates and directs Viacom at its offices at 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, as its agent to receive service of any and all process and documents on its behalf in any legal action or proceeding referred to in this Section 9.14 in the State of New York and agrees that service upon such agent shall constitute valid and effective service upon such Subsidiary Borrower and that failure of Viacom to give any notice of such service to any Subsidiary Borrower shall not affect or impair in any way the validity of such service or of any judgment rendered in any action or proceeding based thereon. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any
75 action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against any Borrower or its Properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. (b) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any New York State or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. (c) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.1. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. SECTION 9.15. Confidentiality. (a) Each Lender agrees to keep confidential and not to disclose (and to cause its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives to keep confidential and not to disclose) and, at the request of Viacom (except as provided below or if such Lender is required to retain any Confidential Information (as defined below) pursuant to customary internal or banking practices, bank regulations or applicable law), promptly to return to Viacom or destroy the Confidential Information and all copies thereof, extracts therefrom and analyses or other materials based thereon, except that such Lender shall be permitted to disclose Confidential Information (i) to such of its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates and representatives as need to know such Confidential Information in connection with such Lender's participation in this Agreement, each of whom shall be informed by such Lender of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and shall agree to be bound by the terms of this Section 9.15; (ii) to the extent required by applicable laws and regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process or requested by any Governmental Authority or agency having jurisdiction over such Lender; provided, however, that, except in the case of disclosure to bank regulators or examiners in accordance with customary banking practices, if legally permitted written notice of each instance in which Confidential Information is required or requested to be disclosed shall be furnished to Viacom not less than 30 days prior to the expected date of such disclosure or, if 30 days' notice is not practicable under the circumstances, as promptly as practicable under the circumstances; (iii) to the extent such Confidential Information (A) is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement, (B) becomes available to such Lender on a non-confidential basis from a source other than a party to this Agreement or any other party known to such Lender to be bound by an agreement containing a provision similar to this Section 9.15 or (C) was available to such Lender on a non-confidential basis prior to this disclosure to such Lender by a party to this Agreement or any other party known to such Lender to be bound by an agreement containing a provision similar to this Section 9.15; (iv) as permitted by Section 9.4(g); or (v) to the extent Viacom shall have consented to such disclosure in writing. As used in this Section 9.15, "Confidential Information" shall mean any materials, documents or information furnished by or on behalf of any Borrower in connection with this Agreement designated by or on behalf of such Borrower as confidential. (b) Each Lender (i) agrees that, except to the extent the conditions referred to in subclause (A), (B) or (C) of clause (iii) of paragraph (a) above have been met and as provided
76 in paragraph (c) below, (A) it will use the Confidential Information only in connection with its participation in this Agreement and (B) it will not use the Confidential Information in connection with any other matter or in a manner prohibited by any law, including, without limitation, the securities laws of the United States and (ii) understands that breach of this Section 9.15 might seriously prejudice the interest of the Borrowers and that the Borrowers are entitled to equitable relief, including an injunction, in the event of such breach. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.15, each Agent and each Lender shall be entitled to retain all Confidential Information for so long as it remains an Agent or a Lender to use solely for the purposes of servicing the credit and protecting its rights hereunder. SECTION 9.16. Consent to Amendments to Existing Credit Agreements. By its execution of this Agreement, each Lender hereby consents to and approves (a) Amendment No. 4 to the Existing $1.5 Billion Five-Year Credit Agreement, the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit G, and (b) Amendment No. 1 to the Existing $3.0 Billion Five-Year Credit Agreement, the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit H, and hereby authorizes JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its capacity as Administrative Agent under each of the Existing Credit Agreements, to execute such Amendment No. 4 and such Amendment No. 1 on behalf of such Lender.
