Exhibit 99
 
 
 
 
New York, New York, November 1, 2005  Viacom Inc. (NYSE: VIA and VIA.B) today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2005.
 
Revenues increased 10% to $5.9 billion from $5.4 billion for the same quarter last year, led by growth of 15% in Cable Networks and 54% in Entertainment, as well as increases in Outdoor and Radio.  Viacom's revenues from advertising climbed 9% led by gains of 17% at Cable Networks and 7% at Television.  Operating income rose 5% to $1.4 billion, paced by increases at Cable Networks, Radio, Outdoor, Entertainment and Parks/Publishing.
 
Third quarter results included several non-recurring items which reduced operating income by approximately $58 million.  The Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $19 million related to the sale of two TV stations.  Also, damage from hurricanes Katrina and Rita cost the Company $7 million in revenues and $15 million in expenses, principally in Outdoor, Television and Cable Networks segments.  In addition, Viacom recorded expenses of $17 million associated with its previously announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies by the end of 2005. Viacom has filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the separation.
 
Net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2005 increased 12% to $.47 per diluted share compared with $.42 per diluted share in the prior year, reflecting a 2% increase in net earnings from continuing operations to $735 million from $722 million in the same quarter last year.
 
For the third quarter of 2005, Viacom's free cash flow increased to $879 million from $543 million for the same prior-year period, as higher earnings from continuing operations and improvements in working capital were partially offset by higher cash taxes and increases in capital expenditures.  Free cash flow reflects the Company's net cash flow from operating activities of $1.0 billion less capital expenditures of $134 million.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, revenues increased 9% to $17.3 billion and operating income increased 5% to $4.0 billion, paced by Cable Networks, Entertainment and Outdoor.  Net earnings from continuing operations was $2.1 billion, or $1.30 per diluted share, for the nine-month period compared with $2.1 billion, or $1.19 per diluted share for the same prior-year period which included a tax benefit of $149 million, or $.09 per diluted share, from the resolution of income tax audits and $34 million, net of tax, or $.02 per diluted share for severance charges in 2004.  Excluding these prior year items and the $19 million of expenses incurred during the first nine months of 2005 associated with the Company's separation, net earnings from continuing operations increased 8% with diluted earnings per share growth of 17% for the nine months ended September 30, 2005.
 
Free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $2.6 billion compared with $2.4 billion for the same prior-year period reflecting higher earnings and improvements in working capital partially offset by higher cash taxes and capital expenditures.
 
Sumner M. Redstone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Viacom Inc., said, "Our operating results for the third quarter not only have us on track for achieving our guidance for the year, but also highlight the rationale and promise of our proposed separation into two companies, which we now expect to complete by the end of the year.  The significant strengths of new' Viacom to deliver consistent double digit bottom line growth and the proven cash generation ability of CBS Corporation will underpin their performance and define their attractiveness to investors in the future.
 
"For the third quarter of 2005, we exhibited revenue growth in nearly every major segment, paced by ad sales growth at MTV Networks and BET, as well as at CBS and UPN.  Our radio and television stations also turned in higher results that outpaced their respective industries and our motion picture operations turned in its best summer ever.  Operating income gains from Cable Networks, Entertainment and Outdoor fueled 5% operating income growth in the quarter and more than offset declines in the Television segment, where ad sales increases of 7% were unable to match results from the year-earlier quarter which were driven primarily by the strong initial television syndication sales of the CBS hit franchise series,
 
CSI.
 Additionally, the superior cash flow generation of our operations enabled us to return value to shareholders through our continuing stock purchase program, which was a major contributor to our 12% per diluted share increase in net earnings from continuing operations in the quarter."
 
Business Outlook
 
The Company remains on track to deliver mid single-digit growth in revenues and operating income and high single-digit growth in earnings per share.  The Company's 2005 business outlook is based on 2004 revenues of $22.1 billion, operating income of $5.1 billion and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.54, which reflect Famous Players as a discontinued operation and also excludes the non-cash impairment and severance charges and the tax benefit recorded in 2004.  The 2005 outlook excludes expenses associated with the Company's announced separation.

Free cash flow reflects the Company's net cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures.  The Company uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate its operating performance.  Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs.  As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company's ability to generate long term value.  It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company's operating performance.  The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management.  In addition, free cash flow is also a primary measure used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry.
 
As free cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings (loss) as an indicator of operating performance or net cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity.  Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  In addition, free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs.  As free cash flow deducts capital expenditures from net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are not reflected.  The Company provides below a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable amount reported under GAAP, net cash flow provided by operating activities.
 
The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company's net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow:

The following tables set forth the Company's Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization.  The Company defines "Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization" ("OIBDA") as net earnings adjusted to exclude the following line items presented in its Statement of Operations: Net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax; Minority interest, net of tax; Equity in earnings (loss) of affiliated companies, net of tax; Provision for income taxes; Other items, net; Interest income; Interest expense; and Depreciation and amortization.
 
The Company uses OIBDA, among other things, to evaluate the Company's operating performance, to value prospective acquisitions and as one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel, and this measure is among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods.  This measure is an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance of its business because it provides a link between profitability and operating cash flow.  The Company believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company's management, helps improve their ability to understand the Company's operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company's results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.  In addition, this measure is also among the primary measures used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry.
 
Since OIBDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings (loss) as an indicator of operating performance.  OIBDA, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  In addition, this measure does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use, and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs.  As OIBDA excludes certain financial information compared with net earnings (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are excluded.  As required by the SEC, the Company provides below reconciliations of Total OIBDA to net earnings (loss) and OIBDA for each segment to such segment's operating income, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.
