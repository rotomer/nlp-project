SECTION 3. SECURITIES AND TRADING MARKETS ITEM 3.02 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. On January 5, 2006, CBS Corporation (the "Company") closed its previously announced $325 million acquisition of CSTV Networks, Inc. ("CSTV"). In connection with the acquisition and as part of the consideration to be paid to the former holders of capital stock of CSTV on February 1, 2006, the Company will issue shares of CBS Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share ("CBS Class B Common Stock"), with an aggregate value of approximately $300 million. The precise number of shares of CBS Class B Common Stock to be issued on February 1, 2006 will be determined based on an agreed volume-weighted average trading price for the CBS Class B Common Stock during a period preceding the date of issuance. These shares will be issued in a private placement which is exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The exemption from registration was based on, among other things, the number of former stockholders of CSTV to receive CBS Class B Common Stock and on representations of such stockholders made to the Company. The Company has agreed to make available a shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of such shares of CBS Class B Common Stock no later than February 1, 2006. 2
