All restricted shares and all restricted share units subject to a performance goal granted to Ms. Gordon that would have vested on or before the end of an 18 month period following termination shall accelerate and vest immediately on the date of termination. All restricted share units that were not subject to a performance goal that would otherwise have vested on or before the 18 month period following termination shall accelerate and vest immediately on the date of termination, provided that in no event shall such restricted share units vest in less than three years.
 
The foregoing description of the terms of Ms. Gordon's employment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the employment agreement, dated as of March 1, 2007, between the Company and Susan C. Gordon which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10 and is incorporated herein by reference.

provided
, that if CBS terminates your employment during such period without cause, you shall become eligible to receive severance under the then current CBS severance policy applicable to executives at your level subject to the terms of such severance policy including your execution of a release in favor of CBS.

(a)
The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with Code Section 409A and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance therewith. If you notify CBS (with specificity as to the reason therefor) that you believe that any provision of this Agreement (or of any award of compensation, including equity compensation or benefits) would cause you to incur any additional tax or interest under Code Section 409A and CBS concurs, or CBS (without any obligation whatsoever to do so) independently makes such determination, CBS shall, after consulting with you, use reasonable efforts to reform such provision to the extent possible to comply with Code Section 409A; provided that such modification shall, to the maximum extent practicable, maintain the original intent and economic benefit to you and CBS of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Code Section 409A; and further provided that if CBS, in its sole discretion, determines that reformation or modification is not practical, CBS is under no obligation whatsoever to make such reformation or modification.
 
          
(b)
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to (c) below, if you are deemed on the date of termination to be a "specified employee" within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is required to be delayed in compliance with Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B) such payment or benefit shall not be made or provided (subject to the last sentence hereof) prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of your "separation from service" (as such term is defined under Code Section 409A) or (ii) the date of your death (the "Delay Period"). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this section (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or reimbursed to you immediately in a lump sum less applicable withholding, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the foregoing applies to the provision of any ongoing welfare benefits to you that would not be required to be delayed if the premiums therefore were paid by you, you shall pay the full cost of premiums for such welfare benefits during the Delay Period and CBS shall pay you an amount equal to the amount of such premiums paid by you during the Delay Period promptly after its conclusion.
 
          
(c)
In no event whatsoever (including, but not limited to as a result of paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) above or otherwise) shall CBS be liable for any tax, interest or penalties that may be imposed on you by Code Section 409A or any damages for failing to comply with Section 409A or (a) or (b) above. You acknowledge that you

Arbitration
. If any disagreement or dispute whatsoever shall arise between the parties concerning this Agreement (including the documents referenced herein) or your employment with CBS, the parties hereto agree that such disagreement or dispute shall be submitted to arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), and that a neutral arbitrator will be selected in a manner consistent with its Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures ("Rules"). Such arbitration shall be confidential and private and conducted in accordance with the Rules. Any such arbitration proceeding shall take place in New York City before a single arbitrator (rather than a panel of arbitrators). The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have no authority to award any punitive or exemplary damages and waive, to the full extent permitted by law, any right to recover such damages in such arbitration. Each party shall bear its respective costs (including attorney's fees, and there shall be no award of attorney's fees). Judgment upon the final award rendered by such arbitrator, after giving effect to the AAA internal appeals process, may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, CBS shall be entitled to seek injunctive, provisional and equitable relief in a court proceeding as a result of your alleged violation of the terms of Section 6 of this Agreement, and you hereby consent and agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction in any state or federal court located in the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan.
