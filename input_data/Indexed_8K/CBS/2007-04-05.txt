On March 30, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of CBS Corporation (the "Company") established the performance criteria to be used with respect to annual grants of performance-based equity awards in 2007 under the Company's 2004 Long-Term Management Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "LTMIP"), excluding grants where the performance criteria is set pursuant to an employment agreement. The 2007 performance-based equity awards will be delivered as performance-based restricted share units ("RSUs") and performance share units ("PSUs"). The performance criteria for performance-based RSUs is based on the financial performance of the Company over a one-year period ending December 31, 2007 weighted (i) 75% on the achievement of specified levels of OIBDA Without Inter-Company Eliminations and (ii) 25% on the achievement of specified levels of Free Cash Flow, in each case as such terms are defined in the LTMIP. The performance criteria for PSUs is tied to the achievement of a performance goal based on the relative total shareholder return of the Company's Class B common stock in comparison to the total shareholder return of the common stock of companies in a Standard & Poor's 500 group measured over a three-year period and, under certain circumstances, based on the relative total shareholder return in the last year of the three-year measurement period or Free Cash Flow.
 
A copy of the LTMIP has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10 to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006.
