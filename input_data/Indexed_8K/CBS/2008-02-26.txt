Exhibit 99
New York, New York, February 26, 2008  CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS.A and CBS) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2007.
 
"I'm very pleased that CBS has turned in another solid quarter while making significant strides in the expanding interactive marketplace," said Sumner Redstone, Executive Chairman, CBS Corporation.  "At the same time, the Company remained steadfast in delivering on its promises and returning significant value to investors.  Leslie and his team continue to lead the Company with distinction, capitalizing upon our strength today and positioning CBS for success in the months and years to come."
 
"We finished 2007 with our businesses well poised to increase revenues and profits in 2008 and beyond," said Leslie Moonves, President and Chief Executive Officer, CBS Corporation.  "In Television, I'm particularly pleased with the recent resolution of the WGA strike, which has restored stability to the network season.  Meanwhile, Outdoor and Publishing had exceptionally strong performances for the year, with Outdoor picking up momentum to deliver a strong double-digit OIBDA gain in the fourth quarter.  Our businesses produced a significant amount of free cash flow and, during the year, we returned $4 billion of cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  At the same time, we used a prudent portion of our cash to invest in higher-growth properties like the online social networking community Last.fm and digital outdoor displays both domestically and overseas."
 
Fourth Quarter 2007 Results
 
Revenues of $3.76 billion for the fourth quarter of 2007 decreased 3% from $3.88 billion for the same quarter last year.  The television and radio station divestitures, the non-renewal of several marginally profitable outdoor transit contracts, and record political advertising sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 negatively impacted the fourth quarter revenue comparison by 4%.
 
Operating income before depreciation and amortization ("OIBDA") of $824.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 4% from $794.9 million and operating income of $704.8 million increased 3% from $681.5 million for the same prior-year period, reflecting growth at Outdoor, lower residual costs and the impairment charge recorded in 2006.  Stock-based compensation expense for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $25.8 million versus $12.6 million for the same quarter in 2006.
 
Net earnings from continuing operations on an adjusted basis were $366.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 versus $410.6 million for the same prior-year period, reflecting a higher effective income tax rate of 35.3% for 2007 versus 28.6% for 2006.  Despite the higher income tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 2% to $.54 from $.53 for the same prior-year period due to the impact of the 2007 share repurchases.  Adjusted results exclude the write-down of investments, and the impact of station divestitures and favorable tax settlements.  Reported net earnings from continuing operations were $273.1 million, or $.40 per diluted share, versus $335.0 million, or $.43 per diluted share, for the prior-year period.
 
Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased $137.1 million to $122.4 million from $(14.7) million for the same prior-year period.   The Company's free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2007 and 2006 was reduced by discretionary contributions of $150.0 million and $200.0 million, respectively, to pre-fund its qualified pension plans.
Full Year 2007 Results
 
Revenues of $14.07 billion for the full year 2007 decreased 2% from $14.32 billion for 2006.  The absence of UPN, the television and radio station divestitures and the non-renewal of several marginally profitable outdoor transit contracts negatively impacted the full year revenue comparison by 3%.  Revenues in 2007 were favorably impacted by the 2007 telecast of and growth at Outdoor and Publishing.  OIBDA of $3.08 billion for 2007 increased 1% from $3.05 billion for 2006 and operating income of $2.62 billion for 2007 also increased 1% from $2.61 billion for 2006.  Stock-based compensation expense was $106.6 million for 2007 versus $64.3 million for 2006.
Super Bowl XLI
 
Net earnings from continuing operations on an adjusted basis increased 3% to $1.36 billion for 2007 from $1.33 billion for 2006.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 9% to $1.88 from $1.72 for 2006 due in part to the impact of the 2007 share repurchases.  Reported net earnings from continuing operations for 2007 were $1.23 billion, or $1.70 per diluted share, versus $1.38 billion, or $1.79 per diluted share, for 2006.
 
Full year 2007 free cash flow increased 6% to $1.71 billion from $1.61 billion for 2006.
 
Business Outlook
 
The Company expects OIBDA and operating income growth to be in the range of 3% to 5% for 2008, excluding stock-based compensation expense.  The Company's 2008 business outlook is based on 2007 OIBDA of $3.18 billion and operating income of $2.73 billion, which exclude stock-based compensation expense.

Outdoor
(CBS Outdoor)
 
Fourth Quarter
 
Outdoor revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased 7% to $618.6 million from $580.6 million for the same prior-year period led by an 18% increase in Europe and Asia, principally due to growth in the U.K. market and favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and growth in the U.S. billboard business.  In constant dollars, Outdoor revenues increased 2% for the quarter.  North America revenues for the fourth quarter increased slightly from the prior year as growth of 9% in U.S. billboards, 9% in Canada and 19% in Mexico was offset by a 27% decline in U.S. transit and displays, reflecting the non-renewal of marginally profitable transit and street furniture contracts in New York City and Chicago.
 
Outdoor OIBDA and operating income increased 19% to $198.9 million and 29% to $142.8 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2007 reflecting growth in North America and in Europe and Asia.

In constant dollars, Outdoor revenues increased slightly over 2006.  Revenues for North America decreased 1% for 2007 as a result of a 28% decline in

Europe and Asia OIBDA decreased 5% to $102.5 million and operating income decreased 13% to $68.4 million as the revenue growth was more than offset by higher transit lease costs, primarily in the U.K.  Outdoor results included stock-based compensation of $5.3 million and $3.2 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization ("OIBDA")
 
The following tables set forth the Company's Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.  The Company defines "Operating Income before Depreciation and Amortization" ("OIBDA") as net earnings adjusted to exclude the following line items presented in its Statements of Operations: Net earnings from discontinued operations; Minority interest, net of tax; Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax; Provision for income taxes; Other items, net; Loss on early extinguishment of debt; Interest income; Interest expense; and Depreciation and amortization.  The Company defines "OIBDA before impairment charges" as OIBDA less non-cash impairment charges.
 
The Company presents OIBDA before impairment charges on a segment basis as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in accordance with SFAS 131, "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."
 
The Company uses OIBDA, among other things, to evaluate the Company's operating performance, to value prospective acquisitions and as one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel, and this measure is among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods.  This measure is an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance of its business because it provides a link between profitability and operating cash flow.  The Company believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company's management, helps improve their ability to understand the Company's operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company's results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.  In addition, this measure is also among the primary measures used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry.
 
Since OIBDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings as an indicator of operating performance.  OIBDA, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  In addition, this measure does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use, and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs.  As OIBDA excludes certain financial information compared with net earnings, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are excluded.  The Company provides the following reconciliations of Total OIBDA to Net earnings and OIBDA before impairment charges for each segment to such segment's operating income, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.

Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow reflects the Company's net cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures and operating cash flow of discontinued operations.  The Company uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate its operating performance.  Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs.  As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company's ability to generate long term value.  It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company's operating performance.  The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management.  In addition, free cash flow is also a primary measure used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry.
 
As free cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or net cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity.  Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  In addition, free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs.  As free cash flow deducts capital expenditures and operating cash flow of discontinued operations from net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are not reflected.  The Company provides below a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable amount reported under GAAP.
 
The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company's net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow:

The following tables reconcile financial measures excluding the write-down of investments, the impact of the pre-tax gain or loss and related tax provision of the television and radio station divestitures, and favorable tax settlements, to the reported measures included in this earnings release.  The Company believes that adjusting its financial results for the impact of these items is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company's management, provides a clearer perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company and makes it easier to compare the Company's year-over-year results.

Radio Segment "Same Station" Reconciliation
 
The Company has completed all of the previously announced sales of 39 radio stations in ten of its smaller markets.  The following table presents the revenues for the Radio segment on a "same station" basis, which excludes all revenues for the divested stations, for all periods presented.  The Company believes that adjusting the revenues of the Radio segment for the impact of station divestitures provides investors with a clearer perspective on the current underlying financial performance of the Radio segment.
 
 
Business Outlook
 
The following table presents the Company's business outlook for 2008, which is based on 2007 results adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense. The Company believes that providing its business outlook excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense is relevant and meaningful because it provides management and investors with a clearer perspective on the Company's underlying growth. The Company currently expects stock-based compensation expense in 2008 to be in the range of $155 million to $165 million compared to $106.6 million in 2007.
