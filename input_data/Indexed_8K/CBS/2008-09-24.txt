Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement dated December 29, 2005 between CBS Corporation ("CBS" or the "Company") and Sumner M. Redstone, Executive Chairman and Founder of the Company, as amended by a letter agreement dated March 13, 2007, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company conducted its annual review of elements of Mr. Redstone's compensation. Following the Committee's review and discussions, as well as review and approval by the Company's independent directors, on September 21, 2008 it was determined to award Mr. Redstone stock options to purchase 445,000 shares of CBS Class B Common Stock under the Company's 2004 Long-Term Management Incentive Plan.
 
The stock option grant was effective on September 22, 2008 and has a per share exercise price of $15.39, the closing price of a share of CBS Class B Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on September 22, 2008. The stock options will vest in four equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant and will expire on the eighth anniversary of the date of grant. The options will contain other terms and conditions substantially the same as stock option grants to other CBS executives, which terms and conditions have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.3 to the Company's Form 8-K filed February 1, 2005.
 
A copy of the employment agreement dated December 29, 2005 between the Company and Mr. Redstone has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Form 8-K filed December 30, 2005 and a copy of the letter agreement dated March 13, 2007 between the Company and Mr. Redstone has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10 to the Company's Form 8-K filed March 16, 2007.
