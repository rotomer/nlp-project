This analysis resulted in a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $14.12 billion.  Due principally to this non-cash impairment charge, reported OIBDA for the third quarter of 2008 was a loss of $13.48 billion and operating income was a loss of $13.62 billion, versus OIBDA of $757.6 million and operating income of $645.8 million for the same quarter last year.  Stock-based compensation expense for the third quarter of 2008 was $38.3 million versus $29.3 million for the same quarter last year.  Reported net earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2008 were a loss of $12.46 billion, or a loss of $18.58 per diluted share, versus earnings of $340.2 million, or $.48 per diluted share, for the same prior-year period.

Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2008 was a net cash outflow of $38.1 million versus a net cash inflow of $265.5 million for the same prior-year period.  The third quarter cash outflow was affected by the timing of certain capital and programming investments.

Nine Months 2008 Results
Revenues of $10.42 billion for the first nine months of 2008 increased 1% from the same prior-year period reflecting higher syndication revenues, primarily as a result of the new international self-distribution arrangement for the franchise and the domestic cable syndication sale of , higher affiliate revenues, Outdoor revenue growth and the acquisition of CNET.

Television revenues for the third quarter of 2008 increased 2% to $2.08 billion from $2.04 billion for the same prior-year period primarily due to higher television license fees, home entertainment and affiliate revenues partially offset by lower advertising sales.  Television license fees increased 41% driven largely by the cable syndication sale of .

Radio
(CBS Radio)
Radio revenues for the third quarter of 2008 decreased 12% to $392.5 million from $445.7 million for the same prior-year period, reflecting weakness in the advertising market and the impact of radio station divestitures.  On a same station basis, Radio revenues declined 11% from the third quarter of 2007.
 
Radio OIBDA and operating income for the third quarter of 2008, in each case before impairment charges, decreased 18% to $139.4 million and 19% to $130.6 million, respectively.  These declines were due to lower advertising sales and the absence of profits from divested stations partially offset by lower talent and employee-related expenses and decreased marketing and promotion costs resulting from restructuring and cost-saving initiatives.  Radio results included stock-based compensation expense of $5.6 million and $3.9 million for the third quarter of 2008 and 2007, respectively.
 
Outdoor
(CBS Outdoor)
Outdoor revenues for the third quarter of 2008 decreased 1% to $549.3 million from $552.2 million for the same prior-year period.  Revenues for Outdoor International (which is composed of Europe, Asia and South America) increased 5% principally due to the acquisition of International Outdoor Advertising Group ("IOA") and growth in China partially offset by revenue declines in the U.K., Italy and the Netherlands, which have been adversely affected by current market conditions in Europe. 
Revenues in North America (which is composed of the United States, Canada and Mexico) decreased 4% for the quarter primarily due to a decline in the U.S. billboards businesses.  The non-renewal of two major municipal contracts in Toronto and San Francisco negatively affected the North America revenues comparison by 2% for the quarter.
 
Outdoor OIBDA and operating income, in each case before impairment charges, decreased 26% to $113.9 million and 48% to $51.8 million, respectively, for the third quarter of 2008.  North America OIBDA decreased 20% to $107.0 million and operating income decreased 32% to $60.3 million due to the revenue decline combined with higher transit and billboard lease costs and the aforementioned non-renewal of municipal contracts.  International OIBDA decreased to $6.9 million from $19.2 million for the same quarter last year principally reflecting increased transit costs as well as $4.0 million of restructuring costs incurred during the third quarter of 2008.  International reported an operating loss of $8.5 million for the third quarter of 2008 versus operating income of $10.5 million for the same prior-year period due to higher depreciation expense associated with recent capital expenditures.

Interactive OIBDA of $2.5 million for the third quarter of 2008 increased from a loss of $11.2 million for the same prior-year period due to the acquisition of CNET.  Interactive reported an operating loss of $15.2 million for the third quarter of 2008 versus an operating loss of $13.3 million for the same prior-year period resulting from increased non-cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with higher intangible and fixed asset balances resulting from the acquisition of CNET.

Operating Income (Loss) Before Depreciation and Amortization
 
The following tables set forth the Company's Operating Income (Loss) Before Depreciation and Amortization ("OIBDA") for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007.  The Company defines OIBDA as net earnings (loss) adjusted to exclude the following line items presented in its Statements of Operations: Net earnings from discontinued operations; Minority interest, net of tax; Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax; Provision for income taxes; Other items, net; Interest income; Interest expense; and Depreciation and amortization.  The Company defines "OIBDA Before Impairment Charges" as OIBDA less impairment charges.
 
The Company presents OIBDA Before Impairment Charges on a segment basis as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in accordance with SFAS 131, "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."
 
The Company uses OIBDA, among other things, to evaluate the Company's operating performance, to value prospective acquisitions and as one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel, and this measure is among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods.  This measure is an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance of its business because it provides a link between profitability and operating cash flow.  The Company believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company's management, helps improve their ability to understand the Company's operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company's results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.  In addition, this measure is also among the primary measures used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry.
 
Since OIBDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings (loss) as an indicator of operating performance.  OIBDA, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  In addition, this measure does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use, and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs.  As OIBDA excludes certain financial information compared with net earnings (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are excluded.  The Company provides the following reconciliations of total OIBDA to net earnings (loss) and OIBDA Before Impairment Charges for each segment to such segment's operating income (loss), the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.

Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow reflects the Company's net cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures and operating cash flow of discontinued operations.  The Company uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate its operating performance.  Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs.  As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company's ability to generate long term value.  It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company's operating performance.  The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management.  In addition, free cash flow is also a primary measure used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry.
 
and operating cash flow of discontinued operations
As free cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings (loss) as an indicator of operating performance or net cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity.  Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  In addition, free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs.  As free cash flow deducts capital expenditures
from net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are not reflected.  The Company provides below a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable amount reported under GAAP.
 
The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company's net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow:

During 2007, the Company completed the sales of 39 radio stations in ten of its smaller markets.  The following table presents the revenues for the Radio segment on a same station basis, which excludes all revenues for the divested stations, for all periods presented.  The Company believes that adjusting the revenues of the Radio segment for the impact of station divestitures provides investors with a clearer perspective on the current underlying financial performance of the Radio segment.
