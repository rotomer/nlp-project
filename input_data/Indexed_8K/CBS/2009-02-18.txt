Operating Income (Loss) Before Depreciation and Amortization
 
The following tables set forth the Company's Operating Income (Loss) Before Depreciation and Amortization ("OIBDA") for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.  The Company defines OIBDA as net earnings (loss) adjusted to exclude the following line items presented in its Statements of Operations: Net earnings from discontinued operations; Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax; (Provision) benefit for income taxes; Other items, net; Gain on early extinguishment of debt; Interest income; Interest expense; and Depreciation and amortization.  The Company defines "OIBDA Before Impairment Charges" as OIBDA less impairment charges.
 
The Company presents OIBDA Before Impairment Charges on a segment basis as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in accordance with SFAS 131, "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."
 
The Company uses OIBDA, among other things, to evaluate the Company's operating performance, to value prospective acquisitions and as one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel, and this measure is among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods.  This measure is an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance of its business because it provides a link between profitability and operating cash flow.  The Company believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company's management, helps improve their ability to understand the Company's operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company's results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.  In addition, this measure is also among the primary measures used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry.
 
Since OIBDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings (loss) as an indicator of operating performance.  OIBDA, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  In addition, this measure does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use, and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs.  As OIBDA excludes certain financial information compared with net earnings (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are excluded.  The Company provides the following reconciliations of total OIBDA to net earnings (loss) and OIBDA Before Impairment Charges for each segment to such segment's operating income (loss), the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.

Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow reflects the Company's net cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures and operating cash flow of discontinued operations.  The Company uses free cash flow, among other measures, to evaluate its operating performance.  Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs.  As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company's ability to generate long term value.  It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company's operating performance.  The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management.  In addition, free cash flow is also a primary measure used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry.
 
As free cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings (loss) as an indicator of operating performance or net cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity.  Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  In addition, free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs.  As free cash flow deducts capital expenditures and operating cash flow of discontinued operations from net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are not reflected.  The Company provides below a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable amount reported under GAAP.
 
The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company's net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow:

Interactive Segment Comparable Revenues Reconciliation
 
The Company acquired CNET on June 30, 2008.  The following table presents the revenues for the Interactive segment on a comparable basis, which includes the revenues of CNET for all periods presented.  The Company believes that adjusting the revenues of the Interactive segment to include CNET prior to acquisition provides investors with a clearer perspective on the current underlying financial performance of the Interactive segment.
