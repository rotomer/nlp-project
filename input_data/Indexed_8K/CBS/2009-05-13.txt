The Notes are guaranteed on an unsecured basis (the "Guarantees") by CBS Operations Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"). The Notes and the Guarantees are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Securities." The Securities will be issued pursuant to an Amended and Restated Senior Indenture dated as of November 3, 2008 (as so amended and supplemented from time to time, the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantor and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "Trustee").

other things, the Securities. The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the 1933 Act. The Registration Statement is an "automatic shelf registration statement", as defined in Rule 405 of the 1933 Act, that initially became effective not earlier than three years prior to the date hereof, and the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act"). The prospectus included in the Registration Statement is hereinafter referred to as the "Base Prospectus." The Base Prospectus, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities in the form first used to confirm sales of the Securities (or in the form first made available to the Underwriters by the Company to meet requests of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the 1933 Act) is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus," and the term "Preliminary Prospectus" means the preliminary form of the Prospectus dated May 8, 2009. For purposes of this Agreement, "free writing prospectus" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act, and "Time of Sale Prospectus" means the Preliminary Prospectus together with the free writing prospectuses, if any, each identified in Annex A hereto. As used herein, the terms "Registration Statement," "Base Prospectus," "Preliminary Prospectus," "Time of Sale Prospectus" and "Prospectus" shall include the documents, if any, incorporated by reference therein. Any reference herein to the terms "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus and the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any document under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), after the date of this Underwriting Agreement, or the issue date of the Base Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated therein by reference.

The Registration Statement, as of the most recent effective date, did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The Time of Sale Prospectus, at May 8, 2009, did not, and at the Closing Time, will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Prospectus, as of its date and on the Closing Time, will comply, in all material respects, with the applicable provisions of the 1933 Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; , , that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) of the Trustee under the 1939 Act or (ii) the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto.

No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding or claim.
provided
however
     7. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and of the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
Contribution
     The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities under this Underwriting Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.
     The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
 
relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company, the Guarantor and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule 1 hereto, and not joint.
     8. . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Underwriting Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or controlling person, or by or on behalf of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

     (b) If this Underwriting Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section 4 hereof, and provided further that Sections 6, 7, 8, this paragraph 9(b) and Section 13 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect; , , if any condition specified in Section 5 hereof shall not have been fulfilled when and as required to be fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice to the Company at any time at or prior to the Closing Time, and such termination shall be without liability of any other party except that (i) the Company shall reimburse the Underwriters for all their reasonable out of pocket expenses including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Underwriters and (ii) the provisions of Sections 6, 7, 8, this paragraph 9(b) and Section 13 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

     (b) if the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth on Schedule 1 hereto, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such non-defaulting Underwriters
 
do not purchase all the Securities, this Underwriting Agreement will terminate without liability to any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company.
     No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.
     In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of this Underwriting Agreement, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

The interest rate payable on the Securities of this series will be subject to adjustment from time to time if either Moody's or S&P or, in either case, any Substitute rating agency (as defined below) downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Securities of this series, in the manner described below.

Moody's

S&P
               "" means a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Company's board of directors or a committee designated by the Company's board of directors) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both of them, as the case may be.
Substitute rating agency
 
               If the rating from Moody's (or any Substitute rating agency) of the Securities of this series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Securities of this series will increase such that it will equal the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
               If the rating from S&P (or any Substitute rating agency) of the Securities of this series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Securities of this series will increase such that it will equal the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
               If at any time the interest rate on the Securities of this series has been adjusted upward as a result of a decrease in a rating by either Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute rating agency), as the case may be, and subsequently such rating agency increases its rating of the Securities of this series to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on the Securities of this series will be decreased such that the interest rate for the Securities of this series will equal the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance plus the percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase in rating. If the rating by Moody's (or any Substitute rating agency) of the Securities of this series is or becomes Baa3 (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute rating agency) or higher, and the rating by S&P (or any Substitute rating agency thereof) is or becomes BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute rating agency) or higher, the interest rate on the Securities of this series will be decreased to the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance. In addition, the interest rates on the Securities of this series will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both rating agencies) if the Securities of this series become rated A3 and A- (or the equivalent of either such rating, in the case of a Substitute rating agency) or higher by Moody's and S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute rating agency thereof), respectively (or one of these ratings if the Securities of this series are only rated by one rating agency).
               Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute rating agency), shall be made independent of (and in addition to) any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (a) the
 
interest rate for the Securities of this series be reduced to below the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance or (b) the total increase in the interest rate on the Securities of this series exceed 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance.
               No adjustments in the interest rate of the Securities of this series shall be made solely as a result of a rating agency ceasing to provide a rating of the Securities of this series. If at any time Moody's or S&P ceases to provide a rating of the Securities of this series, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Securities of this series from a Substitute rating agency, to the extent one exists, and if a Substitute rating agency exists, for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the Securities of this series pursuant to the tables above (a) such Substitute rating agency will be substituted for the last rating agency to provide a rating of the Securities of this series but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b) the relative rating scale used by such Substitute rating agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the applicable table above with respect to such Substitute rating agency, such ratings will be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's or S&P, as applicable, in such table and (c) the interest rate on the Securities of this series will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute rating agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above) (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other rating agency). For so long as only one of Moody's or S&P provides a rating of the Securities of this series and no Substitute rating agency is offered to replace the other rating agency, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Securities of this series necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency providing the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. For so long as none of Moody's, S&P or a Substitute rating agency provides a rating of the Securities of this series, the interest rate on the Securities of this series will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance.
               Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect on the next Business Day after the rating change has occurred.
               If the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series is increased as described in this "Interest Rate Adjustment" Section, the term "interest," as used with respect to the Securities of this series, will be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.

Holders of record on a record date that is on or prior to a redemption date will be entitled to receive interest due on the interest payment date. In the event of a deposit or withdrawal of an interest in this Security, including an exchange, transfer, redemption or conversion of this Security in part only, the Trustee, as custodian of the Depositary, shall make an adjustment on its

records to reflect such deposit or withdrawal in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Depositary.
               "" means, the excess, if any, of (a) the aggregate present value as of the date of the redemption of the principal being redeemed and the amount of interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) that would have been payable if redemption had not been made, determined by discounting, on a semiannual basis, the remaining principal and interest at the Reinvestment Rate described below (determined on the third business day preceding the date notice of redemption is given) from the dates on which the principal and interest would have been payable if the redemption had not been made, to the date of redemption, over (b) the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series.
Make-Whole Amount

If no maturity exactly corresponds to the maturity, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the maturity would be so calculated and the Reinvestment Rate would be interpolated or extrapolated on a straight-line basis, rounding to the nearest month. The most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 published prior to the date of determination of the Make-Whole Amount will be used for purposes of calculating the Reinvestment Rate.
Reinvestment Rate
               The Make-Whole Amount will be calculated by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company. If the Company fails to make the appointment at least 45 business days prior to the date of redemption, or if the institution is unwilling or unable to make the calculation, the calculation will be made by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee.
               If the Reinvestment Rate is not available as described above, the Reinvestment Rate will be calculated by interpolation or extrapolation of comparable rates selected by the independent investment banking institution.
               In the case of any partial redemption, selection of the Securities of this series for redemption will be made by the Trustee in compliance with the requirements of the principal U.S. national securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities of this series are listed or, if they are not listed on a U.S. national securities exchange, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion deems to be fair and appropriate.

Authorized Denominations

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, this Security will be held by DTC or its nominee, and beneficial interests will be held by beneficial owners through the book-entry facilities of DTC or its nominee in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000.

Book-Entry Security
          . If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
Event of Default
          . The interest rate payable on the Securities of this series will be subject to adjustment from time to time if either Moody's or S&P or, in either case, any Substitute rating agency (as defined below) downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the debt rating assigned to the Securities of this series, in the manner described below.
Interest Rate Adjustment
               "" means Moody's Investors Service, Inc., a subsidiary of Moody's Corporation, and its successors.
Moody's
               "" means Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., and its successors.
S&P
 
               "" means a "nationally recognized statistical rating organization" within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company (as certified by a resolution of the Company's board of directors or a committee designated by the Company's board of directors) as a replacement agency for Moody's or S&P, or both of them, as the case may be.
Substitute rating agency
               If the rating from Moody's (or any Substitute rating agency) of the Securities of this series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Securities of this series will increase such that it will equal the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
               If the rating from S&P (or any Substitute rating agency) of the Securities of this series is decreased to a rating set forth in the immediately following table, the interest rate on the Securities of this series will increase such that it will equal the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance plus the percentage set forth opposite the ratings from the table below:
 
               If at any time the interest rate on the Securities of this series has been adjusted upward as a result of a decrease in a rating by either Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute rating agency), as the case may be, and subsequently such rating agency increases its rating of the Securities of this series to any of the threshold ratings set forth above, the interest rate on the Securities of this series will be decreased such that the interest rate for the Securities of this series will equal the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance plus the percentages set forth opposite the ratings from the tables above in effect immediately following the increase in rating. If the rating by Moody's (or any Substitute rating agency) of the Securities of this series is or becomes Baa3 (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute rating agency) or higher, and the rating by S&P (or any Substitute rating agency thereof) is or becomes BBB- (or its equivalent, in the case of a Substitute rating agency) or higher, the interest rate on the Securities of this series will be decreased to the interest rate
 
payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance. In addition, the interest rates on the Securities of this series will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment described above (notwithstanding any subsequent decrease in the ratings by either or both rating agencies) if the Securities of this series become rated A3 and A- (or the equivalent of either such rating, in the case of a Substitute rating agency) or higher by Moody's and S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute rating agency thereof), respectively (or one of these ratings if the Securities of this series are only rated by one rating agency).
               Each adjustment required by any decrease or increase in a rating set forth above, whether occasioned by the action of Moody's or S&P (or, in either case, a Substitute rating agency), shall be made independent of (and in addition to) any and all other adjustments. In no event shall (a) the interest rate for the Securities of this series be reduced to below the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance or (b) the total increase in the interest rate on the Securities of this series exceed 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance.
               No adjustments in the interest rate of the Securities of this series shall be made solely as a result of a rating agency ceasing to provide a rating of the Securities of this series. If at any time Moody's or S&P ceases to provide a rating of the Securities of this series, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a rating of the Securities of this series from a Substitute rating agency, to the extent one exists, and if a Substitute rating agency exists, for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the interest rate on the Securities of this series pursuant to the tables above (a) such Substitute rating agency will be substituted for the last rating agency to provide a rating of the Securities of this series but which has since ceased to provide such rating, (b) the relative rating scale used by such Substitute rating agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good faith by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company and, for purposes of determining the applicable ratings included in the applicable table above with respect to such Substitute rating agency, such ratings will be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's or S&P, as applicable, in such table and (c) the interest rate on the Securities of this series will increase or decrease, as the case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance plus the appropriate percentage, if any, set forth opposite the rating from such Substitute rating agency in the applicable table above (taking into account the provisions of clause (b) above) (plus any applicable percentage resulting from a decreased rating by the other rating agency). For so long as only one of Moody's or S&P provides a rating of the Securities of this series and no Substitute rating agency is offered to replace the other rating agency, any subsequent increase or decrease in the interest rate of the Securities of this series necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency providing the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table above. For so long as none of Moody's, S&P or a Substitute rating agency provides a rating of the Securities of this series, the interest rate on the Securities of this series will increase to, or remain at, as the case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series on the date of their issuance.
               Any interest rate increase or decrease described above will take effect on the next Business Day after the rating change has occurred.
 
               If the interest rate payable on the Securities of this series is increased as described in this "Interest Rate Adjustment" Section, the term "interest," as used with respect to the Securities of this series, will be deemed to include any such additional interest unless the context otherwise requires.
          . The Securities of this series are not subject to any sinking fund and are subject to redemption prior to maturity as set forth below.
Redemption and Maturity
               Prior to maturity, the Securities of this series may be redeemed, at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, at a redemption price equal to the sum of 100% of the principal amount redeemed, the Make-Whole Amount (as defined below) and any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Holders of record on a record date that is on or prior to a redemption date will be entitled to receive interest due on the interest payment date. In the event of a deposit or withdrawal of an interest in this Security, including an exchange, transfer, redemption or conversion of this Security in part only, the Trustee, as custodian of the Depositary, shall make an adjustment on its records to reflect such deposit or withdrawal in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Depositary.
Optional Redemption.
               "" means, the excess, if any, of (a) the aggregate present value as of the date of the redemption of the principal being redeemed and the amount of interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) that would have been payable if redemption had not been made, determined by discounting, on a semiannual basis, the remaining principal and interest at the Reinvestment Rate described below (determined on the third business day preceding the date notice of redemption is given) from the dates on which the principal and interest would have been payable if the redemption had not been made, to the date of redemption, over (b) the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series.
Make-Whole Amount
               "" means 0.75% for the Securities of this series plus the arithmetic mean of the yields under the heading "Week Ending" published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities" for the maturity (rounded to the nearest month) corresponding to the remaining life to maturity, as of the payment date of the principal being redeemed or paid. If no maturity exactly corresponds to the maturity, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the maturity would be so calculated and the Reinvestment Rate would be interpolated or extrapolated on a straight-line basis, rounding to the nearest month. The most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 published prior to the date of determination of the Make-Whole Amount will be used for purposes of calculating the Reinvestment Rate.
Reinvestment Rate
               The Make-Whole Amount will be calculated by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company. If the Company fails to make the appointment at least 45 business days prior to the date of redemption, or if the institution is unwilling or unable to make the calculation, the calculation will be made by an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee.
 
               If the Reinvestment Rate is not available as described above, the Reinvestment Rate will be calculated by interpolation or extrapolation of comparable rates selected by the independent investment banking institution.
               In the case of any partial redemption, selection of the Securities of this series for redemption will be made by the Trustee in compliance with the requirements of the principal U.S. national securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities of this series are listed or, if they are not listed on a U.S. national securities exchange, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion deems to be fair and appropriate.
          . Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event (as defined below) in respect of the Securities of this series, unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the Securities of this series as described in the "Optional Redemption" Section, each Holder will have the right to require that the Company repurchase all or a portion (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's Securities of this series pursuant to the offer described below (the ""), at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.

                    (v) that, unless the Company shall default in the payment of the purchase price, any Security accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Repurchase Event Payment Date; and

               (d) The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Securities of this series as a result of a Change of Control Repurchase Event.
