CBS Corporation ("CBS" or the "Company") announced on June 22, 2009 that its Board of Directors had elected Joseph R. Ianniello as the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective July 20, 2009. On September 30, 2009, the Company entered into an agreement (the "Agreement") for the continued employment of Mr. Ianniello in his new position as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CBS. The term of the Agreement commences on July 20, 2009 and ends on July 20, 2013, subject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
 
Under the terms of the Agreement, Mr. Ianniello's annual base salary is $1.5 million, which may be increased during the employment term in the Company's discretion. Mr. Ianniello will be eligible to receive an annual bonus determined in accordance with the guidelines of the Company's short-term incentive program based on a target bonus for each calendar year of 200% of his base salary as in effect on November 1st of the calendar year. Mr. Ianniello is also eligible to receive annual grants under the Company's long-term incentive plan, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Compensation Committee"), having a target value equal to $3 million. The Agreement also entitles Mr. Ianniello to participate in arrangements for benefits available to other senior executives of CBS and contains non-compete obligations and other covenants during Mr. Ianniello's employment and for specified periods after the termination of his employment.
 
In the event of Mr. Ianniello's termination of employment by the Company without "cause" or for "good reason" (as such terms are defined in the Agreement) during the employment term, Mr. Ianniello is entitled to receive a severance amount equal to two times the sum of his salary and target bonus, both as in effect at the time of his termination. Mr. Ianniello will also receive certain health and insurance benefits for 24 months following his termination. In the case of termination without "cause", all unvested stock options and all unvested restricted share units ("RSUs") will accelerate and vest on the date Mr. Ianniello delivers a general release in form satisfactory to CBS and such release becomes effective and irrevocable (the "Release Effective Date"). In the case of termination for "good reason", a specified portion of each of Mr. Ianniello's unvested stock options and unvested RSUs will accelerate and vest on the Release Effective Date. All accelerated stock options and all previously vested stock options will remain exercisable for the greater of 24 months after the termination date or the period provided in accordance with the terms of the applicable grant, provided that in no event shall the exercise period of any award extend beyond their expiration date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that compliance with the performance-based compensation exception is required in order to ensure the deductibility of any of Mr. Ianniello's RSUs under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), such RSUs shall vest if and when the Compensation Committee certifies that the performance goal relating to any such RSUs has been met, or, if later, the Release Effective Date. In addition, to the extent that Mr. Ianniello is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, payment of any amounts that constitute deferred compensation under Section 409A may be delayed as necessary to comply with Section 409A. Mr. Ianniello is not required to mitigate the termination payment amounts described above by seeking other employment.
 
The foregoing description of the terms of Mr. Ianniello's employment agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, dated as of July 20, 2009, between CBS Corporation and Joseph R. Ianniello, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10 and is incorporated herein by reference.

(II)

You may resign your employment under this Agreement with Good Reason at any time during the Term by written notice of termination to CBS given no more than thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the event constituting Good Reason. Such notice shall state an effective resignation date that is not earlier than thirty (30) business days and not later than sixty (60) days after the date it is given to CBS,
provided
that CBS may set an earlier effective date for your resignation at any time after receipt of your notice. For purposes of this Agreement (and any other agreement that expressly incorporates the definition of Good Reason hereunder), "
Good Reason
" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following without your consent (other than in connection with the termination or suspension of your employment or duties for Cause or in connection with physical and mental incapacity): (A) the requirement that you report on an ongoing basis to an executive at a level lower than the level of the executive to whom you reported on the Effective Date; (B) the material breach by CBS of its obligations under this Agreement, including a material reduction in the scope of your responsibilities or title, or a material reduction in your base compensation (as set forth in paragraph 3 of this Agreement); or (C)
a Material Reduction, as defined in
Exhibit A
attached hereto. CBS shall have thirty (30) days from the receipt of your notice within which to cure and, in the event of such cure, your notice shall be of no further force or effect;
provided
,
however
, that in the event of a Material Reduction, the thirty (30) day cure period shall be extended to ninety (90) days. If no cure is effected, your resignation will be effective as of the date specified in your written notice to CBS or such earlier effective date set by CBS following receipt of your notice.

,
further
, that you may elect to continue your medical and dental insurance coverage under COBRA at your own expense for the balance, if any, of the period required by law;

further
, that to the extent that you are a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A and determined pursuant to procedures adopted by CBS) at the time of your termination and any portion of your RSUs that would otherwise be settled during the six-month period following your termination of employment constitutes "deferred compensation" within the meaning of Code Section 409A, such portion shall be settled on the Permissible Payment Date.

x
) you shall have executed and delivered to CBS a general release in a form satisfactory to CBS and (
y
) such general release shall have become effective and irrevocable in its entirety (such date, the "
Release Effective Date
");

,
however
, that if, at the time any cash severance payments are scheduled to be paid to you pursuant to paragraph 7(b)(ii) or 7(c)(ii), as applicable, you have not executed a general release that has become effective and irrevocable in its entirety, then any such cash severance payments shall be held and accumulated without interest, and shall be paid to you on the first Regular Payroll Date following the Release Effective Date. Your failure or refusal to sign and deliver the release or your revocation of an executed and delivered release in accordance with applicable laws, whether intentionally or unintentionally, will result in the forfeiture of the payments and benefits under paragraph 7(b)(ii) or 7(c)(ii), as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the sixty (60) day period does not begin and end in the same calendar year, then the Release Effective Date shall occur no earlier than January 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which your termination occurs.
st
(ii)
          
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the payments and benefits described in paragraph 7(b)(ii) or 7(c)(ii), as applicable, shall immediately cease, and CBS shall have no further obligations to you with respect thereto, in the event that you materially breach any provision of paragraph 6 hereof.

The reductions shall first be made to amounts which do not constitute "deferred compensation" within the meaning of Code Section 409A, and thereafter from amounts specified in paragraph 7(b)(ii)(A) or 7(c)(ii)(A), as applicable, but without changing the regularly scheduled payment dates for any such amounts.
