The Registration Statement, as of the most recent effective date, did not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

The Prospectus, as of its date, and at the Closing Time and as of any Settlement Time, will comply, in all material respects, with the applicable provisions of the 1933 Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; , , that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to the information contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company in writing by NAI or the Selling Stockholder or by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representative or NAI specifically for use in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by or on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in Section 6(b) hereof.

Shares
.
     (ii) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, NAI hereby grants an option to the several Underwriters to purchase, severally and not jointly, and to cause the Selling Stockholder to sell, up to the number of Option Shares set forth in Schedule 1 hereto at the same purchase price per share as the Underwriters shall pay for the Firm Shares. Said option may be exercised only to cover over-allotments in the sale of the Firm Shares by the Underwriters. Said option may be exercised in whole or in part at any time on or before the 30th day after the date of the Prospectus upon written or telegraphic notice by the Representatives to the Company and the Selling Stockholder setting forth the number of Option Shares as to which the several Underwriters are exercising the option and any Settlement Time. The number of Option Shares to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be the same percentage of the total number of Option Shares to be purchased by the several Underwriters as such Underwriter is purchasing of the Firm Shares, subject to such adjustments as you in your absolute discretion shall make to eliminate any fractional shares.
     (b) Payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of, the Firm Shares shall be made at the offices of Shearman & Sterling LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by the Representative and the Company, at 10:00 A.M. (Eastern time) on October 20, 2009 (unless postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10), or such other time not later than ten business days after such date as shall be agreed upon by the Representative, the Company and NAI (such time and date of payment and delivery being herein called the "Closing Time").
Payment
.
 
     If the option provided for in Section 2(a)(ii) hereof shall have been exercised on or before the third Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Time, payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of, the Option Shares shall be made at the offices of Shearman & Sterling LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by the Representative, the Company and NAI, at the Closing Time.
     If the option provided for in Section 2(a)(ii) hereof is exercised after the third Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Time, payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of, the Option Shares shall be made at the offices of Shearman & Sterling LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by the Representative, the Company and NAI, at 10:00 A.M. (Eastern time) on the date specified by the Representative (which shall be within three Business Days after exercise of said option).
     The time and date of payment of the purchase price for, and delivery of, the Option Shares is herein called the "Settlement Time."
     Payment shall be made to NAI by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by NAI (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may be an account of the Selling Stockholder), against delivery to the Representative for the respective accounts of the Underwriters of the Shares to be purchased by them. It is understood that each Underwriter has authorized the Representative, for its account, to accept delivery of, receipt for, and make payment of the purchase price for, the Shares which it has severally agreed to purchase. The Representative, individually and not as representative of the Underwriters, may (but shall not be obligated to) make payment of the purchase price for the Shares to be purchased by any Underwriter whose funds have not been received by the Closing Time, but such payment shall not relieve such Underwriter from its obligations hereunder. Delivery of the Shares shall be made through the facilities of the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), Clearstream Luxembourg Banking, socit anonyme, or Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System, unless the Representative shall otherwise instruct.
     NAI will pay all applicable state transfer taxes, if any, involved in the transfer to the several Underwriters of the Shares to be purchased by them from the Selling Stockholder and the respective Underwriters will pay any additional stock transfer taxes involved in further transfers of such Shares by them.
     (c) . Each Underwriter agrees that it will not offer, sell or deliver any of the Shares, directly or indirectly, or distribute the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other offering material relating to the Shares, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances which will not impose any obligations on the Company or the Selling Stockholder except as set forth in this Underwriting Agreement.
Selling Restrictions
     (d) . (i) The Company represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Representative, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Shares that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act; (ii) each Underwriter represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the
Free Writing Prospectuses
 
Company, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Shares that would constitute a free writing prospectus required to be filed by the Company with the Commission; (iii) any such free writing prospectus, the use and content of which have been consented to by the Company and the Representative is listed on Schedule 3 hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company and NAI consent to the use by any Underwriter of a free writing prospectus that contains only (A)(i) information describing only the preliminary terms of the offering and that is included in Schedule 2 hereto, or (B) other information that is not "issuer information," as defined in Rule 433 under the 1933 Act.
     3. .
Covenants

Covenants of the Company

The Company will promptly effect the filings necessary pursuant to Rule 424 and will take such steps as it deems necessary to ascertain promptly whether the Prospectus transmitted for filing under Rule 424 was received for filing by the Commission and, in the event that it was not, it will promptly file the Prospectus. The Company will make every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any stop order and, if any stop order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.
Compliance with Securities Regulations and Commission Requests
.
     (b) .

Contribution
     The relative benefits received by the Company and NAI, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Shares under this Underwriting Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of such Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Stockholder bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.
     The relative fault of the Company and NAI, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, NAI or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     The Company, NAI and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 7.
     Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, (i) NAI shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount equal to the proceeds (after deducting Underwriters' discounts but before expenses) received by NAI and/or the Selling Stockholder from the sale of the Shares by it under this Agreement, and (ii) no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.
     No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
     For purposes of this Section 7, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act and each director,
 
officer and affiliate of each Underwriter, shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of Shares set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule 1 hereto, and not joint.
