Item 5.02   Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of
                   Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e)       On February 3, 2011, CBS Corporation (CBS or the Company) entered into an amended and restated employment agreement (the Agreement) with Joseph R. Ianniello, the Companys Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, which amends the good reason definition to clarify the effect if certain material reductions in Mr. Ianniellos position and responsibilities were to take place and provides enhanced severance payments and benefits (Enhanced Severance) in the event of Mr. Ianniellos termination without cause or for good reason within 24 months of certain events set forth in the Agreement.  Subject to Mr. Ianniellos delivery of a general release in form satisfactory to CBS and his continued compliance with non-compete obligations and other restrictive covenants for specified periods, the Enhanced Severance provides an amount equal to three times the sum of Mr. Ianniellos salary and the average of his actual bonus awards for the preceding three years, and certain health and insurance benefits for 36 months.  In addition, if any Enhanced Severance payable to Mr. Ianniello would be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company has agreed to pay him, under certain defined circumstances and subject to certain limitations, an additional amount that places him in the same after tax economic position had the Enhanced Severance not been subject to the excise tax.
The foregoing description of the terms of Mr. Ianniellos amended and restated employment agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, dated February 3, 2011, between CBS Corporation and Joseph R. Ianniello, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10 and is incorporated herein by reference.
