Exhibit 99
New York, New York, February 16, 2011  CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS.A and CBS) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2010.
 
"CBS's exceptional fourth quarter results capped an extraordinary year for the Company," said Sumner Redstone, Executive Chairman, CBS Corporation.  "Our strategy of producing and distributing the best content is proving to be highly successful in a multi-platform world.  Given our very talented management team, and our pipeline and library of industry-leading content that just keeps getting better, CBS is poised for continued success well into the future."
 
"CBS's momentum accelerated throughout 2010, culminating in our best results of the year in the fourth quarter," said Leslie Moonves, President and Chief Executive Officer, CBS Corporation.  "Every one of our operating groups achieved solid quarterly revenue growth, and double-digit OIBDA growth.  On the television network, in domestic and international syndication, on cable and on new and emerging platforms, our content continues to outperform, and we're increasingly being paid a premium for it as a result.  The ongoing resurgence of our local businesses also had a very positive effect on the quarter.  We see these positive trends  throughout our businesses  continuing into the first quarter of 2011, with robust network scatter and very strong local ad pacing.  At the same time, we have maintained our strict discipl ine on controlling costs and taken significant steps to further strengthen our balance sheet and enhance shareholder value, including our $1.5 billion share buyback program, which we began implementing last month.  Between the strength of our content, the way we've positioned our Company for future growth and the ongoing improvement in the economic environment, we expect great things this year and beyond."

Every one of the Company's segments delivered double-digit adjusted OIBDA growth as well as margin expansion during the quarter.  This growth was driven by the increase in revenues, partially offset by increased investment in content in the Entertainment segment.  The adjusted OIBDA margin of 20% for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased three percentage points from the same prior-year period.  Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter increased 45% to $631.3 million from $435.0 million for the same quarter last year.

Adjusted results for the fourth quarter of 2010 exclude restructuring charges of $14.6 million and a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $43.5 million.  Adjusted results for the fourth quarter of 2009 exclude pre-tax non-cash impairment charges totaling $186.0 million, restructuring charges of $13.2 million and a net benefit from discrete tax items of $1.3 million.

Reconciliations of all non-GAAP measures to reported results are included at the end of this earnings release.
 
Reported OIBDA for the fourth quarter of 2010 increased 93% to $755.5 million from $390.9 million for the same quarter last year, and reported operating income increased 153% to $616.7 million from $243.5 million.

Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $39.9 million versus $295.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2009.  The Company made fourth quarter discretionary contributions of $167.0 million and $20.0 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, to pre-fund its qualified pension plans.

Affiliate and subscription fees were up 9%.  Content licensing and distribution revenues declined 2% reflecting lower domestic syndication sales from the absence of the first-cycle sales of five major titles in 2009, partially offset by higher international syndication sales and the addition of theatrical revenues in 2010.
Super Bowl XLIV
 
Adjusted OIBDA for 2010 was $2.37 billion, up 32% from $1.80 billion for 2009, driven by the aforementioned growth in advertising revenues and affiliate and subscription fees, partially offset by lower domestic syndication sales, increased investment in content and higher sports programming costs, largely attributable to .  The adjusted OIBDA margin of 17% for 2010 increased three percentage points from 2009, driven by significant improvement in Local Broadcasting, Outdoor and Cable Networks.  Adjusted operating income for 2010 increased 49% to $1.81 billion from $1.22 billion for 2009.
Super Bowl XLIV
 
Adjusted net earnings of $772.7 million for 2010 increased 107% from $374.0 million for 2009, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.11, up from $.55.

Reported OIBDA for 2010 increased 49% to $2.38 billion from $1.59 billion for 2009 and reported operating income increased 80% to $1.82 billion from $1.01 billion.  Reported net earnings of $724.2 million for 2010 increased $497.7 million from net earnings of $226.5 million for 2009, and reported net earnings per diluted share were $1.04, up from $.33.
 
 
Free cash flow for 2010 increased 75% to $1.45 billion from $827.8 million for 2009, largely as a result of higher revenues from advertising and affiliate and subscription fees.  The increase was partially offset by higher discretionary contributions in 2010 to pre-fund the Company's qualified pension plans as well as higher cash taxes.
 
Balance Sheet and Liquidity
At December 31, 2010, the Company's cash balance was $480.0 million, a decrease of $236.7 million from $716.7 million at December 31, 2009.

Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) Before Depreciation and Amortization and Adjusted Operating Income (Loss)
 
The following tables set forth the Company's adjusted Operating Income (Loss) Before Depreciation and Amortization ("OIBDA") and adjusted Operating Income (Loss) for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.  The Company defines OIBDA as net earnings (loss) adjusted to exclude the following line items presented in its Consolidated Statements of Operations: Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax; Provision for income taxes; Other items, net; Loss on early extinguishment of debt; Interest income; Interest expense; and Depreciation and amortization. The Company defines "Adjusted OIBDA" as OIBDA before impairment and restructuring charges, and the settlements of certain disputes regarding previously disposed businesses and "Adjusted Operating Income" as Operating Income (Loss) before impairment and restructuring charges, and settlements of c ertain disputes regarding previously disposed businesses.
 
The Company uses Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted Operating Income, as well as Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted Operating Income margins, among other things, to evaluate the Company's operating performance, to value prospective acquisitions and as one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel, and these measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods.  These measures are important indicators of the Company's operational strength and performance of its business because they provide a link between profitability and operating cash flow.  The Company believes the presentation of these measures is relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company's management, help improve their ability to understand the Company& #146;s operating performance and make it easier to compare the Company's results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates.  In addition, these measures are among the primary measures used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry.
 
Since Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted Operating Income are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net earnings (loss) as an indicator of operating performance.  OIBDA, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  In addition, this measure does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use, and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs.  As Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted Operating Income exclude certain financial information compared with net earnings (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are exclu ded.  The Company provides the following reconciliations of Adjusted OIBDA to net earnings (loss) and Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted Operating Income for each segment to such segment's operating income (loss), the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.

Free Cash Flow
 
Free cash flow reflects the Company's net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program and less capital expenditures.  The Company's net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
 
The Company's calculation of free cash flow for 2009 does not include increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program because the Company does not consider the cash flow from this program to be indicative of the cash generated by the underlying operating performance of the Company.  Accordingly, the Company considers its decision to increase or decrease its accounts receivable securitization program a financing decision.  In 2010, as a result of the adoption of amended Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets, increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program are reflected as financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  Under the previous guidance these changes were reflected as operating activities.  Also, the Company's calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures since investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company's operations.
 
Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs.  As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company's ability to generate long-term value.  It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company's operating performance.  The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company's underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management.  Free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain manageme nt personnel.  In addition, free cash flow is also a primary measure used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry.
As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance.  Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, and does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs.
