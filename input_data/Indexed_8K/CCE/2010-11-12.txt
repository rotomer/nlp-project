Trustee
In furnishing this opinion, I have examined the Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (No. 333-170322) of the Company, relating to an indeterminate principal amount of debt securities, debt warrants and currency warrants, (the "") and such corporate and other records as I have deemed necessary or appropriate to provide a basis for the opinion set forth below. In such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as original documents, the conformity with the original documents of all documents submitted to me as copies, the due authorization, execution and delivery of all such documents where due authorization, execution and delivery is a prerequisite to the effectiveness of such documents, and the authority of the person or persons who executed each of such documents on behalf of any person or entity other than the Company and that each of the documents that is an agreement or obligation is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each party thereto, other than the Company, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms. With respect to certain matters of fact, I have relied upon certificates of officers and representatives of the Company and of public officials.
Registration Statement
With regard to the opinion set forth below, I have relied solely upon an opinion letter dated November 12, 2010 from Shearman & Sterling LLP, New York, New York, with respect to all matters of New York law related thereto.
This opinion is based upon pertinent laws and facts in existence as of the date hereof, and I expressly disclaim any obligation to advise you of changes to such pertinent laws or facts that hereafter may come to my attention.
Based on the foregoing and having due regard for such legal considerations as I deem relevant, I am of the opinion that:
(i) The Indenture constitutes a valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms; and
 
(ii) The Notes have been duly executed by the Company and, when authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the underwriters as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company, in accordance with their terms, and will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
The opinions set forth above are subject to the qualification that the enforcement of the Notes and Indenture may be limited by the following:
(a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally (including without limitation all laws relating to fraudulent transfers); and
(b) general equity principles, including without limitation concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).
In connection with the foregoing opinion, I wish to point out that I am a member of the Bar of the State of Georgia and I do not hold myself out as an expert in the laws of states other than Georgia. However, I have made, or caused to be made, such investigation as I have deemed appropriate with respect to the laws of other states in connection with such opinion, and nothing has come to my attention in the course of such investigation which would lead me to question the correctness of such opinion.
I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, and I hereby consent to the reference made to me under the heading "Legal Matters" set forth in the prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement. In giving such consent, I do not thereby admit that I am in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
 
 

 
Exhibit 8.1

To the Persons listed in Schedule A
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special tax counsel to Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with Registration Statement No. 333-170322 (the "Registration Statement") and the filing pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), by the Company of a Prospectus Supplement dated November 8, 2010, to the Prospectus dated November 8, 2010 (including the documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, collectively the "Prospectus Supplement"), with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), relating to the issuance of $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 1.125% Notes due 2013 (the "Notes") to be issued under the Indenture, dated as of September 14, 2010 (the "Indenture"), between International CCE Inc. (subsequently renamed Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.) and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the "Trustee"), which are to be placed by you as underwriters (the "Underwriters") pursuant to the Terms Agreement dated November 8, 2010 among the Company and you, which incorporates the underwriting agreement dated November 8, 2010 (collectively, the "Underwriting Agreement").
In connection with this opinion, we have examined and relied upon originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of (i) the Prospectus Supplement, (ii) the Underwriting Agreement, (iii) the Indenture and (iv) such other documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein. We have also relied upon statements and representations made to us by representatives of the Company. For purposes of this opinion, we have assumed the validity and the initial and continuing accuracy of the documents, certificates, records, statements and representations referred to above.
In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic, facsimile or electronic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents. In making our examination of documents executed, or to be executed, by the parties indicated
therein, we have assumed that each party has, or will have, the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform all obligations thereunder, and we have also assumed the due authorization by all requisite action, corporate or other, and execution and delivery by each party indicated in the documents and that such documents constitute, or will constitute, valid and binding obligations of each party. Where documents have been provided to us in draft form, we have assumed that the final executed versions of such documents will not differ materially from such drafts.
In rendering our opinion, we have considered the current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury Department regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial authorities, interpretive rulings of the Internal Revenue Service and such other authorities as we have considered relevant, all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis. There can be no assurance that any of the opinions expressed herein will be accepted by the Internal Revenue Service or, if challenged, by a court. Moreover, a change in the authorities or the accuracy or completeness of any of the information, documents, certificates, records, statements, representations, covenants or assumptions on which our opinion is based could affect our conclusions.
Based upon the foregoing and in reliance thereon, we hereby confirm that the statements in the discussion set forth in the Disclosure Package (as defined in Section 1(e) of the Underwriting Agreement) and the Prospectus Supplement each under the caption "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations," insofar as such statements constitute summaries of the legal matters referred to therein, fairly present the information called for with respect to such legal matters in all material respects, and fairly summarize the matters referred to therein in all material respects.
This opinion is being furnished pursuant to Section 4(b)(3) of the Underwriting Agreement. This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal developments, any factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof, or any information, document, certificate, record, statement, representation, covenant or assumption relied upon herein that becomes incorrect or untrue.
Except as set forth above, we express no opinion to any party as to the tax consequences, whether federal, state, local or foreign, of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or of any transaction related to or contemplated thereby. This opinion is furnished to you solely in connection with the Underwriting Agreement and is not to be relied upon by any other person without our express written permission.
