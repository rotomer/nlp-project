The Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. Legacy Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "CCE Legacy Plan"), was established for the purpose of replacing the equity awards previously granted by the former Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. to individuals who became employees of our company on October 2, 2010. On December 14, 2010, the Company's board of directors approved the amendment to the CCE Legacy Plan to reduce the number of shares of the Company's stock authorized for issuance under the plan from 22,000,000 to 14,000,000 shares. The Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. Legacy Plan (As Amended and Restated Effective December 14, 2010) is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(""), International CCE, Inc., The Coca-Cola Company and Cobalt Subsidiary LLC, pursuant to which Former CCE was merged with and into Cobalt Subsidiary LLC, which is wholly-owned by The Coca-Cola Company (the "") and whereby International CCE Inc. ("" or the "") along with Former CCE's subsidiaries outside of the United States, Canada, the British Virgin Islands, the United States Virgin Islands and/or the Cayman Islands split-off from Former CCE to become a separate company, organized under the laws of the state of Delaware and whose shares of common stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (""). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, New CCE agreed that all awards of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units, performance stock units and any other share-based awards over shares of Former CCE's common stock granted to employees who are not North American Business Holders (as defined in Section 2.4(g)(i) of the Merger Agreement) under one or more of the plans listed in Section II of this Plan (collectively referred to as "") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.3 of the Merger Agreement) would be replaced with awards over shares of New CCE's common stock ("").

Exhibit A
Section 1. Purpose
The purpose of the 1997 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is to advance the interest of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (the "Company") and its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 4) by encouraging and enabling the acquisition of a financial interest in the Company by officers and other key employees through grants of stock options ("Options").
Section 2. Administration
The Plan shall be administered by a Compensation Committee (the "Committee") appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") from among its members and shall be comprised of not fewer than two members who shall be "nonemployee directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Internal Revenue Code"), and the regulations thereunder.
The Committee shall determine the persons to whom and the times at which Options will be granted, the number of shares to be subject to each Option, the duration of each Option, the times within which the Option may be exercised, the cancellation of the Option (with the consent of the holder thereof) and the other conditions of the grant of an Option. The Committee, however, may delegate, from time to time, to the Chief Executive Officer the authority to make Awards under the Plan or to extend the period for exercise of Options awarded under the Plan, unless such delegation would jeopardize the benefits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations thereunder. Conditions of the grants of Options need not be the same with respect to each optionee or with respect to each Option.
The Committee may, subject to the provisions of the Plan, establish such rules and regulations for the proper administration of the Plan, may make interpretations and take other action in relation to the Plan as it deems necessary or advisable. Each interpretation or other action made or taken pursuant to the Plan shall be final and conclusive for all purposes and upon all persons including, but without limitation, the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Committee, the Board, the affected optionees, and their respective successors in interest.
In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they have as directors or as members of the Committee, the members of the Committee shall be indemnified by the Company against reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any appeal, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken or failure to act in connection with the Plan or any Option granted hereunder, and against all amounts paid by them in settlement thereof (provided such settlement is approved to the extent required by and in the manner provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company relating to indemnification of directors) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, except in relation to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding that such Committee member or members did not act in good faith and in a manner he, she or they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Company.
Section 3. Stock
The stock to be issued under the Plan shall be shares of common stock, $1 par value, of the Company (the "Stock"). The Stock shall be made available from authorized and unissued Stock or from shares of Stock held by the Company in its treasury. The total number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan pursuant to Options granted hereunder shall not exceed 5,433,000. Stock subject to any unexercised portion of an Option which expires or is canceled, surrendered or terminated for any reason may again be subject to Options granted under the Plan. Stock received in payment upon the exercise of an Option may not be the subject of a subsequent Option.
Section 4. Eligibility
Options may be granted to executive officers, other persons in the senior executive band, and in the executive band, branch managers, sales center managers, and other officers and management employees (including non-employee officers) of the Company and its Subsidiaries. "Subsidiary" shall mean any corporation or other business organization in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the voting stock or capital at the time of the granting of such Option.
No person shall be granted the right to acquire pursuant to Options granted under the Plan more than 20% of the aggregate number of shares of Stock originally authorized for issuance under the Plan.
Section 5. Awards of Options
The option price shall be 100% or more of the fair market value of the Stock on the date of grant. The fair market value of shares of Stock shall be computed on the basis of the average of the high and low market prices at which a share of Stock shall have been sold on the date for which the valuation is made, or on the next preceding trading day if such date was not a trading day, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions listing, or as otherwise determined by the Committee.
(a) Option Price.
The option price shall be paid in full at the time of exercise. No shares shall be issued until full payment has been received therefor. Payment may be made in cash or, with the prior approval of and upon the conditions established by the Committee, by other means, including delivery of shares of Stock owned by the optionee.
(b) Payment.
Subject to the provisions of Section 9 and the terms of the Option, the duration of Options shall be 10 years from date of grant.
(c) Duration of Options.
Subject to the provisions of Section 9 and terms of the Option, an Option shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, within such time periods as established on the date of grant by the Committee, or, when applicable, the Chief Executive Officer.
(d) Time Period for Exercise of Option.
Options may contain such other provisions, as the Committee shall determine appropriate from time to time. The grant of an Option to any officer or employee shall not affect in any way the right of the Company and any Subsidiary to terminate the relationship between the Company or Subsidiary and the optionee.
(e) Other Terms and Conditions.
Options granted to an optionee who is subject to the laws of a country other than the United States of America may contain terms and conditions inconsistent with provisions of the Plan (except those necessary to retain the benefits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code), or may be granted under such supplemental documents, as required under such laws.
(f) Options Granted to International Optionees.
The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the optionee the amount of any federal, state or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to the Stock subject to such Award.
(g) Withholding.
Section 6. Replacement
The Committee from time to time may permit an optionee under the Plan to surrender for cancellation any unexercised outstanding stock option or stock appreciation rights of the Company and receive in exchange from the Company either shares of Stock, an option for such number of shares of Stock, or both, in amounts and with features as designated by the Committee.
Section 7. Extension of the Terms of Options
The Committee may extend the duration of any Option for a period not to exceed one year without changing the option price and on such other terms and conditions as the Committee may deem advisable unless such extension or change would result in less favorable tax treatment than the optionee would have received under the original option.
Section 8. Nontransferability of Option
An Option granted pursuant to the Plan shall not be transferable otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, unless otherwise determined by the Committee. Certificate(s) representing the shares of Stock issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued only in the name of the optionee or in the name of such optionee's duly authorized representative. With the exception of any Option transferred pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, Options shall be exercisable, during the lifetime of an optionee, only by the optionee personally or by the optionee's legal representative. With respect to any Option transferred pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, any such Option shall be exercisable only by the designated transferee personally or the designated transferee's legal representative.
Section 9. Effect of Termination of Employment
(a) Retirement and Disability.
The Committee, in its sole discretion, may cause all outstanding Options held by an optionee upon his or her retirement or disability to become immediately exercisable.
(i)
All Options exercisable upon retirement or disability of an optionee (whether due to Committee action or otherwise) or becoming exercisable thereafter shall expire no later than 36 months from the date of such optionee's retirement or disability; provided, however, that if the optionee dies within two years after the optionee's retirement or disability, the Options shall expire 12 months after his or her death, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
(ii)
(b) Death While Employed.
Upon the death of an optionee prior to termination of employment, all outstanding Options held by such employee expire no later than 12 months after the employee's death, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
(c) Other Termination of Employment.
Upon the termination of employment of an optionee other than the death, disability or retirement of the optionee ("Other Termination of Employment"), then the Committee, in its sole discretion, may cause all outstanding nonexercisable Options held by such optionee to become immediately exercisable.
(i)
All Options exercisable upon the Other Termination of Employment (whether due to Committee action or otherwise) or becoming exercisable thereafter, shall expire no later than six months after the Other Termination of Employment, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
(ii)
(d) Definitions and other Determinations.
For purposes of this Section 9, "retirement" means an optionee's voluntary termination of employment on a date which is on or after the earliest date on which such optionee would be eligible for an immediately payable benefit pursuant to the terms of the defined benefit pension plan sponsored by the Company or a Subsidiary in which the optionee participates. If the optionee does not participate in such a plan, the date shall be determined as if the optionee participated in the Company's defined benefit plan covering the majority of its nonbargaining employees in the United States. With respect to nonemployee officers, "retirement" means termination
(i)
of services as an officer at or after age 55. Notwithstanding the foregoing, options may contain such other definitions of "retirement," as the Committee determines appropriate.
For purposes of this Section 9, "disability" shall be determined according to the definition of "disability," in effect at the time of the determination, in the defined benefit pension plan sponsored by the Company or a Subsidiary in which the optionee participates. If the optionee does not participate in such a plan, the definition shall be determined as if the optionee participated in the Company's defined benefit plan covering the majority of its nonbargaining employees in the United States.
(ii)
For purposes of this Section 9, an optionee's employment shall not be deemed to have terminated if the optionee obtains immediate employment with certain affiliates of the Company, as defined in an Option, and termination from such subsequent employment shall be deemed a termination from the Company, unless the optionee obtains immediate reemployment with the Company or its Subsidiaries.
(iii)
Section 10. No Rights as a Share Owner
An Optionee or a transferee of an Option shall have no right as a share owner with respect to any Stock covered by an Option or receivable upon the exercise of an Option until the optionee or transferee shall have become the holder of record of such Stock. No adjustments shall be made for dividends in cash or other property (except for share dividends) or other distributions or rights in respect of such Stock for which the record date is prior to the date on which the optionee or transferee shall have in fact become the holder of record of the share of Stock acquired pursuant to the Option.
Section 11. Adjustment in the Number of Shares and in Option Price
In the event there is any change in the shares of Stock through the declaration of stock dividends or stock splits or through recapitalization or merger, share exchange, consolidation, combination of shares or otherwise, the Committee or the Board shall make such adjustment, if any, as it may deem appropriate in the number of shares of Stock available for Options as well as the number of shares of Stock subject to any outstanding Option and the option price thereof. Any such adjustment may provide for the elimination of any fractional shares which might otherwise become subject to any Option without payment therefor.
Section 12. Amendments, Modification and Termination of the Plan
The Board or the Committee may terminate the Plan in whole or in part, may suspend the Plan in whole or in part from time to time, and may amend the Plan from time to time, including the adoption of amendments deemed necessary or desirable to qualify the Options under the laws of various states (including tax laws) or to correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Option granted thereunder, without the approval of the share owners of the Company. However, no action shall be taken without the approval of the share owners of the Company if the Committee determines that the approval of share owners would be necessary to retain the benefits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
No amendment or termination or modification of the Plan shall in any manner affect any Option theretofore granted without the consent of the optionee, except that the Committee may amend or modify the Plan in a manner that does affect Options theretofore granted upon a finding by the Committee that such amendment or modification is necessary to retain the benefits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code or that it is not adverse to the interest of holders of outstanding Options. The Plan shall terminate five years after the date of approval of the Plan by the share owners of the Company unless earlier terminated by the Board or by the Committee.
Section 13. Governing Law
The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant thereto shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia and construed in accordance therewith.
Section 1. Purpose
The purpose of the 1997 Stock Option Plan for French Employees (the "Plan") is to advance the interest of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (the "Company") and its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 4) located in France by encouraging and enabling the acquisition of a financial interest in the Company by officers and other key employees through grants of stock options ("Options").
Section 2. Administration
The Plan shall be administered by a Compensation Committee (the "Committee") appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") from among its members and shall be comprised of not fewer than two members who shall be "nonemployee directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
The Committee shall determine the persons to whom and the times at which Options will be granted, the number of shares to be subject to each Option, the duration of each Option, the times within which the Option may be exercised, the cancellation of the Option (with the consent of the holder thereof) and the other conditions of the grant of an Option. The Committee, however, may delegate, from time to time, to the Chief Executive Officer the authority to make Awards under the Plan or to extend the period for exercise of Options awarded under the Plan. The conditions of the grants of Options need not be the same with respect to each optionee or with respect to each Option.
The Committee may, subject to the provisions of the Plan, establish such rules and regulations for the proper administration of the Plan, may make interpretations and take other action in relation to the Plan as it deems necessary or advisable. Each interpretation or other action made or taken pursuant to the Plan shall be final and conclusive for all purposes and upon all persons including, but without limitation, the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Committee, the Board, the affected optionees, and their respective successors in interest.

The stock to be issued under the Plan shall be shares of common stock, $1 par value, of the Company (the "Stock"). The Stock shall be made available only from authorized and unissued Stock.

Section 4. Eligibility
Options may be granted to officers and management employees employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries in France. No options may be granted to non-employee directors or to any person who would not be eligible under French company law (Section L.208 of the law of July 24, 1966). More generally, no option may be granted to an optionee who already owns more than 10% of the Company's share capital. "Subsidiary" shall mean any corporation or other business organization in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the voting stock or capital at the time of the granting of such Option.
Section 5. Awards of Options
The exercise price of each option shall be determined in relation to the fair market value of the Stock on a date specified by the Committee, or if applicable, the Chief Executive Officer. The fair market value of the Stock shall be computed on the basis of the average of the high and low market prices at which a share of Stock shall
(a) Option Price.
have been sold on the date of grant, or on the next preceding trading day if such date was not a trading day, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions listing. In no event, however, shall the exercise price of the Option be less than 80% of the average of the daily market prices over the twenty trading days preceding the date of grant, with the daily market price determined as the average of the high and low price at which the Stock was sold on each such trading day.
The date of grant shall be determined in accordance with French laws and regulations.
(b) Grant Date.
The option price shall be paid in full at the time of exercise. No shares shall be issued until full payment has been received therefor. Payment may be made in cash or, with the prior approval of and upon the conditions established by the Committee, by other means, including delivery of shares of Stock owned by the optionee.
(c) Payment.

(f) Other Terms and Conditions.
() . The grant of an Option to any officer or employee shall not affect in any way the right of the Company and any Subsidiary to terminate the relationship between the Company and the optionee.
g
No Affect on Employment Status
Section 6. Nontransferability of Option
No Option granted pursuant to the Plan shall be transferable except than by will or, in the absence of a will, by the laws of descent upon, and within six months of, the death of an optionee. Certificate(s) representing the shares of Stock issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued only in the name of the optionee or, provided such Option is exercised within six months of the optionee's death, in the name of his or her heir.
Section 7. No Rights as a Share Owner
An optionee shall have no right as a share owner with respect to any Stock covered by an Option or receivable upon the exercise of an Option until the optionee shall have become the holder of record of such Stock. No adjustments shall be made for dividends in cash or other property (except for share dividends) or other distributions or rights in respect of such Stock for which the record date is prior to the date on which the optionee shall have in fact become the holder of record of the share of Stock acquired pursuant to the Option.
Section 8. Adjustment in the Number of Shares and in Option Price
In the event there is any change in the shares of Stock through the declaration of stock dividends or stock splits or through recapitalization or merger, share exchange, consolidation, combination of shares or otherwise, the Committee or the Board shall make such adjustment, if any, as it may deem appropriate in the number of shares of Stock available for Options as well as the number of shares of Stock subject to any outstanding Option and the option price thereof. Any such adjustment may provide for the elimination of any fractional shares which might otherwise become subject to any Option without payment therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, adjustments in Options may only be made in accordance with French laws and regulations.
Section 9. Amendments, Modification and Termination of the Plan
The Board or the Committee may terminate the Plan in whole or in part, may suspend the Plan in whole or in part from time to time, and may amend the Plan from time to time, including the adoption of amendments deemed necessary or desirable to qualify the Options under laws of France or the United States (including tax laws) or to correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Option granted thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment of the Plan, or of the terms of any Option granted hereunder, shall be effective with respect to an optionee (i) without the consent of such optionee or (ii) if such amendment would constitute a cancellation of an existing Option and the grant of a new Option under French law.
The Plan shall terminate five years after the effective date of the Plan unless earlier terminated by the Board or by the Committee.
Section 10. Governing Law
The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant thereto shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, United States of America, and construed in accordance therewith.
 
In this Subplan:
 
 
The Company has established the 1997 Stock Option Plan (the Plan) and under that plan the Committee can establish such rules and regulations as it deems necessary and advisable for the proper administration of the Plan. Under those powers the Committee has established this Subplan with the intention that it be approved by the UK Inland Revenue under the provisions of Schedule 9 of the Taxes Act. Where the Committee wishes to grant stock options to acquire shares of stocks to employees of the Company's UK subsidiaries, such options may be granted subject to and in
accordance with the rules of this Subplan rather than under the rules of the Plan. This will not preclude the Committee also granting other options to an employee under the provisions of the Plan.
Options granted under this Subplan shall be referred to as Approved Options which will not include or in any way be linked with awards under the Plan which are excluded from this Subplan. In particular, Section 6 (replacement) and Section 7 (Extension of the Terms of Options) of the Plan shall not apply to Approved Options granted under this Subplan.
In all cases of grants of Approved Options to employees of the Company's UK subsidiaries, the rules of this Subplan shall be strictly observed. For the purposes of the Plan, the rules of the Subplan shall be incorporated into and made part of the Administrative Procedure for Stock Option Grants insofar as grants of Approved Options to employees of the Company's UK subsidiaries are concerned.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Options granted under this Subplan shall not be assigned, pledged or otherwise transferred except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and during the lifetime of an Option Holder the option shall be exercised only by such an Option Holder or the option Holder's guardian or legal representative.
 
In the event of any capitalization or rights issue or any consolidation, sub-division or reduction of capital by the Company, the number of shares of stock subject to any Approved Option and the option price (as defined in Rule 7) for each of those shares of Stock shall be adjusted in such manner as the Auditors, after consultation with the Committee, confirm to be fair and reasonable provided that:
 
 
 
 
 
The Committee may not make any amendment to this Subplan or to the form of words used in the UK Approved Stock Option Subplan Grant Agreement without first obtaining the approval of the Board of Inland Revenue.
Exhibit B
Section 1. Purpose
The purpose of the 1999 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") is to advance the interest of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (the "Company") and its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 4) by encouraging and enabling the acquisition of a financial interest in the Company by officers and other key employees through grants of stock options ("Options").
Section 2. Administration
The Plan shall be administered by a Compensation Committee (the "Committee") appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") from among its members and shall be comprised of not fewer than two members who shall be "nonemployee directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Internal Revenue Code"), and the regulations thereunder.
The Committee shall determine the persons to whom and the times at which Options will be granted, the number of shares to be subject to each Option, the duration of each Option, the times within which the Option may be exercised, the cancellation of the Option (with the consent of the holder thereof) and the other conditions of the grant of an Option. The Committee, however, may delegate to the Chief Executive Officer the authority to make awards under the Plan, to extend the period for exercise of Options awarded or to make such other determinations that the Committee is authorized to make under the Plan, unless such delegation would jeopardize the benefits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code or Rule 16b-3 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.
The Committee may, subject to the provisions of the Plan, establish such rules and regulations for the proper administration of the Plan, may make interpretations and take other action in relation to the Plan as it deems necessary or advisable. Each interpretation or other action made or taken pursuant to the Plan shall be final and conclusive for all purposes and upon all persons including, but without limitation, the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Committee, the Board, the affected optionees, and their respective successors in interest.
In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they have as directors or as members of the Committee, the members of the Committee shall be indemnified by the Company against reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any appeal, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken or failure to act in connection with the Plan or any Option granted hereunder, and against all amounts paid by them in settlement thereof (provided such settlement is approved to the extent required by and in the manner provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company relating to indemnification of directors) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, except in relation to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding that such Committee member or members did not act in good faith and in a manner he, she or they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Company.
Section 3. Stock
The stock to be issued under the Plan shall be shares of common stock, $1 par value, of the Company (the "Stock"). The Stock shall be made available from authorized and unissued Stock or from shares of Stock held by the Company in its treasury. The total number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan pursuant to Options granted hereunder shall not exceed 20,000,000. Stock subject to any unexercised portion of an Option which expires or is canceled,
surrendered or terminated for any reason may again be subject to Options granted under the Plan. Stock received in payment upon the exercise of an Option may not be the subject of a subsequent Option.
Section 4. Eligibility
Options may be granted to executive officers, other persons in the senior executive band, and in the executive band, branch managers, sales center managers, other officers and management employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as well as a consultant or other person providing key services to the Company and its Subsidiaries. "Subsidiary" shall mean any corporation or other business organization in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the voting stock or capital at the time of the granting of such Option.
No person shall be granted the right to acquire pursuant to Options granted under the Plan more than 20% of the aggregate number of shares of Stock originally authorized for issuance under the Plan.
Section 5. Awards of Options
The option price shall be 100% or more of the fair market value of the Stock on the date of grant. The fair market value of shares of Stock shall be computed on the basis of the average of the high and low market prices at which a share of Stock shall have been sold on the date for which the valuation is made, or on the next preceding trading day if such date was not a trading day, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions listing, or as otherwise determined by the Committee.
(a) Option Price.
The option price shall be paid in full at the time of exercise. No shares shall be issued until full payment has been received therefor. Payment may be made in cash or, with the prior approval of and upon the conditions established by the Committee, by other means, including delivery of shares of Stock owned by the optionee.
(b) Payment.
Subject to the terms of the Option, the duration of Options shall be 10 years from date of grant.
(c) Duration of Options.
Options may contain such other provisions, as the Committee shall determine appropriate from time to time, including provisions related to the vesting of Options and the time periods within which an Option shall be exercisable. The grant of an Option to any officer or employee shall not affect in any way the right of the Company and any Subsidiary to terminate the relationship between the Company or Subsidiary and the optionee.
(d) Other Terms and Conditions.
Options granted to an optionee who is subject to the laws of a country other than the United States of America may contain terms and conditions inconsistent with provisions of the Plan (except those necessary to retain the benefits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), or may be granted under such supplemental documents, as required or appropriate under such country's laws.
(e) Options Granted to International Optionees.
The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the optionee the amount of any federal, state or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to Options granted hereunder or the Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of such Options.
(f) Withholding of Taxes.
Section 6. Replacement
The Committee from time to time may permit an optionee under the Plan to surrender for cancellation any unexercised outstanding stock option or stock appreciation rights of the Company and receive in exchange from the Company either shares of Stock, an option for such number of shares of Stock, or both, in amounts and with features as designated by the Committee.
Section 7. Extension of the Terms of Options
The Committee may extend the duration of any Option for a period not to exceed one year without changing the option price and on such other terms and conditions as the Committee may deem advisable unless such extension or change would result in less favorable tax treatment than the optionee would have received under the original option.
Section 8. Transferability of Options
An Option shall be transferable by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Further, an Option is transferable to an immediate family member of the optionee under such terms and conditions as may be determined, from time to time, by the Committee. For purposes of this Section 8, an "immediate family member" is defined as the optionee's spouse, child, grandchild, parent or a trust established for the benefit of such family members. With respect to any Option transferred pursuant to the terms of this Section 8, any such Option shall be exercisable only by the designated transferee or the designated transferee's legal representative.
Section 9. Effect of Termination of Employment
All Options exercisable upon an optionee's termination of employment (whether due to Committee action or otherwise) or becoming exercisable thereafter shall expire in accordance with the terms of such Options, unless the Committee determines otherwise. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may cause all outstanding Options held by an optionee upon his or her termination of employment for any reason, including retirement, death, and disability, to become immediately exercisable.
(a)
For purposes of this Section 9, "retirement" means an optionee's voluntary termination of employment on a date which is on or after the earliest date on which such optionee would be eligible for an immediately payable benefit pursuant to the terms of the defined benefit pension plan sponsored by the Company or a Subsidiary in which the optionee participates. If the optionee does not participate in such a plan, the date shall be determined as if the optionee participated in the Company's defined benefit plan covering the majority of its nonbargaining employees in the United States. With respect to nonemployee officers or consultants, "retirement" means termination, or cessation, of services at or after age 55. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may contain such other definitions of "retirement," as the Committee determines appropriate.
(b)
For purposes of this Section 9, "disability" shall have the same meaning as the definition "disability" in effect at the time of the determination in the defined benefit pension plan sponsored by the Company or a Subsidiary in which the optionee participates. If the optionee does not participate in such a plan or such plan does not define "disability," "disability" shall mean the optionee's inability, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to engage in any substantial gainful activity, which condition, in the opinion of a physician approved of by the Committee, is expected to have a duration of not less than one year.
(c)
Section 10. No Rights as a Share Owner
An optionee or a transferee of an Option shall have no right as a share owner with respect to any Stock covered by an Option or receivable upon the exercise of an Option until the optionee or transferee shall have become the holder of record of such Stock. No adjustments shall be made for dividends in cash or other property (except for stock dividends) or other distributions or rights in respect of such Stock for which the record date is prior to the date on which the optionee or transferee shall have in fact become the holder of record of the share of Stock acquired pursuant to the Option.
Section 11. Adjustment in the Number of Shares and in Option Price
In the event there is any change in the shares of Stock through the declaration of stock dividends or stock splits or through recapitalization or merger, share exchange, consolidation, combination of shares or otherwise, the Committee or the Board shall make such adjustment, if any, as it may deem appropriate in the number of shares of Stock available for Options as well as the number of shares of Stock subject to any outstanding Option and the option price thereof. Any such
adjustment may provide for the elimination of any fractional shares which might otherwise become subject to any Option without payment therefor.
Section 12. Amendments, Modification and Termination of the Plan
The Board or the Committee may terminate the Plan in whole or in part, may suspend the Plan in whole or in part from time to time, and may amend the Plan from time to time, including the adoption of amendments deemed necessary or desirable to qualify the Options under the laws of various states or countries (including tax laws) or to correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Option granted thereunder. Any such action may be taken without the approval of the share owners of the Company unless the Committee determines that the approval of share owners would be necessary to retain the benefits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
No amendment or termination or modification of the Plan shall in any manner affect any Option theretofore granted without the consent of the optionee, except that the Committee may amend or modify the Plan in a manner that does affect Options theretofore granted upon a finding by the Committee that such amendment or modification is necessary to retain the benefits of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code or that it is not adverse to the interest of holders of outstanding Options.
The Plan shall terminate five years after the date of approval of the Plan by the share owners of the Company unless earlier terminated by the Board or by the Committee.

Section 10. Governing Law
The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant thereto shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, United States of America, and construed in accordance therewith.
 
 
Words and expressions not defined in this Rule 1 have the same meaning as in Section 185 and Schedule 9 of the Taxes Act and any reference in this Subplan to any enactment includes a reference to that enactment as from time to time modified and extended.
 
The Company has established the Coca Cola Enterprises Inc 2002 Stock Option Plan (the Plan) and under that plan the Committee can establish such rules and regulations as it deems necessary and advisable for the proper administration of the Plan. Under those powers the Committee has established this Subplan with the intention that it be approved by the UK Inland Revenue under the provisions of Schedule 9 of the Taxes Act. Where the Committee wishes to grant stock options to acquire shares of stocks to employees of the Company's UK subsidiaries, such options may be granted subject to and in accordance with the rules of this Subplan rather than under the rules of the Plan. This will not preclude the Committee also granting other options to an employee under the provisions of the Plan.
Options granted under this Subplan shall be referred to as Approved Options which will not include or in any way be linked with awards under the Plan which are excluded from this Subplan. In particular, Section 6 (Extension of the Terms of Options) of the Plan shall not apply to Approved Options granted under this Subplan.
In all cases of grants of Approved Options to employees of the Company's UK subsidiaries, the rules of this Subplan shall be strictly observed. For the purposes of the Plan, the rules of the Subplan shall be incorporated into and made part of the Administrative Procedure for Stock Option Grants insofar as grants of Approved Options to employees of the Company's UK subsidiaries are concerned.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Approved Options granted under this Subplan shall not be assigned, pledged or otherwise transferred except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and during the lifetime of an Option Holder the option shall be exercised only by such an Option Holder or the option Holder's guardian or legal representative.
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the event of any capitalization or rights issue or any consolidation, sub-division or reduction of capital by the Company, the number of shares of stock subject to any Approved Option and the option price (as defined in Rule 7) for each of those shares of Stock shall be adjusted in such manner as the Auditors, after consultation with the Committee, confirm to be fair and reasonable provided that:
 
 
 
 
 
The Committee may not make any amendment to this Subplan or to the form of words used in the UK Approved Option agreement without first obtaining the approval of the Board of Inland Revenue.

Performance Conditions.
(b) If the Committee determines that a Performance Award to be granted to an Eligible Person who is or may become a Covered Employee should qualify as "performance-based compensation" for purposes of Code Section 162(m), the grant, exercise and/or settlement of such Performance Award shall be contingent upon achievement of pre-established performance goals and other terms set forth in this Section 8(b).

Business Criteria.

Accordingly, Sections 8(b), (c) and (d), shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Code Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder. If any provision of the Plan as in effect on the date of adoption or any agreements relating to Performance Awards that are designated as intended to comply with Code Section 162(m) does not comply or is inconsistent with the requirements of Code Section 162(m) or regulations thereunder, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements.

Beneficiaries and Transferees Subject to Terms of Award

The Committee is authorized to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards (including Performance Awards and performance goals related thereto) in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in the preceding sentence, as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets) affecting the Company, any Subsidiary or any business unit, or the financial statements of the Company or any Subsidiary, or in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations, accounting principles, tax rates and regulations or business conditions or in view of the Committee's assessment of the business strategy of the Company, any Subsidiary or business unit, performance of comparable organizations, economic and business conditions, personal performance of a Participant, and any other circumstances deemed relevant; provided that no such adjustment shall be authorized or made if and to the extent that such authority or the making of such adjustment would cause Performance Awards made under Section 8(b) to otherwise fail to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder.
(c) The Company and any Subsidiary is authorized to withhold from any Award granted, any payment relating to an Award under the Plan, including from a distribution of Stock, or any payroll or other payment to a Participant, amounts of withholding and other taxes due or potentially payable in connection with any transaction involving an Award, and to take such other action as the Committee may deem advisable to enable the Company and Participants to satisfy obligations for the payment of withholding taxes and other tax obligations relating to any Award. However, this authority shall not include withholding of taxes above the statutorily required withholding amounts where such excess withholding would result in an earnings charge to the Company under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such action may materially and adversely affect the rights of such Participant under any previously granted and outstanding Award, without the consent of an affected Participant. The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, or amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate any Award theretofore granted and any Award agreement relating thereto, except as otherwise provided in the Plan; provided that, without the consent of an affected Participant, no such Committee action may materially and adversely affect the rights of such Participant under such Award.

Unfunded Status of Awards; Creation of Trusts.
that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company; provided that the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts and deposit therein cash, Stock, other Awards or other property, or make other arrangements to meet the Company's obligations under the Plan. Such trusts or other arrangements shall be consistent with the "unfunded" status of the Plan unless the Committee otherwise determines with the consent of each affected Participant.

Code Section 409A
 
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Coca Cola Enterprises Inc. (the "Company") has established the 2004 Stock Award Plan (the "U.S. Plan") for the benefit of certain employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including its French subsidiary(ies) of which the Company holds directly or indirectly at least 10% of the share capital (the "French Entities").
Section 3(a) of the U.S. Plan specifically authorizes the Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee") to determine the terms and conditions of, and all other matters relating to, Awards (including deferred stock units granted in France) as the Committee deems appropriate and to make all other decisions and determinations with respect to the grant of Awards. The Committee has determined that it is appropriate to establish a sub-plan for the purposes of permitting Deferred Stock Units to qualify for favorable French tax and social security treatment. The Committee, therefore, intends to establish a sub-plan of the U.S. Plan for the purpose of granting deferred stock units which qualify for the favorable tax and social security treatment in France applicable to shares granted for no consideration under the Sections L. 225-197-1 to L. 225-197-5 of the French Commercial Code, as amended, to qualifying employees who are resident in France for French tax purposes (the "French Participants"). The terms of the U.S. Plan, as set out in Appendix 1 hereto, shall, subject to the following rules, constitute the Rules for Deferred Stock Units in France under the Coca Cola Enterprises Inc. 2004 Stock Award Plan (the "French DSU Plan").
Under the French DSU Plan, the qualifying employees will be granted only deferred stock units as defined in Section 2 hereunder. The grant of Deferred Stock Units is authorized under the Article 6(e) of the U.S. Plan. The provisions of Articles 6(b), (c) and (d) of the U.S. Plan permitting the grant of Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, and Restricted Stock are not applicable to grants made under this French DSU Plan.
 
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings as set forth in the U.S. Plan. The terms set out below will have the following meanings:
 
The term "Deferred Stock Units" shall mean a promise by the Company to a future issuance of a certain number of shares of Stock of the Company without any requirement to any payment, even of the par value of the shares of Stock, granted to the French Participants and subject to specific terms and conditions. Deferred Stock Units granted under this French DSU Plan shall be payable only in shares of Stock.
 
The term "Grant Date" shall be the date on which the Committee both (1) designates the French Participant and (2) specifies the terms and conditions of the Deferred Stock Units, including the number of shares of Stock to be issued at a future date following the lapse of restriction (on the Vesting Date as defined below), the conditions for the vesting of the Deferred Stock Units, the conditions for the issuance of the shares of Stock underlying the Deferred Stock Units by the Company, if any, and the conditions of the transferability of the shares of Stocks once issued.
 
The term "Vesting Date" shall mean the date on which the shares of Stock underlying the Deferred Stock Units are issued to the French Participant. In order to qualify for the French favorable tax and social security regime, such Vesting Date specified by the Committee shall not occur prior to the second anniversary of the Grant Date, as required by the vesting period applicable to French qualified restricted stock awards under Section L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code, as amended.
 
The term "Closed Period" means:
(i) Ten quotation days preceding and following the disclosure to the public of the consolidated financial statements or the annual statements of the Company;
(ii) The period as from the date the corporate management entities (involved in the governance of the company, such as the Board, Committee, supervisory directorate) of the Company have been disclosed information which could, if disclosed to the public, significantly impact the quotation of the Share of the Company, until ten quotation days after the day such information is disclosed to the public.
 
Subject to Section 3(c) below, any French Participant who, on the Grant Date of the Deferred Stock Units and to the extent required under French law, is either employed under the terms and conditions of an employment contract with a French Entity ("") or who is a corporate officer of a French Entity, shall be eligible to receive Deferred Stock Units under the French DSU Plan, provided that he or she also satisfies the eligibility conditions of Section 2(l) of the U.S. Plan.
(a)
contrat de travail
Deferred Stock Units may not be issued to corporate officers of the French Entities, other than the managing directors (, Prsident du Conseil d'Administration, Directeur Gnral, Directeur Gnral Dlgu, Membre du Directoire, Grant de Socits par actions), unless the corporate officer is an employee of a French Entity as defined by French law.
(b)
e.g.
Deferred Stock Units may not be issued under the French DSU Plan to employees or corporate officers owning more than ten percent (10%) of the Company's share capital or to individuals other than employees and corporate officers of the French Entities.
(c)
 
 
Since Shares of the Company are traded on a regulated market, Deferred Stock Units shall not be granted to French Participants in France during the Closed Period, to the extent such Closed Period are applicable to the Deferred Stock Units under French law.
 
The first Vesting Date of the Deferred Stock Units shall not occur prior to the second anniversary of the Grant Date and according to the Vesting Date as defined under Section 2 above or other later date that the Committee could provide. However, notwithstanding the above, in the event of the death of a French Participant, all of his or her outstanding Deferred Stock Units shall vest and shares underlying Deferred Stock Units shall be issued as set forth in Section 7 of the French DSU Plan.
 
The French Participant is not authorized to transfer the shares issued pursuant to the Deferred Stock Units until at least the second anniversary of the Vesting Date or other later date determined by the Committee in compliance with the minimum mandatory holding period provided for by Section L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code, even if the French Participant is no longer an employee or corporate officer of a French Entity.
In addition to the restriction on the sale of the shares of Stock issued to the French Participants in the preceding paragraph, said shares may not be sold during certain closed periods (set forth in Section 8 of this French DSU Plan) to the extent such Closed Periods are applicable to Shares underlying French qualified Deferred Stock Units under French law.
 
The Stock issued to the French Participant shall be recorded in an account in the name of the French Participant with the Company or a broker or in such other manner as the Company may otherwise determine in order to ensure compliance with applicable restrictions provided by law.
 
Deferred Stock Units may not be transferred to any third party and Stock will only be issued to the French Participant, except in the event of the French Participant's death.
 
In the event of adjustment or a Change in Control, adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Deferred Stock Units or underlying shares of Stock may be made in accordance with the U.S. Plan and pursuant to applicable French legal and tax rules, unless otherwise provided for by the Committee at its discretion. Adjustments that would violate applicable French rules may result in the disqualification of the Deferred Stock Units for the French favorable tax and social security regime.
 
In the event of the death of a French Participant, all Deferred Stock Units held by the French Participant at the time of death (whether vested or unvested at the time of death) shall become immediately vested. The Company shall issue the underlying shares of Stock to the French Participant's heirs, at their request, within six months following the death of the French Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the French Participant's heirs must comply with the restriction on the sale of shares of Stock set forth in Section 4(b) to the extent as applicable under French rules.
 
Dividend equivalents shall not accrue or be paid to the French participants.
 
It is intended that Deferred Stock Units granted under the French DSU Plan shall qualify for the favorable tax and social security treatment applicable to Deferred Stock Units granted under Sections L. 225-197-1 to L. 225-197-5 of the French Commercial Code, as amended, and in accordance with the relevant provisions set forth by French tax and social security laws. The terms of the French DSU Plan shall be interpreted accordingly and in accordance with the relevant Guidelines published by French tax and social security administrations and subject to the fulfilment of legal, tax and reporting obligations, if any applicable. However, certain corporate transactions or certain modifications to the Deferred Stock Units may impact the qualification of the Deferred Stock Units and underlying shares of Stock for the favourable regime in France.
 
The adoption of this French DSU Plan shall not confer upon the French Participants, or any employees of a French Subsidiary, any employment rights and shall not be construed as part of any employment contracts that a French Subsidiary has with its employees.
 
The French DSU Plan is effective as of July 25, 2005.

Business Criteria.
(iii) Achievement of performance goals in respect of such Performance Awards shall be measured over a performance period, which may overlap with another performance period or periods, of up to ten years, as specified by the Committee. Performance goals shall be established not later than 90 days after the beginning of any performance period applicable to such Performance Awards, or at such other date as may be required or permitted for "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m).
Performance Period; Timing for Establishing Performance Goals.
(c) All determinations by the Committee as to the establishment of performance goals, the amount of any Performance Award and as to the achievement of performance goals relating to Performance Awards under Section 8(b) shall be made in writing in the case of any Award intended to qualify under Code Section 162(m). The Committee may not delegate any responsibility relating to such Performance Awards.
Written Determinations.

Accordingly, Sections 8(b), (c) and (d), shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Code Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder.

General Provisions.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10(a), no Award or other right or interest of a Participant under the Plan shall be pledged, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered or subject to any lien, obligation or liability of such Participant to any party (other than the Company or a Subsidiary), or assigned or transferred by such Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution upon the death of a Participant, and such Awards or rights that may be exercisable shall be exercised during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant or his or her guardian or legal representative.
Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries.
(i) . Unless otherwise specified in the Award, an Option may be transferred pursuant to a domestic relations order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or to an immediate family member of the Participant under such terms and conditions as may be determined, from time to time, by the Committee. An "immediate family member" is defined as the Participant's spouse, child, grandchild, parent or a trust established for the benefit of such family members. With respect to any Option transferred pursuant to this Section 10(a)(i), any such Option shall be exercisable only by the designated transferee or the designated transferee's legal representative.
Transferability of Options
(ii) . A Participant may designate one or more Beneficiaries to receive his or her interest under the Plan that is related to Restricted Stock Units in the event of his or her death.
Transferability of Restricted Stock Units
(iii) . Any Beneficiary or transferee, or other person claiming any rights under the Plan from or through any Participant, shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and any Award agreement applicable to such Participant, except as otherwise determined by the Committee, and to any additional terms and conditions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee.
Beneficiaries and Transferees Subject to Terms of Award
(b) In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Stock, or other property), recapitalization, forward or reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or other similar corporate transaction or event results in existing holders of Stock holding stock or other securities that differ in kind, character or amount from the Stock previously held by them, the Committee shall provide such adjustments or substitutions with respect to the Plan and to the Awards and to any prior plan and to awards granted thereunder as are necessary and appropriate to prevent each holder of outstanding Awards or awards issued under a prior plan from experiencing a significant increase or decrease, solely by reason of such transaction: (i) in the case of Options or similar Awards, in the holder's then existing spread value (i.e., the difference between the exercise or grant price of the Award and the fair market value of the related Stock), (ii) in the case of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, or similar full-value Awards, in the then existing fair market value (disregarding restrictions based on future service) of the holder's Awards and, (iii) the number and kind of shares of Stock by which annual per-person Award limitations are measured under Section 5. The actions required by the foregoing shall in no event be interpreted to result in adjustments or substitutions greater than those needed to provide parity of treatment between the holders of such Awards and holders of Stock. The Committee is authorized to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards (including Performance Awards and performance goals related thereto) in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in the preceding sentence, as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets) affecting the Company, any Subsidiary or any business unit, or the financial statements of the Company or any Subsidiary, or in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations, accounting principles, tax rates and regulations or business conditions or in view of the Committee's assessment of the business strategy of the Company, any Subsidiary or business unit, performance of comparable organizations, economic and business conditions, personal performance of a Participant, and any other circumstances deemed relevant; provided that no such adjustment shall be authorized or made if and to the extent that such authority or the making of such adjustment would cause Performance Awards made
Adjustments.
under Section 8(b) to otherwise fail to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder.
(c) The Company and any Subsidiary is authorized to withhold from any Award granted, any payment relating to an Award under the Plan, including from a distribution of Stock, or any payroll or other payment to a Participant, amounts of withholding and other taxes due or potentially payable in connection with any transaction involving an Award, and to take such other action as the Committee may deem advisable to enable the Company and Participants to satisfy obligations for the payment of withholding taxes and other tax obligations relating to any Award. However, this authority shall not include withholding of taxes above the statutorily required withholding amounts where such excess withholding would result in an earnings charge to the Company under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
Taxes.
(d) The Board or the Committee may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan or the Committee's authority to grant Awards under the Plan without the consent of shareowners or Participants, except that any amendment or alteration to the Plan shall be subject to the approval of the Company's shareowners not later than the annual meeting next following such Board action if such shareowner approval is required by any federal or state law or regulation or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Stock may then be listed or quoted, and the Board may otherwise, in its discretion, determine to submit other such changes to the Plan to shareowners for approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such action may materially and adversely affect the rights of such Participant under any previously granted and outstanding Award, without the consent of an affected Participant. The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, or amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate any Award theretofore granted and any Award agreement relating thereto, except as otherwise provided in the Plan; provided that, without the consent of an affected Participant, no such Committee action may materially and adversely affect the rights of such Participant under such Award.
Changes to the Plan and Awards.
(e) Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as (i) giving any Eligible Person or Participant the right to continue as an Eligible Person or Participant or in the employ or service of the Company or a Subsidiary, (ii) interfering in any way with the right of the Company or a Subsidiary to terminate any Eligible Person's or Participant's employment or service at any time, (iii) giving an Eligible Person or Participant any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan or to be treated uniformly with other Participants or employees, or (iv) except as provided in Section 6(d)(ii), conferring on a Participant any of the rights of a shareowner of the Company unless and until the Participant is duly issued or transferred shares of Stock in accordance with the terms of an Award.
Limitation on Rights Conferred Under Plan.
(f) The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant or obligation to deliver Stock pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Award shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company; provided that the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts and deposit therein cash, Stock, other Awards or other property, or make other arrangements to meet the Company's obligations under the Plan. Such trusts or other arrangements shall be consistent with the "unfunded" status of the Plan unless the Committee otherwise determines. The trustee of such trusts may be authorized to dispose of trust assets and reinvest the proceeds in alternative investments, subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify and in accordance with applicable law.
Unfunded Status of Awards; Creation of Trusts.
(g) Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in the event of a forfeiture of an Award with respect to which a Participant paid cash or other consideration, the Participant shall be repaid the amount of such cash or other consideration. No fractional shares of Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award. The Committee shall determine whether cash, other Awards or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of such fractional shares or whether such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated.
Payments in the Event of Forfeitures; Fractional Shares.
(h) The validity, construction and effect of the Plan, any rules and regulations under the Plan, and any Award agreement shall be determined in accordance with Georgia law, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws, and applicable federal law.
Governing Law.
(i) . This Plan and the Awards are generally not intended to be subject to Code Section 409A. To the extent this Plan or the Awards are subject to Section 409A, the Plan and Awards are intended to comply with Code Section 409A and shall be interpreted and operated accordingly. Notwithstanding any provision of Section 10(d), if this Plan or any Award is subject to Code Section 409A, the Committee reserves the authority to amend this Plan or any Award as necessary to comply with Code Section 409A or to ensure that Code Section 409A does not apply to the Plan or the Award.

Committee
The Committee has determined that it is appropriate to establish a sub-plan for the purpose of permitting Restricted Stock Units granted to employees of a French Entity to qualify for the favorable tax and social security treatment available for such grants in France. The Committee, therefore, intends to establish a sub-plan of the U.S. Plan for the purpose of granting Restricted Stock Units which qualify for the favorable tax and social security treatment in France applicable to shares granted for no consideration under the Sections L. 225-197-1 to L. 225-197-5 of the French Commercial Code, as amended (""), to qualifying employees in France who are resident in France for French tax purposes and/or subject to the French social security regime ("").

French RSU Sub-Plan
Under the French RSU Sub-Plan, the qualifying employees will be granted Restricted Stock Units only as defined in Section 2(d) below. The provisions of Section 6(b), (c), (d) and (f) of the U.S. Plan permitting the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and cash incentive awards are not applicable to grants made under this French RSU Sub-Plan.

However, notwithstanding the above, in the event of the death of a French Participant, all of his or her outstanding Restricted Stock Units shall vest and shares of Stock underlying Restricted Stock Units shall be issued as set forth in Section 8 of the French RSU Sub-Plan.
 
The transfer of shares issued pursuant to the French-Qualified Restricted Stock Units may not occur prior to the expiration of a two-year period as calculated from the Vesting Date, or such other period as is required to comply with the minimum mandatory holding period applicable to French-Qualified Restricted Stock Units under Section L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code, or the relevant Sections of the French Tax Code or the French Social Security Code, as amended, even if the French Participant is no longer an employee or corporate officer of a French Entity.
In addition, the shares of Stock issued pursuant to French-Qualified Restricted Stock Units may not be sold during certain Closed Periods as provided for by Section L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code as amended, and as interpreted by the French administrative guidelines, as long as such Closed Periods are applicable to the sale or transfer of shares of Stock subject to French-qualified Restricted Stock Units.
Further, the Committee may set a holding period for a specific percentage of the shares of Stock underlying the French-Qualified Restricted Stock Units for a French Participant who holds one of the following positions at the Grant Date: Prsident du Conseil d'Administration, Directeur Gnral, Directeur Gnral Dlgu, Membre du Directoire, or Grant de Socits par actions . Any such restriction will be set forth in the RSU Agreement.
 
The Stock issued to the French Participant pursuant to the French-Qualified Restricted Stock Units shall be recorded and held in an account in the name of the French Participant with the Company, the transfer agent for the Company's Stock or a broker or in such other manner as the Company may otherwise determine in order to ensure compliance with applicable French law, including any necessary holding periods.
 
Notwithstanding Section 10(a) of the U.S. Plan, Restricted Stock Units granted to French Participants may not be transferred to any third party, other than by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution. In addition, the
Restricted Stock Units will vest only to the benefit of the French Participants during the lifetime of the French Participants.
 
In the event of Change in Control as set forth in Sections 2(f) and 9 of the U.S. Plan or an adjustment as set forth in Section 10(b) of the U.S. Plan, adjustments to the terms and conditions of the French-Qualified Restricted Stock Units or underlying shares of Stock may be made only in accordance with the U.S. Plan and pursuant to applicable French legal and tax rules. Nevertheless, the Board or the Committee, at its discretion, may decide to make adjustments in the case of a transaction for which adjustments are not authorized under French law, in which case the Restricted Stock Units may no longer qualify for the favorable tax and social security regime in France.
 
In the event of the death of a French Participant, all Restricted Stock Units held by the French Participant at the time of death shall become immediately transferable to the French Participant's heirs. The Company shall issue the underlying shares of Stock to the French Participant's heirs, at their request, if such request occurs, within six months following the death of the French Participant, as provided in the RSU Agreement.
If a French Participant's employment with the Company or French Entity terminates by reason of his or her death or Disability (as defined herein), the French Participant or the French Participant's heirs, as applicable, shall not be subject to the restriction on the transfer of Stock set forth in Section 4(b).
 
If the Restricted Stock Units are otherwise modified or adjusted in a manner in keeping with the terms of the U.S. Plan or as mandated as a matter of law and the modification or adjustment is contrary to the terms and conditions of this French RSU Sub-Plan, the Restricted Stock Units may no longer qualify as French-Qualified Restricted Stock Units. If the Restricted Stock Units no longer qualify as French-Qualified Restricted Stock Units, the Committee may, provided it is authorized to do so under the U.S. Plan, determine to lift, shorten or terminate certain restrictions applicable to the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units or the sale of shares of Stock which may have been imposed under this French RSU Sub-Plan or in the RSU Agreement representing the Restricted Stock Units. In the event that any Restricted Stock Units no longer qualify as French-Qualified Restricted Stock Units, the holder of such Restricted Stock Units shall be ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes and/or social security contributions that he or she is legally required to pay in connection with such Restricted Stock Units.
 
It is intended that Restricted Stock Units granted under this French RSU Sub-Plan shall qualify for the favorable tax and social security treatment applicable to Restricted Stock Units granted under Sections L. 225-197-1 to L. 225-197-5 of the French Commercial Code, as amended, and in accordance with the relevant provisions set forth by French tax and social security laws, although the Company does not undertake or represent that such qualified status will be maintained. The terms of this French RSU Sub-Plan shall be interpreted accordingly and in accordance with the relevant guidelines published by French tax and social security administrations and subject to the fulfilment of certain legal, tax and reporting obligations, if applicable.

Option Agreement
 
French-Qualified Options may not be granted during a Closed Period as set forth by Section L. 225-177 of the French Commercial Code, as amended, to the extent such Closed Periods are applicable to French-Qualified Options granted by the Company. If the Grant Date were to occur during an applicable Closed Period, the Grant Date for Qualified Options shall be the first date following the expiration of the Closed Period which would not be a prohibited Grant Date or the next immediately succeeding trading day if such date was not a trading day.
 
Subject to Section 4(c) below, any French Participant who, on the Grant Date of the Options and to the extent required under French law, is either employed under the terms and conditions of an employment contract with a French Entity ("") or who serves as the Prsident du Conseil d'Administration, Directeur Gnral, Directeur Gnral Dlgu, Membre du Directoire, or Grant de Socits par actions of a French Entity, shall, at the discretion of the Committee, be eligible to receive Options under this French Option Sub-Plan, provided that he or she also satisfies the eligibility conditions of Section 4 of the U.S. Plan.
(a)
contrat de travail
French-Qualified Options may not be issued to a corporate officer of a French Entity, other than an individual serving as the Prsident du Conseil d'Administration, Directeur Gnral, Directeur Gnral Dlgu, Membre du Directoire, or Grant de Socits par actions, unless the corporate officer is an employee of a French Entity, as defined by French law.
(b)
French-Qualified Options may not be issued under this French Sub-Plan to employees owning more than ten percent (10%) of the Company's share capital or to individuals other than French Participants.
(c)
 
Notwithstanding any provision in the U.S. Plan, the exercise price and number of shares of Stock underlying the Options shall not be modified after the Grant Date, except as provided in Section 8 of this French Option Sub-Plan, or as otherwise authorized by French law. To the extent that modifications are not limited to those described in Section 8 or otherwise authorized by French law, such modification may result in the Options no longer qualifying for favorable income tax and social security treatment under French law.
 
 
The Options will vest and become exercisable pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the U.S. Plan, the French Option Sub-Plan and under the Option Agreement delivered to each French Participant.
 
The exercise price per share of Stock payable pursuant to Options issued hereunder shall be fixed by the Committee on the date the Option is granted and in no event shall the exercise price per share of Stock be less than the greater of:
(i) with respect to purchase stock options over the Stock, the higher of either 95% of the average of the closing prices of such Stock during the twenty (20) trading days immediately preceding the Grant Date or 95% of the average purchase price paid for such Stock by the Company;
(ii) with respect to subscription stock options over the Stock, 95% of the average of the closing prices of such Stock during the twenty (20) trading days immediately preceding the Grant Date; and
(iii) the minimum exercise price permitted under the U.S. Plan.
 
Upon exercise of an Option, the full exercise price will be paid either in cash, by check or by credit transfer, exclusive of any other method of payment. Under a cashless exercise program, the French Participant may give irrevocable instructions to a broker to properly deliver the exercise price to the Company. No delivery, surrender or attestation to the ownership of previously owned Stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of delivery equal to the aggregate exercise price may be used to pay the exercise price.
The Stock acquired upon exercise of an Option may be recorded and held in an account in the name of the French Participant with the Company, the transfer agent for the Company's stock or a broker or in such other manner as the Company may otherwise determine in order to ensure compliance with applicable law, including any necessary holding periods.
 
To obtain the favorable tax and social security treatment in France, the French Participant shall not sell or transfer Stock acquired upon exercise of an Option before the expiration of the applicable holding period for French-Qualified Options set forth by Section 163 bis C of the French Tax Code, as amended, except as provided in this French Option Sub-Plan or as otherwise in keeping with French law. To prevent the French Participant from selling the Stock subject to the Option before the expiration of the applicable holding period, the Committee may, in its discretion, restrict the vesting and/or exercisability of the Option and/or the sale or transfer of shares of Stock until the expiration of the applicable holding period, as set forth in the Option Agreement to be delivered to each French Participant. In any case, the restriction on the sale or transfer of Stock cannot exceed three years as from the date of the exercise of the Options. However, the French Participant may be permitted to sell the Stock subject to the Option before the expiration of the applicable holding period in the case of Forced Retirement, Disability, death or dismissal as defined in Section 91 ter of Exhibit II to the French Tax Code, as amended and as provided for in the Option Agreement to be delivered to the French Participant.
 
The Committee may impose a specific holding period for the shares of Stock issued at exercise of the Options or a restriction on the exercise of Options for a French Participant who holds one of the following positions at the Grant Date: Prsident du Conseil d'Administration, Directeur Gnral, Directeur Gnral Dlgu, Membre du Directoire, or Grant de Socits par actions. Any such restriction will be set forth in the Option Agreement.
 
Notwithstanding Section 7 of the U.S. Plan, Options granted to French Participants may not be transferred to any third party, other than by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution. In addition, the Options are exercisable only by the French Participant during his or her lifetime.
 
Notwithstanding any provision in the U.S. Plan, adjustments to the Option exercise price and/or the number of shares of Stock subject to an Option issued hereunder shall be made to preclude the dilution or enlargement of benefits under the Option only in the event of certain transactions by the Company listed under Section L. 225-181 of the French Commercial Code, as amended, a repurchase of Stock by the Company at a price higher than the stock quotation price on the open market, and according to the provisions of Section L. 228-99 of the French Commercial Code, as amended, as well as according to specific decrees.
In the event of Change in Control as set forth in the Option Agreement or an adjustment as set forth in Section 9 of the U.S. Plan, adjustments to the terms and conditions of the French-Qualified Options or underlying shares of Stock may be made only in accordance with the U.S. Plan and pursuant to applicable French legal and tax rules.
Nevertheless, the Board or the Committee, at its discretion, may determine to make adjustments in the case of a transaction for which adjustments are not authorized under French law, in which case the Options may no longer qualify as French-Qualified Options.
 
In the event of the death of a French Participant while he or she is actively employed, all Options held by the French Participant at the time of death shall become immediately vested and may, for the six (6)-month period following the death, be exercised by the French Participant's heirs. Any Option which remains unexercised shall expire six (6) months following the date of the French Participant's death. The six (6)-month exercise period will apply without regard to the term of the French-Qualified Option as described in Section 14 of this French Option Sub-Plan. If a French Participant's employment with the Company or any French Entity of the Company terminates by reason of his or her death, the French Participant's heirs will not be subject to the restriction on the sale of shares set forth in Section 6(d).

In the event of the death of a French Participant prior to the expiration of the Option term but after the termination of the French Participant's employment, vested Options may be exercised by the French Participant's only during the six (6)-month period following the Optionee's death. The six (6)-month exercise period will apply without regard to the term of the French-Qualified Option as described in Section 14 of this French Option Sub-Plan.
(b)
 
(a) If a French Participant's employment is terminated by reason of Disability, his or her Option will benefit from the favorable treatment of French-Qualified Options, irrespective of the date of sale of the shares of Stock.
(b) If a French Participant's employment is terminated by reason of his or her Forced Retirement or dismissal as defined by Section 91-ter of Exhibit II to the French Tax Code and as construed by the French Tax Circulars and subject to the fulfillment of related conditions, his or her Option will benefit from the favorable treatment of French-Qualified Options, irrespective of the date of sale of the shares of Stock, only if exercised at least three months prior to the effective date of the Forced Retirement or three months prior to the receipt of the notice of dismissal by the French Participant and as provided for in Option Agreement to be delivered to the French Participant .
 
If the Options are otherwise modified or adjusted in a manner in keeping with the terms of the U.S. Plan or as mandated as a matter of law and the modification or adjustment is contrary to the terms and conditions of this French Option Sub-Plan, the Options may no longer qualify for the favorable tax and social security regime in France. If the Options no longer qualify as French-Qualified Options, the Committee may, provided it is authorized to do so under the U.S. Plan, determine to lift, shorten or terminate certain restrictions applicable to the vesting of the Options or the sale of shares of Stock which may have been imposed under this French Option Sub-Plan or in the Option Agreement. In the event that any Options no longer qualify as French-Qualified Options, the holder of such Options shall be ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes and/or social security contributions that he or she is legally required to pay in connection with such Options.
 
It is intended that Options granted under this French Option Sub-Plan will qualify for the favorable tax and social security treatment applicable to Options granted under Sections L. 225-177 to L. 225-186 of the French Commercial Code, as amended, and in accordance with the relevant provisions set forth by French tax and social security laws, although the Company does not undertake or represent that such qualified status will be maintained. The terms of this French Option Sub-Plan shall be interpreted accordingly and in accordance with the relevant provisions set forth by French tax and social security laws, the French tax and social security authorities, any relevant guidelines published by French tax and social security authorities and are subject to the fulfilment of certain legal, tax and reporting obligations, if applicable.
 
The adoption of this French Option Sub-Plan shall not confer upon the French Participants or any employees of a French Entity, any employment rights and shall not be construed as part of any employment contracts that a French Entity has with its employees.
 
The Option term will be as determined by the Committee at the Grant Date. The Option term will be extended only in the event of the death of a French Participant, but in no event will any French-Qualified Option be exercisable beyond six (6) months following the date of death of the French Participant.
 
Subject to the terms of the U.S. Plan, the Committee retains the right to amend or terminate the French Option Sub-Plan at any time. Such amendments would only apply to future grants and would not be retroactive.
 
The French Option Sub-Plan is effective as of October 23, 2007 and is amended as of October 29, 2008.
