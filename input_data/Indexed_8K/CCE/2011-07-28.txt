positively affected second-quarter results by approximately 10 cents per share compared to prior year.
Items affecting comparability and other pro forma adjustments are detailed on pages 10 and 11 of this release.
Second-quarter revenue totaled $2.41 billion, an increase of 22 percent from pro forma 2010 results, and up 8 percent on a currency neutral basis. Comparable quarterly operating income was up 21 percent over prior year pro forma results, and up 6

"A combination of solid execution with volume and pricing growth, coupled with strong response to our brands and products from our consumers and our customers, helped drive excellent second-quarter results," said John F. Brock, chairman and chief executive officer. "This performance demonstrates both the growth potential of the Western European markets we serve and the positive impact of our operating strategies and initiatives.
"We continue to seize opportunities for profitable growth by focusing on building our brands, enhancing our customer service, and maximizing the efficiency of our operations," Mr. Brock said.

Still beverage volume increased approximately 1

"Our second-quarter results demonstrate our ability to drive our business forward with strong day-to-day execution and a commitment to customer service," said Hubert Patricot, executive vice president and president, European Group. "These factors, coupled with our sharp focus on costs, leave us well positioned to build on five straight years of operating profit growth in Europe, maximize the value of our brands, and deliver on our growth objectives," Mr. Patricot said.
CCE continues to expect earnings per diluted common share in a range of $2.10 to $2.15. This includes a currency benefit of approximately 15 cents to full-year earnings per share based on recent rates.

Revenue is expected to grow in a mid single-digit range, with expected operating income growth in a mid single-digit to high single-digit range. Full-year cost of goods sold is expected to increase approximately 3 percent. Gross margins are expected to be essentially flat for the year, though we expect modest year-over-year margin decreases in the third quarter with year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter. Operating margins are expected to be flat to up modestly for the full year. This outlook is comparable, currency neutral, and relative to 2010 pro forma financials.
The company also expects free cash flow of approximately $475 to $500 million, with capital expenditures of approximately $400 million. Weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 percent and the effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to be in a range of 26 percent to 28 percent.
CCE remains on track to complete a share repurchase program of approximately $1 billion by the end of 2011 or early 2012. As part of this program, CCE purchased $200 million of its shares during the second quarter of 2011, bringing total repurchases since the program was announced in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $600 million. Going forward, these plans may be adjusted depending on economic, operating, or other factors, including acquisition opportunities.

(a)
Prior to the fourth quarter of 2010, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on a "carve-out" basis from legacy CCE's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements using the historical results of operations, assets, and liabilities attributable to the legal entities that comprised new CCE at the effective date of the Merger with The Coca-Cola Company ("TCCC"). These legal entities included all that were previously part of legacy CCE's Europe operating segment, as well as Coca-Cola Enterprises (Canada) Bottling Finance Company. Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the fourth quarter of 2010 also included an allocation of certain corporate expenses under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") 55 that related to services provided to us by legacy CCE. Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the fourth quarter of 2010 do not include the acquired bottling operations in Norway and Sweden.
(b)
For the calculation of basic earnings per common share in periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2010, we used the number of shares outstanding immediately following the transaction with TCCC. For periods subsequent to the transaction with TCCC, we used the actual number of weighted average common shares outstanding during that period. There were no dilutive securities in periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2010. For periods subsequent to the transaction with TCCC, we used the actual number of dilutive securities during that period.
