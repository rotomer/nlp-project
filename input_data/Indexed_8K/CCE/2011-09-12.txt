CCE continues to expect full-year earnings per diluted common share in a range of $2.10 to $2.15. This includes an expected currency benefit of approximately 15 cents based on recent rates.
Revenue is expected to grow in a mid single-digit range, with expected operating income growth in a mid single-digit to high single-digit range. Full-year cost of goods sold is expected to increase approximately 3 percent. Gross margins are expected to be essentially flat for the year, though we expect modest year-over-year margin decreases in the third quarter with year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter. Operating margins are expected to be flat to up modestly for the full year. This outlook is comparable, currency neutral, and relative to 2010 pro forma financials.
The company also expects free cash flow of approximately $475 to $500 million, with capital expenditures of approximately $400 million.  Weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 percent, and the effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to be in a range of 26 percent to 28 percent.  The company also announced an expected year-end ratio of net debt to EBITDA of approximately 1.8.
 
Long term, the company continues to expect to reach the following objectives on a comparable and currency neutral basis:
CCE also affirmed its long-term capital structure target of 2.5 to 3.0 times net debt to EBITDA.  Additionally, the company expects annual capital expenditures to remain at approximately 5 percent of total revenues.
 
CCE is now on track to complete its current share repurchase program of approximately $1 billion by the end of 2011.  Since the program was announced in the fourth quarter of 2010, the company has purchased approximately $750 million of its shares, including approximately $150 million to date in the third quarter.
The Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase program to begin once the current program is completed.
