Limits on Transferability; Beneficiaries.
 
(i)           .

Any Beneficiary or transferee, or other person claiming any rights under the Plan from or through any Participant, shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan and any Award agreement applicable to such Participant, except as otherwise determined by the Committee, and to any additional terms and conditions deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee.
Beneficiaries and Transferees Subject to Terms of Award
 
(b)             In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Stock, or other property), recapitalization, forward or reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or other similar corporate transaction or event results in existing holders of Stock holding stock or other securities that differ in kind, character or amount from the Stock previously held by them, the Committee shall provide such adjustments or substitutions with respect to the Plan and to the Awards and to any prior plan and to awards granted thereunder as are necessary and appropriate to prevent each holder of outstanding Awards or awards issued under a prior plan from experiencing a significant increase or decrease, solely by reason of such transaction: (i) in the case of Options or similar Awards, in the holders then existing spread value (i.e., the difference between the exercise or grant price of the Award and the fair market value of the related Stock), (ii) in the case of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, or similar full-value Awards, in the then existing fair market value (disregarding restrictions based on future service) of the holders Awards and, (iii) the number and kind of shares of Stock by which annual per-person Award limitations are measured under Section 5.  The actions required by the foregoing shall in no event be interpreted to result in adjustments or substitutions greater than those needed to provide parity of treatment between the holders of such Awards and holders of Stock.  The Committee is authorized to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards (including Performance Awards and performance goals related thereto) in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, events described in the preceding sentence, as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets) affecting the Company, any Subsidiary or any business unit, or the financial statements of the Company or any Subsidiary, or in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations, accounting principles, tax rates and regulations or business conditions or in view of the Committees assessment of the business strategy of the Company, any Subsidiary or business unit, performance of comparable organizations, economic and business conditions, personal performance of a Participant, and any other circumstances deemed relevant; provided that no such adjustment shall be authorized or made if and to the extent that such authority or the making of such adjustment would cause Performance Awards made underSection 8(b) to otherwise fail to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder.
Adjustments.
 
 
(c)             The Company and any Subsidiary is authorized to withhold from any Award granted, any payment relating to an Award under the Plan, including from a distribution of Stock, or any payroll or other payment to a Participant, amounts of withholding and other taxes due or potentially payable in connection with any transaction involving an Award, and to take such other action as the Committee may deem advisable to enable the Company and Participants to satisfy obligations for the payment of withholding taxes and other tax obligations relating to any Award.  However, this authority shall not include withholding of taxes above the statutorily required withholding amounts where such excess withholding would result in an earnings charge to the Company under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
Taxes.
 
(d)             The Board or the Committee may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan or the Committees authority to grant Awards under the Plan without the consent of shareowners or Participants, except that any amendment or alteration to the Plan shall be subject to the approval of the Companys shareowners not later than the annual meeting next following such Board action if such shareowner approval is required by any federal or state law or regulation or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Stock may then be listed or quoted, and the Board may otherwise, in its discretion, determine to submit other such changes to the Plan to shareowners for approval.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such action may materially and adversely affect the rights of such Participant under any previously granted and outstanding Award, without the consent of an affected Participant.  The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, or amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate any Award theretofore granted and any Award agreement relating thereto, except as otherwise provided in the Plan; provided that, without the consent of an affected Participant, no such Committee action may materially and adversely affect the rights of such Participant under such Award.

(f)             The Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded plan for incentive compensation.  With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant or obligation to deliver Stock pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Award shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company; provided that the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts and deposit therein cash, Stock, other Awards or other property, or make other arrangements to meet the Companys obligations under the Plan.  Such trusts or other arrangements shall be consistent with the unfunded status of the Plan unless the Committee otherwise determines.  The trustee of such trusts may be authorized to dispose of trust assets and reinvest the proceeds in alternative investments, subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify and in accordance with applicable law.

(g)             Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in the event of a forfeiture of an Award with respect to which a Participant paid cash or other consideration, the Participant shall be repaid the amount of such cash or other consideration.  No fractional shares of Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award.  The Committee shall determine whether cash, other Awards or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of such fractional shares or whether such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated.
Payments in the Event of Forfeitures; Fractional Shares.
 
(h)             The validity, construction and effect of the Plan, any rules and regulations under the Plan, and any Award agreement shall be determined in accordance with Georgia law, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws, and applicable federal law.

Notwithstanding any provision of Section 10(d), if this Plan or any Award is subject to Code Section 409A, the Committee reserves the authority to amend this Plan or any Award as necessary to comply with Code Section 409A or to ensure that Code Section 409A does not apply to the Plan or the Award.
