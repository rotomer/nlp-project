FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CCE PRESENTS AT DEUTSCHE BANK GLOBAL CONSUMER CONFERENCE,
PROVIDES FULL-YEAR 2012 GUIDANCE
ATLANTA, June 18, 2012  Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE/Euronext Paris: CCE) will discuss its plans and outlook with analysts and investors at the Deutsche Bank Global Consumer Conference in Paris on June 19 at 10:45 a.m. ET (4:45 p.m. in Paris). The public can access the presentation through our website, www.cokecce.com.
 
John F. Brock, chairman of the board and chief executive officer, and Bill Douglas, executive vice president and chief financial officer, will deliver the remarks.
 
In the presentation, CCE will provide 2012 full-year guidance, affirming earnings per diluted common share growth of approximately 10 percent, revising revenue growth to a mid to high single-digit range, and affirming operating income growth in a mid-single-digit range. This guidance is comparable and currency neutral. Although it is still early to predict the full-year 2012 currency impact, currency translation would decrease full-year earnings per share in a high single-digit range, based on recent rates.
