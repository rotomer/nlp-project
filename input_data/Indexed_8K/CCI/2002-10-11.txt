Item 5. Other Events Crown Castle International Corp. is in the process of restructuring its U.S. business in order to flatten its organizational structure to better align with customer demand. The restructuring streamlines Crown Castle's U.S. business into seven geographic areas with each such area being responsible for the leasing and management of approximately 1,500 towers and providing select services. Crown Castle expects to reduce its workforce by approximately 250 employees (including some at the holding company), close some smaller offices and take a restructuring charge of approximately $7 million to $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. The restructuring is expected to reduce annual general and administrative expenses by approximately $11 million to $14 million. Forward-Looking Statements This document contains forward-looking statements and information that are based on management's beliefs as well as assumptions made by and based upon information currently available to management. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, expectations, projections and estimates regarding (i) the amount general and administrative expenses will be reduced, (ii) the amount of the restructuring charge, (iii) the number of U.S. business regions resulting from the restructuring, and (iv) the amount by which the workforce will be reduced. Although Crown Castle believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Such statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including but not limited to (i) those relating to the matters described above, (ii) those included in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and (iii) the success or failure of our efforts to implement our business strategy and the restructuring.
