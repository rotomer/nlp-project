Item 5. Other Events Restricted Stock Award Program In January 2003, Crown Castle International Corp. ("Company") will grant, pursuant to the Company's 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, approximately 6,000,000 shares of restricted stock to over 350 of its employees, including 1,770,000 shares of restricted stock to seven of its senior executive officers ("Executive Officers"), as described in more detail below. The shares awarded will be recognized as non-cash general and administrative compensation charges in the Company's consolidated statement of operations over the vesting period of the restricted stock, based on the fair market value of the shares at the grant dates. The restricted stock is being issued in lieu of the Company's annual stock option grants for 2003. The shares of restricted stock will be granted subject to the terms of the Restricted Stock Agreements to be executed in connection with such grants and will generally vest (i.e., the transfer and forfeiture restrictions terminate) in the largest aggregate number of shares vesting pursuant to either (i) Time Vesting (defined below) or (ii) Performance Vesting (defined below). The restricted stock vests over time at 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30% respectively, on each November 14 for the years 2003 through 2007 ("Time Vesting"). Performance Vesting relates to target increases in the per share closing price of the Company's common stock ("Stock") at or above a base price of $3.69. The base price is equal to the average closing price per share of Stock for a period of five trading days established by the Company's Board of Directors at the time it approved the granting of restricted stock. If and when the Stock closes at or above per share prices equal to 150% of the base price ($5.54), 225% of the base price ($8.30) and 337% of the base price ($12.45) for 20 consecutive trading days, 33% of the restricted stock performance vests upon reaching each price target ("Performance Vesting"). If a restricted stockholder's employment with the Company is terminated, any remaining, unvested shares of restricted stock which such individual holds are generally forfeited and surrendered to the Company. The grant of restricted stock to certain officers of the Company will be conditioned upon such officers executing agreements containing certain restrictions, including non-compete, non-solicitation and/or minimum stock ownership provisions. The Executive Officers listed below were granted the following number of shares of restricted stock: Each of the Executive Officers has executed an agreement that contains all of the restrictions mentioned above and which either replaces or supplements existing severance agreements with such Executive Officer. More specifically, each of the agreements has provisions that generally prohibit an Executive Officer, for a period of 12 months following the termination of such officer's employment with the Company, from (1) engaging in business activities relating to wireless communication or broadcast towers which compete with the Company or its affiliates in the United States, the United Kingdom or Australia and (2) soliciting employees of the Company and its affiliates. Further, the agreements contain provisions requiring each of the Executive Officers to own and hold at all times during his employment with the Company, a specified number of shares of Stock as indicated above (an aggregate of 310,000 shares of Stock), which number does not include unvested restricted stock which remain subject to transfer and forfeiture restrictions. The Executive Officers already own an aggregate of 451,730 shares of Stock, and an Executive Officer who does not own the required minimum number of shares of Stock has until November 14, 2004 to acquire such shares. If an Executive Officer is terminated without cause or the officer terminates his employment for good reason (other than during a change in control period), then most of the agreements provide that the shares of restricted stock described above and awarded to such officer will generally continue to vest as if the officer were an employee of the Company for three years after such termination. The agreements will generally continue severance compensation terms the same as those contained in previously existing severance agreements (summarized in the Company's Proxy Statement as filed with the SEC on April 24, 2002). 1

EXHIBIT 10.1 RSA____ RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT AGREEMENT effective as of the ___ day of January, 2003 ("Issuance Date"), between CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP. ("Company"), a Delaware corporation, and _______________________ ("Holder"). Holder has been serving as a key employee of the Company and/or one of its Affiliates. In recognition of past service and in order to encourage Holder to remain with the Company and its Affiliates (the "Group") and devote Holder's best efforts to their affairs, thereby advancing the interests of the Company and its shareholders, the Company and Holder agree as follows: 1. Issuance of Stock. Upon the execution of this Agreement and for consideration from Holder to the Company in the form of past services to the Group, the fair market value of which is at least equal to $.01 per share times the number of the shares issued hereunder, the Company shall issue to Holder ____________________ shares of the $.01 par value Common Stock of the Company ("Stock"). The shares of Stock issued to Holder under this Agreement ("Holder's Shares") shall be subject to all of the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement and in the Crown Castle International Corp. 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2001 Plan"), which is incorporated herein by reference as a part of this Agreement. "Affiliate" and "Committee" shall have the meaning contained in the 2001 Plan. 2. Forfeiture Restrictions. The Holder's Shares shall not be sold, assigned, pledged, or otherwise transferred except as provided herein, and Holder shall be obligated to forfeit and surrender, without further consideration from the Company, such shares (to the extent then subject to the Forfeiture Restrictions) to the Company in accordance with this Agreement. The prohibition against transfer and the obligation to forfeit and surrender shares to the Company are herein collectively referred to as the "Forfeiture Restrictions," and the Holder's Shares which are subject to the Forfeiture Restrictions are herein sometimes referred to as "Restricted Shares." The Forfeiture Restrictions shall be binding upon and enforceable against any transferee of Restricted Shares. 3. Performance Measures. (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4 hereof, the lapsing of the Forfeiture Restrictions on the Restricted Shares hereunder shall be contingent upon meeting the applicable time measure ("Time Measure") or stock price target measure ("Target Measure") described below while Holder is an employee or a member of the board of directors of the Company or one of its Affiliates. The applicable measure ("Measure") is either the Time Measure or Target Measure determined by the Measure that results in the largest aggregate number of Holder's Shares no longer being Restricted Shares.
(b) The Time Measure is the date indicated below with the percentage beside such date being the percentage of the Holder's Shares no longer subject to the Forfeiture Restrictions. (c) The Target Measure is the date that the price of a share of Stock closes at a price equal to or above the price indicated below for twenty (20) consecutive trade days after the Issuance Date with the percentage beside the stock price per share being the percentage of the Holder's Shares no longer subject to Forfeiture Restrictions. The closing price of a share of Stock shall be the closing quotation on the New York Stock Exchange for the applicable date. (d) As soon as administratively feasible after a Measure is satisfied that causes the lapse of Forfeiture Restrictions as to Restricted Shares, the Committee shall certify in writing that the applicable Measure has been satisfied and the Forfeiture Restrictions shall lapse as to the Restricted Shares as described above. The period from the effective date of this Agreement to the date of the Committee's determination as to whether or not an applicable Measure was satisfied is sometimes hereinafter called the "Restricted Period". 4. Termination of Employment of Service. If Holder terminates employment or service with the Group prior to the end of the Performance Period, then this Restricted Stock Award shall be forfeited and the remaining Restricted Shares shall be surrendered to the Company; provided, however, that the Committee may (subject to restrictions in the 2001 Plan), in its sole discretion, cause the Forfeiture Restrictions to lapse as to all or a part of the Restricted Shares. 5. Shares Received in Reorganization or Stock Split. The transfer restrictions of Section 2 shall not apply to the exchange of Restricted Shares pursuant to a plan of reorganization of the Company, but the stock or securities received in exchange therefor, and any stock received as a result of a stock split or stock dividend with respect to Restricted Shares, shall also become Restricted Shares subject to the Forfeiture Restrictions. 6. Endorsement on Certificate. Each certificate representing Restricted Shares, if the shares of Restricted Stock are represented by a stock certificate prior lapse of applicable Forfeiture Restrictions, shall be conspicuously endorsed as follows: 2
"The shares of Stock evidenced by this certificate have been issued pursuant to the terms of the Crown Castle International Corp. ("Company") 2001 Stock Incentive Plan ("Plan"). The shares of Stock evidenced by this certificate are subject to forfeiture and may not be sold, assigned, pledged, or transferred except as provided by the terms and conditions of a Restricted Stock Agreement ("Agreement") dated January __, 2003, between the Company and the registered holder of the shares. A copy of the Plan and Agreement are available from the Company. 7. Community Interest of Spouse. The community interest, if any, of any spouse of Holder in any of the Restricted Shares shall be subject to all the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Agreement, and shall be forfeited and surrendered to the Company upon the occurrence of any of the events requiring Holder's interest in such Restricted Shares to be so forfeited and surrendered pursuant to this Agreement. 8. Withholding of Tax. To the extent the issuance of Stock or the lapse of Forfeiture Restrictions results in the receipt of compensation by Holder for tax purposes, Holder shall deliver to the Company such amount of money or shares of Stock as the Company may require to meet its obligation under applicable tax laws or regulations. The Company has the right to withhold Holder's Shares until Holder has made arrangements approved by the Company to satisfy all applicable minimum tax withholding requirements of the Company. 9. Tax Election. If Holder makes the election authorized by Section 83(b) of the Code, Holder shall submit to the Company a copy of the statement filed by Holder to make such election. 10. Stock Power and Retention of Certificates. The Company may require Holder to execute and deliver to the Company a stock power in blank with respect to the Restricted Shares and may, in its sole discretion, determine to retain possession of the certificates for shares with respect to which the Forfeiture Restrictions have not lapsed. The Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to exercise such stock power in the event that the Company becomes entitled to the shares pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 hereof. Notwithstanding retention of such certificates by the Company, Holder shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 hereof, have all rights (including dividend and voting rights) with respect to the restricted shares. Upon lapse of the Forfeiture Restrictions as to all or a part of the Restricted Shares, the Company shall deliver to Holder a new certificate representing such Holder's Stock without any restrictive endorsement. 11. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any successors to the Company and all persons lawfully claiming under Holder. 12. Contract Terms. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, if the Holder has entered into a separate contract or agreement with the Company which affects the Restricted Shares issued hereunder, the provisions of such separate contract or agreement shall control over any inconsistent provisions of this Agreement. 13. Modification. Any modification of this Agreement will be effective only if it is in writing and signed by each party whose rights hereunder are affected thereby, except to the 3
extent that such modification occurs pursuant to Section 11 of the 2001 Plan or as a result of an amendment of the 2001 Plan made in accordance with Section 12 of the 2001 Plan. 14. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflicts of laws principles thereof. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has executed this Agreement by its duly authorized officers, and Holder and his or her spouse have executed this Agreement, on the dates specified below.

The Company as to Stock Options granted to the 6
Executive may not (a) require the exercise of such Stock Options, (b) reduce the exercise period for such Stock Options or (c) otherwise take action to circumvent the exercise period for such Stock Options as provided above. The above provisions shall supercede any contrary provisions in any stock option agreement, stock option certificate or other document. 4.5 Excise Tax Payments. (a) Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, in the event of the determination (as hereinafter provided) that any required payment by the Company to or for benefit of the Executive (whether paid or payable pursuant to the terms of the Agreement or otherwise (individually and collectively, "Payment")) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any successor provision thereto (the "Excise Tax"), the Executive shall be entitled to receive an additional payment or payments (individually or collectively, "Tax Assistance Payment"), which shall include an amount such that, after the Executive pays (1) all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes) and (2) any Excise Tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed upon the Tax Assistance Payment, the Executive retains so much of the Tax Assistance Payment as is equal to the Excise Tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed on the Payment. (b) Subject to the provisions hereinafter concerning the provision of notice of a claim by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), all determinations required to be made under these provisions, including whether an Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, the amount of such Excise Tax and whether the Company is required to pay the Executive a Tax Assistance Payment and the amount of such Tax Assistance Payment, if any, shall be made by the Company's independent accountants or such other nationally recognized accounting firm retained by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the Executive ("Accounting Firm"). The Company shall direct the Accounting Firm to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both the Executive and the Company within 30 days after the payment or provision of any benefit that could give rise to an Excise Tax and any such other time or times as the Executive or the Company may request. If the Accounting Firm determines that any Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, the Company shall pay the required Tax Assistance Payment to the Executive within 10 business days after the Company receives such determination and calculations with respect to any Payment to the Executive. (c) Any federal tax returns the Executive files shall be prepared and filed on a basis consistent with the determination of the Accounting Firm with respect to the Excise Tax payable by the Executive. If the Accounting Firm determines that the Executive is required to pay no Excise Tax, it shall (at the same time it makes such determination) furnish the Executive and the Company an opinion that the Executive has substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on the Executive's federal income tax return. However, in view of the uncertainty concerning application of Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) at the time of any determination made hereunder by the Accounting Firm, 7
it is possible that a Tax Assistance Payment that should have been made by the Company will not have been made ("Underpayment"), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event the Company exhausts or fails to pursue its remedies pursuant to the provisions concerning notice of a claim by the IRS, and the Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Executive shall direct the Accounting Firm to determine the amount of the Underpayment and to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations as promptly as possible both to the Executive and to the Company, which shall pay the amount of such Underpayment to the Executive or for the Executive's benefit within 10 business days following the Company's receipt of such determination and calculations. (d) Each of the Executive and the Company shall provide the Accounting Firm access to and copies of any books, records and documents in the Executive's or its possession, as the case may be, reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm, and shall otherwise cooperate with the Accounting Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determination and calculations required or contemplated hereunder. (e) The Company shall bear the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm for services hereunder. If, for any reason, the Executive initially pays such fees and expenses, the Company shall reimburse the Executive the full amount of the same within 10 business days following receipt from the Executive of a statement and reasonable evidence of the Executive's payment thereof. (f) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the IRS that, if successful, would require the Company to pay a Tax Assistance Payment. The Executive shall give such notification as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the 10th business day next following the Executive's receipt of such claim, and the Executive further shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which it is required to be paid (in each case, to the extent known to the Executive). The Executive shall not pay or otherwise satisfy such claim prior to the earlier of (a) the expiration of the 30 calendar day period next following the date on which the Executive gives notice to the Company or (b) the date any payment of the amount with respect to such claim is due. If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall: (i) provide the Company any written records or documents in the Executive's possession relating to such claim and reasonably requested by the Company; (ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company reasonably shall request in writing from time to time, including without limitation accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney competent in respect of the subject matter and reasonably selected by the Company; 8
(iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order to effectively contest such claim; and (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim, provided, however, that the Company directly shall bear and pay all costs and expenses (including without limitation, interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify the Executive and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from and against any and all Excise Tax or income tax (including without limitation, interest and penalties with respect thereto), imposed as a result of such claim and payment of costs and expenses. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with the contest of any claim contemplated by these provisions and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim (provided, however, that the Executive may participate therein at the Executive's own cost and expense) and may, at its option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the Company directs the Executive to pay the tax claimed and to sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, and pay on a current basis all costs of litigation, including without limitation attorneys' fees, on an interest-free basis and shall agree to and shall indemnify the Executive and hold the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax, including without limitation, interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed with respect to such advance; and provided further, however, that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the Executive's taxable year with respect to which the contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of any such contested claim shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Tax Assistance Payment would be payable hereunder, and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or to contest, as the case may be, any other issue(s) raised by the IRS or any other taxing authority. (g) If, after the Executive receives an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to provisions of the last full paragraph, the Executive receives any refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with any applicable provisions of the same paragraph) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after any taxes applicable thereto). If, after the Executive receives such an amount advanced by the Company, a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify the Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to expiration of 30 calendar days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid, and the 9
amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of the Tax Assistance Payment the Company is required to pay the Executive hereunder. V. NONCOMPETITION OBLIGATIONS The Executive shall be subject to the following noncompetition obligations: (a) As consideration for the Severance Agreement as provided herein, the Company and the Executive agree to the noncompetition obligations hereunder. From the effective date of this agreement and continuing for a period of 12 months from the Date of Termination, the Executive shall not personally engage in any "Competitive Activities" (as defined below) within any geographic area in the United States, the United Kingdom or Australia in which the Company or any of its Affiliates is then engaged in Competitive Activities ("Restricted Areas"); including, without limitation, working for, owning, managing, operating, controlling or participating in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or providing consulting or advisory services to, any individual partnership, firm, corporation, institution, entity or other person ("person") engaged in Competitive Activities within any Restricted Areas; provided, however, that the purchase or holding for investment purposes only, of securities of a company shall not constitute "ownership" or "participation in ownership" for these purposes so long as the equity interest in any such company represents less than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of such company. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no person shall be deemed engaged in Competitive Activities if less than 5% of its revenues are derived from "Competitive Activities" as defined in the next paragraph. For such purposes above, "Competitive Activities" mean any business activity involving or relating to owning or operating wireless communication or broadcast towers located in the Restricted Area; provided, however, that if the Company is advised of a business opportunity by the Executive as provided below, and it declines to pursue such business opportunity, the Executive shall be free to pursue such business opportunity and such activity shall not be a "Competitive Activity." If after the Date of Termination the Executive becomes aware of a business opportunity which involves a Competitive Activity in the Restricted Area, the Executive shall fully advise (in writing and indicating that such information is pursuant to this provision) the Company as to such opportunity and will not pursue it except as provided herein. If, within 15 business days of the Executive's advising the Company of such business opportunity, the Board fails to adopt a resolution (and provide a certified copy to the Executive) that it will pursue such business opportunity, the Company will be deemed to have declined to pursue such opportunity. If, after a vote by the Board in favor of pursuing a business opportunity, the Company "fails to pursue" such opportunity, then the Company, including for this purpose the Board, shall be deemed to have declined to pursue such business opportunity as of the date it "fails to pursue" such opportunity. "Fails to pursue" means that the Company has failed to pursue such opportunity in a reasonable commercial manner and "fails to pursue" is irrebutably presumed if (x) within 30 days of such vote, the Company has not signed a confidentiality agreement with the parties representing such business opportunity; (y) within 60 days of such vote, the Company has not begun the due diligence process regarding such business opportunity; or (z) within 120 days of such vote, the Company is not in active discussions, or has otherwise terminated its discussions with the parties representing such business opportunity. 10
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section V(a), activities shall not be deemed to be "Competitive Activities" solely as a result of the Executive's being employed by or otherwise associated with a business of which a unit is in competition with the Company but as to which unit Executive does not have direct or indirect responsibility or direct involvement. For purposes of this Agreement, "Affiliate" of a specified person means a person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the person specified. (b) For a period of 12 months from the Date of Termination, the Executive shall not knowingly induce any employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates to terminate his or her employment with the Company or any of the Affiliates to work with or for the Executive or any of Executive's future employers and provided further that the Executive's response to unsolicited requests for employment references for employees of the Company shall not be a violation of this restriction. (c) The Executive understands that the restrictions set forth in (a) and (b) above may limit the Executive's ability to engage in certain businesses in the Restricted Areas during the 12-month period provided for in (a) and (b) above, but acknowledges that the Executive will receive sufficiently high remuneration and other benefits under this Severance Agreement to justify such restrictions. The Executive acknowledges that money damages would not be sufficient remedy for any breach of the provisions of (a) and (b) above by the Executive, and the Company shall be entitled to enforce such provisions by specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for such breach or any threatened breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for such breach, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in equity to the Company, including without limitation, the recovery of damages from the Executive and the Executive's agents involved in such breach and remedies available to the Company pursuant to other agreements with the Executive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Executive and/or the Executive's agents breach the restrictions set forth in clauses (a) and/or (b), the Company shall in no circumstances be entitled to recover damages or other compensation in respect of all such breaches in excess of the amount paid to Executive pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(ii) or 4.2(a)(ii), as applicable, reduced by an amount equal to the Executive's Base Salary and Annual Bonus. (d) It is expressly understood and agreed that the Company and the Executive consider the restrictions contained in (a) and (b) above to be reasonable and necessary to protect the business of the Company. Nevertheless, if any of the aforesaid restrictions are found by an arbitrator or a court having jurisdiction to be unreasonable, or overly broad as to geographic area or time, or otherwise unenforceable, the parties intend for the restrictions therein set forth to be modified by such arbitrator or court so as to be reasonable and enforceable and, as so modified by such arbitrator or court, to be fully enforced. VI. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 11
6.1 Non-exclusivity of Rights. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other Plan provided by the Company or any of its Affiliates and for which the Executive may qualify (including, without limitation, any insurance benefits relating to death or Disability of the Executive), nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have under any other agreements with the Company or any of its Affiliates ; provided that, by executing this Agreement, the Executive acknowledges Executive's ineligibility for, and waives any other right Executive may have to receive, any other severance or termination benefits provided by the Company or its subsidiaries. Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any Plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates (other than any severance plan or program of the Company and its subsidiaries) at or subsequent to the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with such Plan except as explicitly modified by this Agreement. 6.2 Other Payments and Obligations. The Company's obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company may have against the Executive or others. In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Company agrees to pay, from time to time promptly upon invoice, to the full extent permitted by law, all legal fees and expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any contest or controversy (regardless of the outcome thereof and whether or not litigation is involved) by the Company, the Executive or others of the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of this Agreement or any guarantee of performance thereof. 6.3 Confidential Information. (a) During the Term and thereafter, the Executive shall not, without the written consent of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company ("CEO") or the Board (including an applicable committee of the Board) disclose to any person, other than (i) an employee of the Company, (ii) a person to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance by the Executive of Executive's duties as an executive of the Company, (iii) to the extent required by applicable law (including any rule or regulation) or (iv) to the extent necessary to enforce Executive's rights pursuant to this Agreement, any material confidential information obtained by Executive while in the employ of the Company or its subsidiaries with respect to any of the products, improvements, formulas, designs or styles, processes, customers, methods of distribution or methods of manufacture of the Company or its subsidiaries, the disclosure of which Executive knows will be materially damaging to the Company; provided, however, that confidential information shall not include any information known generally to the public (other than as a result of unauthorized disclosure by the Executive) or any information of a type not otherwise considered confidential by persons engaged in the same business or a business similar to that conducted by the Company. Information concerning a business opportunity described in Section 12
V (a) which the Company declines or "fails to pursue" shall not constitute information for purposes of this section. (b) Any and all inventions made, developed or created by the Executive (whether at the request or suggestion of the Company or otherwise, whether alone or in conjunction with others, and whether during regular hours of work or otherwise) during the period of Executive's employment by the Company or its subsidiaries, which may be directly or indirectly useful in, or relate to, the business of or tests being carried out by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, will be promptly and fully disclosed by the Executive to an appropriate executive officer of the Company and shall be the Company's exclusive property as against the Executive, and the Executive will promptly deliver to an appropriate executive officer of the Company all papers, drawings, models, data and other material relating to any invention made, developed or created by Executive as aforesaid. (c) The Executive will, upon the Company's request and without any payment therefor, execute any documents necessary or advisable in the opinion of the Company's counsel to direct issuance of patents to the Company with respect to such inventions as are to be the Company's exclusive property as against the Executive under Section 6.3 (b) above or to vest in the Company title to such inventions as against the Executive; provided, however, that the expense of securing any such patent will be borne by the Company. (d) The foregoing provisions of this Section 6.3 shall be binding upon the Executive's heirs, successors and legal representatives. (e) In no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section 6.3 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement. 6.4 Release and Agreement. As a condition to the receipt of any compensation and benefits under this Severance Agreement, if the Executive's employment with the Company is subject to a Qualifying Termination, the Executive must first execute a release and agreement, in a reasonable commercial form, which shall release the Company and it subsidiaries and their officers, directors, employees and agents from any and all claims or causes of action arising out of the Executive's employment with the Company or its subsidiaries or the termination of such employment. The performance of the Company's obligations hereunder and the receipt of the compensation and benefits provided hereunder by the Executive shall constitute full settlement of all such claims and causes of action and shall provide consideration for the Executive's release and agreement as described above. 6.5 Indemnification; D&O Coverage (a) If the Executive is made a party, is threatened to be made a party, or reasonably anticipates being made a party, to any Proceeding by reason of the fact that Executive is or was a director, officer, member, employee, agent, manager, trustee, consultant or representative ("Agent") of the Company or any of its Affiliates or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its 13
Affiliates, as an Agent of another person or if any Claim is made, is threatened to be made, or is reasonably anticipated to be made, that arises out of or relates to the Executive's service in any of the foregoing capacities, then the Executive shall promptly notify the Company in writing and be indemnified and held harmless to the fullest extent permitted or authorized by the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the Date of Termination (subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law), against any and all costs, expenses, liabilities and losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' and other professional fees and charges, judgments, interest, expenses of investigation, penalties, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) incurred or suffered by the Executive in connection therewith or in connection with seeking to enforce Executive's rights under this Section 6.5(a), and such indemnification shall continue as to the Executive even if he has ceased to be an Agent of the Company or other person and shall inure to the benefit of the Executive's heirs, executors and administrators. The failure to give prompt notice shall only reduce the indemnification obligation to the extent, if any, that the Company is damaged by such breach. The Executive shall be entitled to prompt advancement of any and all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' and other professional fees and charges) incurred by Executive in connection with any such Proceeding or Claim to the fullest extent permitted or authorized by the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the Date of Termination (subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law), any such advancement to be made promptly after Executive gives written notice, supported by reasonable documentation, requesting such advancement. Such notice shall include, to the extent required by applicable law, an undertaking by the Executive to repay the amounts advanced to the extent that Executive is ultimately determined not to be entitled to indemnification against such costs and expenses. Nothing in this Agreement shall operate to limit or extinguish any right to indemnification, advancement of expenses, or contribution that the Executive would otherwise have (including, without limitation, by agreement or under applicable law). For purposes of this Agreement, "Claim" shall include, without limitation, any claim, demand, request, investigation, dispute, controversy, threat, discovery request, or request for testimony or information and "Proceeding" shall include, without limitation, any actual, threatened, or reasonably anticipated, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative, appellate, formal, informal or other. (b) Neither the failure of the Company (including its Board, independent legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any Proceeding concerning payment of amounts claimed by the Executive under Section 6.5(a) that indemnification of the Executive is proper because Executive has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor a determination by the Company (including its Board, independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the Executive has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the Executive has not met the applicable standard of conduct. (c) A directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (or policies) shall be kept in place until the sixth anniversary of the Date of Termination, providing 14
coverage to the Executive that is no less favorable to Executive in any respect (including, without limitation, with respect to scope, exclusions, amounts, and deductibles) than the coverage then being provided to any other present or former senior executive or director of the Company. 6.6 Successors. (a) This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's legal representatives. (b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns. (c) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. 6.7 Statements Concerning Company or Executive. The Executive shall refrain from willfully and knowingly making any public statement, whether oral or written, about the Company, any of its Affiliates, any Executive Officer or any Board Member, that is disparaging or defamatory to any such person. The Company shall use best efforts to cause each Executive Officer and Board Member to refrain from making any public statement, whether oral or written, that is disparaging or defamatory to the Executive. For purposes of this Section 6.7, an "Executive Officer" is the CEO and any officer directly reporting to the CEO, and a "Board Member" is any individual that is a member of the Board. A violation or threaten violation of any of the above prohibitions may be enjoined by any court with jurisdiction. The rights afforded under this provision are in addition to any and all rights otherwise afforded by applicable law. Nothing shall prevent the Executive or the Company from truthfully and publically correcting incorrect statements or from making truthful disclosures to the extent required (i) by law, by a government agency having supervisory authority over the business of the Company or any of its Affiliates or by any arbitrator, mediator or administrative or legislative body (including a committee thereof) with apparent jurisdiction or (ii) to enforce this Agreement. 6.8 Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given by (i) personal delivery, (ii) registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as indicated below or (iii) nationally recognized overnight courier, with written confirmation of receipt, addressed as indicated below: If to the Executive: Home address as currently shown on Human Resources Department records of 15

The number of shares of Retained Stock shall be adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, spin offs and other relevant changes in the Company's capital structure. Retained Stock shall include (i) restricted stock issued to Executive that is no longer subject to a forfeiture restriction, (ii) stock held in an individual retirement account, 401(k) plan or other qualified plan pursuant to the Code for the primary benefit of the Executive and/or Executive's spouse and (iii) stock held by the Executive's spouse. Restricted stock granted to the Executive by the Company that is subject to forfeiture restrictions shall not be counted as Retained Stock. 6.10 Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement 6.11 Withholding. The Company may withhold from any amount payable under this Agreement such Federal, state or local taxes as shall be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation. 6.12 Waiver. The Executive's failure to insist upon strict compliance with any provision hereof shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such provision or any other provision thereof. 6.13 Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the Company and the Executive with respect to the subject matter hereof. 6.14 At Will Employment. The Executive and the Company acknowledge that the employment of the Executive by the Company is "at will". 6.15 Choice of Law.
