Crown Castle International Contacts: W. Benjamin Moreland, CFO Jay Brown, VP Finance Crown Castle International Corp. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 713-570-3000 Ken Dennard/kdennard@drg-e.com Lisa Elliott/lisae@drg-e.com DRG&E 713-529-6600 CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS February 26, 2003 - HOUSTON, TEXAS - Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year-ended December 31, 2002. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $228.0 million, compared to $238.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2001. Site rental and broadcast transmission revenue for the fourth quarter of 2002 increased 15.0 percent to $179.3 million, up from $155.9 million for the same period in 2001. Net loss (after deduction of dividends on preferred stock and net of gains on repurchases of preferred stock) improved to $4.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2002 from a net loss of $123.3 million for the same period in 2001. Net loss for the fourth quarter is inclusive of $98.7 million in gains from the retirement of debt ($49.1 million gain) and preferred securities ($49.6 million gain). Fourth quarter loss per share was $(0.02) compared to a loss per share of $(0.57) in last year's fourth quarter. Net cash from operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2002 was $126.6 million, up from $53.2 million for the same period in 2001. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $40.0 million, down from $122.0 million for the same period in 2001. Free cash flow, defined as cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, for the fourth quarter of 2002 was a source of cash of $86.6 million, an improvement from a use of cash of $68.8 million for the same period in the prior year. At December 31, 2002, cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments were $631.9 million. Total revenue for the full year 2002 was $901.5 million, compared to $899.0 million for the full year 2001. Site rental and broadcast transmission revenue for 2002 increased 17.7 percent to
Page 2 of 7 $677.8 million, up from $576.0 million in 2001. Net loss (after deduction of dividends on preferred stock and net of gains on repurchases of preferred stock) improved to $252.9 million in 2002 from a net loss of $445.2 million for the full year 2001. Net loss for 2002 is inclusive of $178.5 million in gains from the retirement of debt ($79.1 million gain) and preferred securities ($99.4 million gain). The loss per share for 2002 was $(1.16), compared to a loss per share of $(2.08) for 2001. Net cash from operating activities for 2002 was $208.9 million, up from $131.9 million for 2001. Capital expenditures for 2002 were $277.3 million, down from $683.1 million in 2001. Free cash flow for 2002 was a use of cash of $68.3 million, an improvement from a use of cash of $551.2 million for 2001. Site rental and broadcast transmission gross margin, defined as site rental and broadcast transmission revenue less site rental and broadcast transmission cost of operations, increased 15.6 percent to $107.9 million, up $14.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 from the same period in 2001. For the full year 2002, site rental and broadcast transmission gross margin increased 20.9 percent to $407.8 million, up $70.6 million compared to 2001. Total general and administrative and corporate development expenses declined $13.2 million, or 11.5 percent in 2002 from 2001. US tower results for the fourth quarter of 2002 include the net positive impact of approximately $4.7 million for non-recurring revenue and expense items, consisting primarily of payments for lease terminations and the reimbursement of certain operating costs. "We achieved a significant milestone by producing positive free cash flow for the fourth quarter," stated John P. Kelly, CEO of Crown Castle. "Throughout 2002, our employees made gains on the four priorities we established at the beginning of the year of organic growth, margin expansion, prudent capital allocation and revenue extensions. Through their efforts, we achieved this important milestone. We are extremely proud of our successful launch on October 30, 2002 of Freeview, a new Digital Terrestrial Television network in the United Kingdom, which we expect will result in additional annual revenue of between $37.5 million and $41.0 million with an incremental margin of approximately 80%. The launch of this new media service clearly demonstrates the value of our infrastructure beyond leasing associated with wireless voice services." During the fourth quarter of 2002, Crown Castle developed 42 sites, 37 of which were developed under our agreement with British Telecom in the UK. On a broadband equivalent (BBE) basis, net of churn, Crown Castle added 746 new tenants during the fourth quarter, representing an annualized BBE co-location rate of 0.19 tenants per tower (including the 0.04 BBE negative impact of 129 terminated leases for which the company recorded $2.3 million in
Page 3 of 7 termination payments), on the 15,557 sites owned and managed at the beginning of the quarter. Annual same tower rental revenue growth during 2002 was 10.1 percent in the US, or $3,494 per US site, and 24.7 percent in the UK, or $5,065 per UK site, on the sites owned and operated by Crown Castle on December 31, 2001. In addition to the revenue from new wireless customers, and not included in the above metrics, Crown Castle added approximately $11,400 in annual revenue per UK site from its Freeview contracts. "The results for the fourth quarter of 2002 demonstrate the disciplined operations of our business units," stated W. Benjamin Moreland, CFO of Crown Castle. "We believe we are well on our way to producing sustained free cash flow this year, excluding the final acquisition payment for the BT sites in the UK. Further, we continue to enjoy a superior liquidity position in the tower industry, ending 2002 with over $1.1 billion in total liquidity, comprised of over $630 million in cash balances, up from $571 million last quarter after securities repurchases, and $477 million in availability under our senior credit facilities. Despite a challenging wireless market, we believe we have the liquidity and flexibility to take advantage of potential opportunities that may create long-term value for our shareholders." During the fourth quarter, Crown Castle retired approximately $154 million of senior notes and discount notes, approximately $90 million of preferred and convertible securities and approximately $2 million of common stock using approximately $135 million in cash. The majority of these purchases were outlined in Crown Castle's Form 10-Q for the third quarter 2002 in the footnote entitled "Subsequent Events." OUTLOOK The following statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and assume a US dollar to UK pound exchange rate of 1.55 dollars to 1.00 pound and a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.50 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollar. The following Outlook sections contain forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein are set forth below and in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Page 4 of 7 OUTLOOK FOR FIRST QUARTER 2003 For the first quarter 2003, Crown Castle expects site rental and broadcast transmission revenue to be between $178 million and $182 million including the previously disclosed expiration of approximately $0.8 million of revenue from analog dispatch tenants. Crown Castle expects first quarter 2003 net cash provided by operating activities to be between $(15) million and breakeven. Crown Castle expects total capital expenditures to be between $30 million and $40 million excluding the final site acquisition payment of $78 million to BT during the first quarter 2003. Crown Castle anticipates the foregoing expectations will result in free cash flow for the first quarter 2003 of between $(125) million and $(110) million. OUTLOOK FOR YEARS 2003 AND 2004 For calendar year 2003, Crown Castle expects site rental and broadcast transmission revenue to be between $735 million and $760 million. Crown Castle projects total net cash provided by operating activities of between $140 million and $200 million for 2003. Crown Castle expects total capital expenditures to be between $95 million and $125 million excluding the final site acquisition payment of $78 million to BT during year 2003. Crown Castle expects free cash flow of between $(35) million and breakeven for 2003. Crown Castle's 2003 and 2004 projected net cash provided by operating activities assumes the effect of converting paid-in-kind interest to cash pay for the 10 5/8 percent, 10 3/8 percent, and 11 1/4 percent Senior Discount Notes and the 12 3/4 percent Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock. The following table sets forth Crown Castle's current 2003 to 2004 guidance (dollars in millions):

A telephonic replay of the conference call will be available through March 6, 2003 and may be accessed by calling 303-590-3000 using pass code 519944. An audio archive will also be available on Crown Castle's website at www.crowncastle.com shortly after the call and will be accessible for approximately 90 days.

ADJUSTED EBITDA This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, non-cash general and administrative compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges. It is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles). Further, our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. In connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission has recently adopted rules governing disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures such as Adjusted EBITDA. We are currently evaluating the impact of such rules, including new Regulation G. IMPACT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL As discussed in previous releases, on January 1, 2002, Crown Castle adopted new accounting and disclosure requirements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142"). The most significant provision of SFAS 142 is that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized, but rather will be tested for impairment on an annual basis. As a result, Crown Castle's depreciation and amortization expense will decrease by approximately $60.6 million per year. If amortization of goodwill had not been recorded during the fourth quarter and full year of
Page 6 of 7 2001, Crown Castle's net loss for those periods would have been $87.6 million ($0.50 per share) and $304.5 million ($1.79 per share), respectively. SFAS 142 requires that transitional impairment tests be performed at its adoption, and provides that resulting impairment losses for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be reported as the effect of a change in accounting principal. Crown Castle has completed these initial impairment tests, and has determined that no impairment losses were to be recorded upon the adoption of SFAS 142. Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements and information that are based on management's beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, expectations, projections and estimates regarding (i) revenues and margins generated by Freeview, (ii) liquidity, (iii) currency exchange rates, (iv) revenues, (v) net cash provided by operating activities, (vi) sites to be acquired and constructed, (vii) capital expenditures, and (viii) free cash flow. Although Crown Castle believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Such statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including but not limited to the success or failure of our efforts to implement our business strategy and the following: * Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and limit our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs. * If we are unable to service our indebtedness, our indebtedness may be accelerated. * Our business depends on the demand for wireless communications, which may be lower or slower than anticipated. * The continuation of the current economic and telecommunications industry slowdown could materially and adversely affect our business and the business of our customers. * We may be unable to manage our significant growth. * The loss, consolidation or financial instability of any of our limited number of customers could materially decrease revenues. * Restrictive covenants on our debt instruments may limit our ability to take actions that may be in our best interests. * We operate in an increasingly competitive industry and many of our competitors have significantly more resources than we do or have less debt than we do. * Technology changes may significantly reduce the demand for towers and wireless communications sites. * 2.5G/3G and other technologies, including digital terrestrial television, may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected. * Carrier consolidation or reduced carrier expansion may significantly reduce the demand for towers and wireless communication sites. * Network sharing and other agreements among our customers may act as alternatives to leasing sites from us. * We may not be able to construct or acquire new sites and towers in the locations that we desire. * Demand for our network services business is very volatile which causes our network services operating results to vary significantly for any particular period. * Future expansion of our business may require significant capital expenditures, and we may need additional financing which may not be available at such time. * We generally lease or sublease the land under our sites and towers and may not be able to maintain these leases at commercially viable rates. The loss of any of our ground leases could result in retirement obligations. * Extensive regulations, which could change at any time, govern our business and industry, and we could fail to comply with these regulations. * We could suffer from future claims if radio frequency emissions from equipment on our sites and towers are demonstrated to cause negative health effects. * Our international operations expose us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. * We are heavily dependent on our senior management.
Page 7 of 7 * Disputes with customers and suppliers may adversely affect results. * Sales or issuances, including as dividends, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. * The carrying value of our sites and related goodwill may be subject to impairment in the future if we are unable to add sufficient additional tenants to the sites. Should one or more of these risks materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential factors, which could affect Crown Castle's financial results, is included in Crown Castle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
