Total revenue for the second quarter of 2003 was $224.2 million, compared to $225.5 million for the second quarter of 2002.

Net loss (after deduction of dividends on preferred stock and net of losses on repurchases of preferred stock of $3.0 million for second quarter 2003) was $100.9 million for the second quarter of 2003 compared to a loss of $89.5 million for the same period in 2002.

OPERATING RESULTS
 
US site rental revenue for the second quarter of 2003 increased 6.9% to $110.5 million, up from $103.4 million for the same period in 2002, and UK site rental and broadcast transmission revenue for the second quarter of 2003 increased 16.7% to $72.8 million, up from $62.4 million for the same period in 2002. These revenue results approximate same tower sales as a result of the fact that approximately 98% of Crown Castle's sites on June 30, 2003 were in operation as of April 1, 2002. On a consolidated basis, site rental and broadcast transmission gross margin, defined as site rental and broadcast transmission revenue less site rental and broadcast transmission cost of operations, increased 9.2% to $115.8 million, up $9.8 million in the second quarter of 2003 from the same period in 2002. For the second quarter of 2003, US capital expenditures were $7.7 million, and UK capital expenditures were $12.8 million. During the second quarter of 2003, Crown Castle developed 13 sites in the UK under our agreement with British Telecom.
 
"We are pleased with our core site rental and broadcast transmission business this quarter," stated John P. Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "During the quarter, our business units delivered solid revenue growth together with disciplined management of operating expenses, capital expenditures and working capital, which allowed us to exceed our free cash flow expectations."
 
"While our outlook suggests that leasing activity will remain constant at current levels, we see some indications that US leasing activity may improve during the second half of 2003 and into 2004. A combination of several factors appears to be positively influencing US wireless carriers' desire to deploy additional cell sites to improve network quality."
 
"We remain committed to driving free cash flow growth and have made significant progress in the last quarter," stated W. Benjamin Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "As a result of strong performance at the operating level, we have been able to invest some of our excess liquidity to retire more expensive debt securities. In the last twelve months, taking into account the shares of 12% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock we have purchased to date, we have eliminated $70.0 million of annual interest expense. We believe we can achieve significant interest savings through attractive refinancings and investing our liquidity, and we can foresee a scenario where run-rate total interest expense is less than $200 million by the end of 2004."
 
During the second quarter of 2003, Crown Castle repaid $55.3 million of senior credit facility debt (including $4.7 million in its CCOC facility, $10.0 million in its CCA facility and $40.6 million in its UK facility). At June 30, 2003, Crown Castle had $909.4 million of total

liquidity, comprised of $523.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments, and total availability under its senior credit facilities of $386.2 million.
 
Also during the second quarter, Crown Castle purchased 29,614 shares of its 12% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock for $32.6 million in cash. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter through July 31st, Crown Castle purchased an additional 59,272 shares of its 12% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock for $65.8 million in cash. After the purchases through July 31, 2003, the 12% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock due 2010 had an aggregate redemption value of $166.1 million. Crown Castle currently expects to purchase or redeem the remaining 12% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock outstanding no later than December 15, 2003, the first contractual optional redemption date for such securities.

OUTLOOK
 
The following statements and outlook table are based on current expectations and assumptions and assume a US dollar to UK pound exchange rate of 1.57 dollars to 1.00 pound and a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.60 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollar. This Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein are set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Based in part on improvements in working capital and operating results and lower than expected capital expenditures for the first half of 2003, Crown Castle has adjusted certain elements of its previously provided financial guidance for full year 2003, which results in expected free cash flow increasing from between $29 million and $59 million to between $75 million and $95 million for the full year 2003. Crown Castle's outlook for net cash provided by operating activities is based on interest expense on its existing debt balances and does not include savings from interest expense reductions that Crown Castle expects may be achieved through further debt reductions and refinancings. Crown Castle's 2003 and 2004 projected net cash provided by operating activities assumes the effect of converting paid-in-kind interest to

This press release includes presentations of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Crown Castle defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (both amounts from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows). Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation, amortization and accretion, non-cash general and administrative compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges. Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles). Further, our measure of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Free Cash Flow is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of our ability to execute our business strategy without reliance on additional borrowing or the use of our cash and liquid investments. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of the current financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. Our results under GAAP are set forth in the financial statements attached on pages 8 through 10 of this press release.
