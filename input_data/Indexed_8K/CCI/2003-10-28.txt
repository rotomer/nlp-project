OPERATING RESULTS
 
US site rental revenue for the third quarter of 2003 increased $8.6 million, or 8.2%, to $113.4 million, up from $104.8 million for the same period in 2002, and UK site rental and broadcast transmission revenue for the third quarter of 2003 increased $23.1 million, or 41.7%, to $78.3 million, up from $55.2 million for the same period in 2002. These revenue results approximate same tower sales as a result of the fact that approximately 98% of Crown Castle's sites on September 30, 2003 were in operation as of July 1, 2002. On a consolidated basis, site rental and broadcast transmission gross margin, defined as site rental and broadcast transmission revenue less site rental and broadcast transmission cost of operations, increased 27% to $121.3 million, up $25.6 million in the third quarter of 2003 from the same period in 2002. Year over year comparisons of site rental and broadcast transmission revenue and gross margin were positively impacted $10.5 million and $7.5 million, respectively, by the launch of Freeview in the UK during the fourth quarter of 2002. For the third quarter of 2003, US capital expenditures were $5.3 million and UK capital expenditures were $15.5 million. During the third quarter of 2003, Crown Castle developed 31 sites in the UK under our agreement with British Telecom.
 
"Our business units delivered strong revenue growth this quarter in our core site rental and broadcast transmission business and completed some key agreements," stated John P. Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "While our outlook continues to suggest leasing activity will remain constant at current levels, we see indications that US leasing activity may improve into 2004. We have seen an increase in site applications for our US towers from our customers as they improve their networks. We continue to strive to meet our customers' needs with increased speed and accuracy. Our continued efforts to grow revenue while reducing interest expense, working capital, and capital expenditures resulted in excellent free cash flow results. We remain on track with our initiatives and are on pace to outperform our original free cash flow outlook for 2003, which we provided last year."
 
BALANCE SHEET IMPROVEMENTS
 
On October 10, 2003, Crown Castle announced the completion of an amended $1.6 billion credit facility for its restricted group operating company ("OpCo Facility") and made certain changes to its capital structure. The OpCo Facility is comprised of a $192.5 million Term A loan, a $1.1 billion Term B loan and an unfunded $350 million revolving credit facility. Crown Castle also designated its UK subsidiary ("CCUK") as a restricted subsidiary, repaid the CCUK senior credit facility and will redeem on November 10, 2003 CCUK's 9% Guaranteed Bonds due 2007.

During the third quarter, Crown Castle purchased 179,551 shares of its 12% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock for $198.3 million in cash. At September 30, 2003, the remaining 12% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock due 2010 had an aggregate redemption value of $46.8 million. Crown Castle has delivered notice to redeem the remaining 12% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock at the contractual call price of 106.375% on December 15, 2003, the first optional redemption date for such securities.
 
Also, during the third quarter of 2003, Crown Castle repaid $10.0 million of its Crown Atlantic credit facility. Pro forma for the OpCo Facility, repayment of the CCUK credit facility and the redemption of the CCUK 9% Guaranteed Bonds, at September 30, 2003, Crown Castle had approximately $1.0 billion of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $550 million of cash and cash equivalents and total availability under its OpCo Facility and Crown Atlantic credit facility of approximately $470 million.
 
"We remain committed to increasing free cash flow through growth in our core leasing business and reductions in interest expense," stated W. Benjamin Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "The successful refinancing of our OpCo Facility is an important milestone in our efforts to improve our overall financial profile. We are very focused on improving our leverage and interest coverage ratios ahead of the contractual call dates of our senior notes, which start May 2004. By investing our excess liquidity to purchase our debt securities and through the potential refinancing of a portion of our senior notes next year, we expect to make further progress towards our goal of reducing our run-rate total interest expense to less than $200 million by the end of 2004 and converting the savings into free cash flow growth."
 
On July 1, 2003, Crown Castle adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, ("SFAS 150"). As a result, Crown Castle's 12% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock was reclassified as a liability and the dividends and losses resulting from the purchases of such securities are included in the net loss on the consolidated statement of operations beginning on July 1, 2003.

OUTLOOK
 
The following statements and outlook table are based on current expectations and assumptions and assume a US dollar to UK pound exchange rate of 1.65 dollars to 1.00 pound and a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.60 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollar. This Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein are set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Crown Castle has adjusted certain elements of its previously provided financial guidance for full year 2004, which results in expected free cash flow increasing from between $105 million and $130 million to between $120 million and $140 million for the full year 2004. Crown Castle's outlook for net cash provided by operating activities is based on interest expense on its existing debt balances and does not include savings from interest expense reductions that may be achieved through further debt reductions and refinancings, except for the interest savings from the redemption on December 15, 2003 of the 12% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock. Crown Castle's 2003 and 2004 projected net cash provided by operating activities assumes the effect of converting paid-in-kind interest to cash pay for the 10

This press release includes presentations of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Crown Castle defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (both amounts from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows). Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, minority interests, provision for income taxes, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs and dividends on preferred stock, interest and other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion, non-cash general and administrative compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges (credits). Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles). Further, our measure of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Free Cash Flow is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of our ability to execute our business strategy without reliance on additional borrowing or the use of our cash and liquid investments. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of the current financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. Our results under GAAP are set forth in the financial statements following this press release.
 
Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Comparable GAAP Financial Measures
 
Free Cash Flow is computed as follows
