% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock were presented as part of
dividends on preferred stock in our consolidated statement of operations. Since that date, such gains and losses are presented as part of interest and other income (expense) due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments.
 
Net loss for full year 2003 was $420.9 million, inclusive of $160.3 million in losses from the retirement of debt and preferred securities, compared to a net loss of $272.5 million for the same period in 2002, inclusive of $79.1 million of gains from the retirement of debt. Net loss after deduction of dividends on preferred stock was $474.8 million for the full year 2003, inclusive of $160.0 million in losses from the retirement of debt and preferred securities, compared to a loss of $252.9 million for the same period last year, inclusive of $178.6 million in gains from the retirement of debt and preferred securities. Full year 2003 net loss per share was $(2.19) compared to a loss per share of $(1.16) for full year 2002.
 
Net cash from operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2003 was $116.0 million. Free cash flow, defined as net cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, for the fourth quarter of 2003 was a source of cash of $92.3 million. For the full year 2003, net cash from operating activities was $260.0 million. Free cash flow for the full year 2003 was a source of cash of $141.1 million, an improvement of $209.5 million from a use of cash of $68.3 million for the same period last year.
 
OPERATING RESULTS
 
US site rental revenue for the fourth quarter of 2003 increased $9.6 million, or 8.9%, to $117.7 million, up from $108.0 million for the same period in 2002, and UK site rental and broadcast transmission revenue for the fourth quarter of 2003 increased $23.2 million, or 35.5%, to $88.4 million, up from $65.2 million for the same period in 2002. These revenue results approximate same tower sales as over 99% of Crown Castle's sites were in operation for the 12 months preceding December 31, 2003.
 
On a consolidated basis, site rental and broadcast transmission gross margin, defined as site rental and broadcast transmission revenue less site rental and broadcast transmission cost of operations, increased 21% to $130.5 million, up $22.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 from the same period in 2002. During the past 12 months, Crown Castle's results have benefited predominantly from organic growth and, in part, from the weakening US dollar relative to the currencies of its UK and Australian subsidiaries.
 
Net cash from operating activities and free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2003 benefited from $54.9 million in working capital improvements, including approximately $45 million of
prepaid 2004 rent in the UK. For the fourth quarter of 2003, US capital expenditures were $5.3 million and UK capital expenditures were $17.0 million. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Crown Castle developed 15 sites in the UK under our agreement with British Telecom.
 
"We are pleased with the significant free cash flow generated in 2003," stated John P. Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "Growth in the core business and the reduction of interest expense, capital expenditures, and working capital contributed to an increase in free cash flow in 2003. Based on current run-rate tower revenue and the positive impact of currency movements in the UK and Australia we have raised our 2004 outlook. While our 2004 outlook is currently based on the 2003 level of new leasing activity, we continue to see positive signs from the increase in site applications from our customers in the US, which may result in additional revenue. Likewise, in the UK, we continue to see significant activity as customers deploy their 3G networks. I am very pleased with the degree to which we exceeded our 2003 financial targets and look forward to further financial and operational accomplishments in 2004."
 
BALANCE SHEET IMPROVEMENTS
 
"During the fourth quarter, we significantly reduced interest expense and increased free cash flow," stated W. Benjamin Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "The net result of our refinancing activities during the fourth quarter was to reduce the interest rate by approximately 390 basis points on a portion of our debt, which will save us approximately $37 million per year in interest expense, bringing total annual interest expense to approximately $211 million. In addition, we have extended the maturities of our debt, including our convertible notes and preferred stock, such that 88% of the maturities are at 2010 and beyond. Given our current interest expense coverage and the maturity schedule of our debt, we are comfortable with our plan to continue to reduce our overall leverage through the expected growth in operating results and the investment of free cash flow to pay down debt. We are pleased to end 2003 with total debt and preferred stock of 7.7x fourth quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA, which is down 1.2x from 8.9x at the end of 2002."

The Senior Notes tendered at December 31, 2003 were classified as current maturities of long-term debt at year-end. Crown Castle paid for these notes on January 7, 2004.

% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock due 2010, which had an aggregate redemption value of $47.0 million, for $50.0 million based on the contractual call price of 106.375%.
 
Further, during the fourth quarter, Crown Castle sold $600 million of 7.5% Senior Notes. Crown Castle used the proceeds from these offerings along with existing cash balances for the redemption, tender and purchase of certain of its securities as described above.
Also, during the fourth quarter of 2003, Crown Castle repaid $20 million of its Crown Atlantic credit facility, bringing the remaining balance to $195 million. After adjusting for the January settlement of the cash tender offers for its Senior Notes, at December 31, 2003, Crown Castle had approximately $585 million of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $189 million of cash and cash equivalents and total availability under its OpCo Facility and Crown Atlantic credit facility of approximately $396 million.
 
On February 12, 2004, Crown Castle received unanimous consent from its lenders to amend its Crown Atlantic credit facility to reduce the amount of the revolver from $301.1 million to $250 million.
 
OUTLOOK
 
The following statements and outlook table are based on current expectations and assumptions and assume a US dollar to UK pound exchange rate of 1.75 dollars to 1.00 pound and a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.70 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollar. This Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein are set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Crown Castle has adjusted certain elements of its previously provided financial guidance for full year 2004, including increasing site rental and broadcast transmission revenue from between $810 million and $835 million to between $860 million and $870 million and increasing free cash flow from between $120 million and $140 million to between $145 million and $160 million for the full year 2004. Crown Castle's outlook for net cash provided by operating activities is based on interest expense on its existing debt balances and does not include savings from interest expense reductions that may be achieved through further debt reductions and refinancings.
 
Crown Castle's adjusted 2004 outlook includes an upward adjustment to site rental and broadcast transmission revenue based on fourth quarter 2003 run-rate site rental and broadcast transmission revenue and expected foreign exchange rates. Further, Crown Castle's 2004 outlook assumes that leasing activity remains constant with 2003 leasing activity.

This press release includes presentations of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Crown Castle defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (both amounts from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows). Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, minority interests, provision for income taxes, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs and dividends on preferred stock, interest and other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion, non-cash general and administrative compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges (credits). Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles). Further, our measure of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Free Cash Flow is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of our ability to execute our business strategy without reliance on additional borrowing or the use of our cash and liquid investments. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of the current financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. Our results under GAAP are set forth in the financial statements following this press release.
