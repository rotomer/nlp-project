Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
March 1, 2004  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today announced it will recognize the loss related to the extinguishment of the tendered 9% and 9.5% Senior Notes (together "Senior Notes") in the first quarter of 2004, which will decrease its previously reported fourth quarter and full year 2003 net loss. The changes have no effect on site rental and broadcast transmission revenue, total revenue, adjusted EBITDA, net cash from operating activities, free cash flow (defined as cash from operating activities less capital expenditures) and 2004 outlook reported on February 18, 2004.
 
The revision will move the recognition of a loss on the extinguishment of tendered Senior Notes from the fourth quarter of 2003 to the first quarter of 2004. On December 5, 2003, Crown Castle announced cash tender offers for its Senior Notes. The tender offers for these notes expired on January 6, 2004 and Crown Castle paid for these notes on January 7, 2004. In its February 18, 2004 press release reporting fourth quarter and full year 2003 results, Crown Castle reported a loss of $122.8 million for the extinguishment of certain debt and preferred securities in the fourth quarter, inclusive of $22.5 million related to the extinguishment of the Senior Notes that had been irrevocably tendered as of December 31, 2003. Crown Castle's determination to record the loss of $22.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 was made in consultation and with the concurrence of KPMG LLP, its external auditor.
 
In conjunction with the preparation of Crown Castle's Form 10-K, Crown Castle, together with KPMG LLP, determined that it is appropriate to recognize the loss of $22.5 million on the extinguishment of such tendered Senior Notes in the first quarter of 2004. The effect of recognizing

the loss on the extinguishment of such tendered Senior Notes in the first quarter of 2004 will decrease the previously reported net loss by $22.5 million and the net loss per share by $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter of 2003. The Senior Notes tendered at December 31, 2003 remain classified as current maturities of long-term debt at year-end.
 
The revised net loss and net loss per share for fourth quarter and full year 2003 follows:
 
Net loss was $148.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, inclusive of $100.3 million in losses from the retirement of debt and preferred securities, compared to a net loss of $34.9 million for the same period in 2002, inclusive of $49.1 million of gains from the retirement of debt. Net loss after deduction of dividends on preferred stock was $158.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, inclusive of $100.3 million in losses from the retirement of debt and preferred securities, compared to a loss of $4.2 million for the same period last year, inclusive of $98.8 million in gains from the retirement of debt and preferred securities. Fourth quarter net loss per share was $(0.73) compared to a loss per share of $(0.02) in last year's fourth quarter of 2002. Prior to July 1, 2003, gains and losses from purchases of our 12

% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock were presented as part of dividends on preferred stock in our consolidated statement of operations. Since that date, such gains and losses are presented as part of interest and other income (expense) due to the adoption of a new accounting standard for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments.
 
Net loss for full year 2003 was $398.4 million, inclusive of $137.8 million in losses from the retirement of debt and preferred securities, compared to a net loss of $272.5 million for the same period in 2002, inclusive of $79.1 million of gains from the retirement of debt. Net loss after deduction of dividends on preferred stock was $452.3 million for the full year 2003, inclusive of $137.5 million in losses from the retirement of debt and preferred securities, compared to a loss of $252.9 million for the same period last year, inclusive of $178.6 million in gains from the retirement of debt and preferred securities. Full year 2003 net loss per share was $(2.09) compared to a loss per share of $(1.16) for full year 2002.
 
Crown Castle's outlook for first quarter and full year 2004 remains unchanged from the February 18, 2004 press release.

This press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on our management's current expectations. Such forward-looking statements include references to the Company's previously provided outlook. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including prevailing market conditions and other factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected. More information about potential risk factors which could affect our results is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
 
This press release includes presentations of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Crown Castle defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (both amounts from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows). Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, minority interests, provision for income taxes, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs and dividends on preferred stock, interest and other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion, non-cash general and administrative compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges (credits). Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles). Further, our measure of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Free Cash Flow is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of our ability to execute our business strategy without reliance on additional borrowing or the use of our cash and liquid investments. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of the current financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. Our results under GAAP are set forth in the financial statements following this press release.
 
 
Adjusted EBITDA is computed as follows
