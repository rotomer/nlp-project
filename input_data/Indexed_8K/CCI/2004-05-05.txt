Operating income improved to $26.7 million in the first quarter of 2004 from $11.8 million in the first quarter of 2003, an increase of $14.8 million.
 
Net loss was $65.0 million for the first quarter of 2004, inclusive of $24.4 million in losses from the retirement of debt securities, compared to a net loss of $69.0 million for the same period in 2003. Net loss after deduction of dividends on preferred stock was $74.7 million in the first quarter of 2004, inclusive of $24.4 million in losses from the retirement of debt securities, compared to a loss of $83.4 million for the same period last year, inclusive of $3.3 million in gains from the retirement of preferred securities. First quarter net loss per share was $(0.34) compared to a loss per share of $(0.38) in last year's first quarter.
 
Net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2004 improved $21.0 million to $26.9 million from $5.9 million for the same period last year. Free cash flow, defined as net cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, for the first quarter of 2004 improved $54.4 million, to a source of cash of $7.5 million from a use of cash of $46.9 million in the first quarter of 2003.

US site rental revenue for the first quarter of 2004 increased $12.8 million, or 11.9%, to $120.7 million, from $107.8 million for the same period in 2003, and UK site rental and broadcast transmission revenue for the first quarter of 2004 increased $19.3 million, or 27.1%, to $90.4

million, from $71.1 million for the same period in 2003. These revenue results approximate same tower sales as over 99% of Crown Castle's sites were in operation for the 12 months preceding March 31, 2004.
 
"During the first quarter, our core business continued to produce strong growth," stated John P. Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "Thus far during 2004, we have experienced a 25% increase in US leasing compared to last year's volume and we are encouraged by the leasing activity in the UK and Australia.
 
On a consolidated basis, site rental and broadcast transmission gross margin, defined as site rental and broadcast transmission revenue less site rental and broadcast transmission cost of operations, increased 22.2% to $136.4 million, up $24.8 million in the first quarter of 2004 from the same period in 2003. During the past 12 months, Crown Castle's operating results have benefited predominantly from organic growth and, in part, from the weakening US dollar relative to the currencies of its UK and Australian subsidiaries.
 
For the first quarter of 2004, US capital expenditures were $6.3 million and UK capital expenditures were $12.7 million. During the first quarter of 2004, Crown Castle developed 26 sites in the UK under our agreement with British Telecom.
 
"During the last four quarters, we have added approximately $100 million of annualized recurring tower gross margin," stated W. Benjamin Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "Most of this growth has occurred through the addition of revenue on our existing sites and managing our costs. We remain focused on producing meaningful growth in free cash flow per share through the combination of continued strong operational growth and balance sheet enhancements."
 
During the first quarter of 2004, Crown Castle repaid $15.0 million of its Crown Atlantic credit facility, bringing the remaining balance to $180.0 million. Crown Castle had approximately $574.0 million of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $171.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and total availability under its OpCo and Crown Atlantic credit facilities of approximately $402.5 million.
 
Also, during the first quarter of 2004, Crown Castle purchased $245.1 million of the face value of its 9% Senior Notes and 9% Senior Notes ("Senior Notes"), $135.6 million and $109.5 million, respectively, at a combined loss of $24.1 million. These purchases were related to the closing of previously announced tender offers for the Senior Notes in December 2003. Crown Castle also purchased $1.5 million of its 10?% Senior Discount Notes and $1.0 million of its 11% Senior Discount Notes ("Senior Discount Notes") at a combined loss of $0.2 million.

This press release includes presentations of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Crown Castle defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (both amounts from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows). Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, minority interests, provision for income taxes, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs and dividends on preferred stock, interest and other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion, non-cash general and administrative compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges (credits). Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles). Further, our measure of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Free Cash Flow is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of our ability to execute our business strategy without reliance on additional borrowing or the use of our cash and liquid investments. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of the current financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. Our results under GAAP are set forth in the financial statements following this press release.
