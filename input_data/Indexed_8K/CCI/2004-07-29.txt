July 28, 2004  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004. Results from Crown Castle's UK subsidiary have been classified as discontinued operations, pending the closing of the previously announced sale.
 
Site rental revenue for the second quarter of 2004 increased 12.7 percent to $131.4 million, up $14.8 million from $116.6 million for the same period in the prior year. Operating income improved to $3.5 million in the second quarter of 2004 from $(10.0) million in the second quarter of 2003, an increase of $13.5 million.
 
Net loss was $39.6 million for the second quarter of 2004 compared to a net loss of $80.8 million for the same period in 2003. Net loss after deduction of dividends on preferred stock was $48.9 million in the second quarter of 2004 compared to a loss of $100.9 million for the same period last year.

OPERATING RESULTS
 
US site rental revenue for the second quarter of 2004 increased $10.3 million, or 9.3 percent, to $120.8 million, from $110.5 million for the same period in 2003. US site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenue less site rental cost of operations, increased 13.0% to $82.5 million, up $9.5 million in the second quarter of 2004 from the same period in 2003. On a consolidated basis, site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenue less site rental cost of operations, increased 16.8% to $89.5 million, up $12.9 million in the second quarter of 2004 from the same period in 2003. These results approximate same tower sales and gross margin as over 99% of Crown Castle's sites were in operation for the 12 months preceding June 30, 2004.

"We are very pleased with the second quarter results and the growth we continue to see in our core business," stated John P. Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "In the past year, we have achieved $51.6 million growth in annualized recurring gross margin on $54.4 million of additional annualized recurring revenue, while total general and administrative costs have remained unchanged. Based on our signed leases to date and our expected leasing during the second half of the year, we expect US leasing to increase approximately 25% this year compared to last year."
 
Net cash from operating activities for the second quarter of 2004 was $35.2 million. Free cash flow, defined as net cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was a source of cash of $22.6 million for the second quarter of 2004. For the second quarter of 2004, total capital expenditures were $12.7 million, comprised of $3.5 million of maintenance capital expenditures and $9.2 million of revenue generating capital expenditures. Crown Castle had $232.5 million of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2004.
 
SALE OF UK SUBSIDIARY
 
On June 28, 2004, Crown Castle announced it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its UK subsidiary to National Grid Transco Plc for $2.035 billion in cash. Crown Castle will use approximately $1.3 billion of the proceeds from the transaction to fully repay Crown Castle Operating Company's credit facility. Crown Castle expects to use the remaining net proceeds of approximately $740 million to repay debt or to invest in new business opportunities in the US.
 
As a result of the announced transaction, Crown Castle's UK operations have been classified as discontinued operations. The closing date of the transaction, subject to certain approvals, is expected to be on or before September 30, 2004.
 
"We are continuing to proceed with closing the sale of the UK business," stated W. Benjamin Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "We are finalizing a refinancing plan for the new balance sheet that we are targeting will deliver significant interest expense savings by January 1, 2005."
 
OUTLOOK
 
The following statements and outlook table are based on current expectations and assumptions and assume a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.70 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollar. This Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to
Page 3 of 10
 
differ from the forward-looking statements herein are set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Crown Castle has increased its 2004 Outlook for Site Rental Revenue from between $524 million and $528 million to between $525 million and $530 million and Adjusted EBITDA from between $270 million and $280 million to between $280 million and $287 million. Based primarily on increased leasing activity, Crown Castle has raised its 2004 outlook for revenue generating capital expenditures from between $23 million and $30 million to between $33 million and $40 million.
 
The following table sets forth Crown Castle's current outlook for the third quarter and full year 2004 ():

The following table sets forth Crown Castle's current outlook for 2005 :
(dollars in millions)
 
 
The Outlook above does not include results from our UK subsidiary. Crown Castle has not issued 2004 Outlook for net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow because of the impact the timing of the expected closing of the sale of the UK subsidiary will have on 2004 interest expense. Crown Castle's 2005 Outlook for net cash provided by operating activities includes expected savings from interest expense reductions that may be achieved through refinancings and further debt reductions associated with the application of sales proceeds and cash

balances, and refinancings. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less all capital expenditures (both maintenance and revenue generating capital expenditures).

This press release includes presentations of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Crown Castle defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (both amounts from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows). Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, minority interests, provision for income taxes, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs and dividends on preferred stock, interest and other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion, non-cash general and administrative compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges (credits). Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles). Further, our measure of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Free Cash Flow is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of our ability to execute our business strategy without reliance on additional borrowing or the use of our cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of the current financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. Our results under GAAP are set forth in the financial statements following this press release.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
July 29, 2004  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) adjusted its previously reported site rental revenue upward by $1.2 million to $131.4 million and site rental cost of operations upward by $1.2 million to $41.8 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004. The adjustments correct a computational error Crown Castle discovered in the consolidating entries of its US operations.
 
The revised site rental revenue and site rental cost of operations for the second quarter of 2004 follows:
 
Consolidated site rental revenue for the second quarter of 2004 increased 12.7 percent to $131.4 million, up $14.8 million from $116.6 million for the same period in the prior year. Consolidated site rental cost of operations for the second quarter of 2004 was $41.8 million compared to $40.0 million for the same period in the prior year. US site rental revenue for the second quarter of 2004 increased $10.3 million, or 9.3 percent, to $120.8 million, from $110.5 million for the same period in 2003. US site rental cost of operations for the second quarter of 2004 was $38.3 million compared to $37.5 million for the same period in 2003.
 
The adjustments have no effect on any other previously reported second quarter 2004 numbers, including Adjusted EBITDA, net loss, net loss per share, cash provided by operating activities or Free Cash Flow, which is defined as cash from operating activities less capital expenditures. Crown Castle's outlook for third quarter 2004 and full years 2004 and 2005 remains unchanged from the July 28, 2004 press release.
