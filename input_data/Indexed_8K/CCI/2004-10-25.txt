This document includes "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Item 2.01, Item 9.01 and Exhibit 99.1 of the Form 8-K previously filed by Crown Castle International Corp. ("Company") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 7, 2004 are hereby amended as set forth below to reflect updated information relating to the sale of Crown Castle UK Holdings Limited ("CCUK"). After calculating the preliminary working capital type adjustments impacting the cash proceeds from the transaction, it was determined that CCUK's cash and cash equivalents should be reclassified to assets of discontinued operations in the Company's historical consolidated balance sheets.

In addition, certain other pro forma adjustments related to the CCUK sale have been updated, including the estimated sales proceeds amount, fees and expenses, compensation charges related to stock options and restricted stock awards held by CCUK employees, and the estimated alternative minimum tax liability.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is based on the historical financial statements of Crown Castle International Corp. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries (the "Company"), adjusted to give effect to the following transactions:
 
 
 
On June 28, 2004, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell CCUK to an affiliate of National Grid Transco Plc for $2.035 billion in cash, subject to certain working capital type adjustments. On August 31, 2004, the Company completed the sale of CCUK. The cash proceeds for the transaction amounted to approximately $2.028 billion, after taking into account preliminary working capital type adjustments. In accordance with the terms of the Company's 2000 Credit Facility, the Company was required to use approximately $1.3 billion of the proceeds from the transaction to fully repay the outstanding borrowings under the 2000 Credit Facility.
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations Information for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the six months ended June 30, 2004 give effect to these transactions as if they had occurred as of January 1, 2003. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet Information as of June 30, 2004 gives effect to these transactions as if they had been completed as of June 30, 2004. The pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes and are based upon available information and certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The Company's historical consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 presents CCUK's results of operations on a continuing operations basis, while the historical consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2004 presents CCUK's results of operations on a discontinued operations basis.

The pro forma financial information does not purport to represent what the Company's results of operations or financial condition would actually have been had these transactions in fact occurred on such dates or to project the Company's results of operations or financial condition for any future date or period. The pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
