OPERATING RESULTS
 
US site rental revenue for the third quarter of 2004 increased $11.9 million, or 10.5%, to $125.3 million, from $113.4 million for the same period in 2003. US site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenue less site rental cost of operations, increased 13.2% to $86.1 million, up $10.1 million in the third quarter of 2004 from the same period in 2003.
 
On a consolidated basis, site rental gross margin increased 14.8% to $91.9 million, up $11.8 million in the third quarter of 2004 from the same period in 2003. Both the US and consolidated results approximate same tower sales and gross margin as over 99% of Crown Castle's sites were in operation for the 12 months preceding June 30, 2004.
 
"We are very pleased with our company performance this quarter as we continue to complete over 25% more new tenant leases with our customers in 2004 than in 2003," stated John P. Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "As our customers focus on enhancing their wireless networks to meet consumer demand, we are diligently working to provide them rapid coverage and capacity solutions on our extensive portfolio of towers. Moreover, the company-transforming sale of our UK subsidiary that was completed during the quarter affords us the operational and financial flexibility to capitalize on the anticipated growth potential of the US market."
 
Net cash from operating activities for the third quarter of 2004 was $19.2 million. Free cash flow, defined as net cash from operating activities less capital expenditures, was a source of cash of $9.5 million for the third quarter of 2004. For the third quarter of 2004, total capital expenditures were $9.8 million, comprised of $1.6 million of maintenance capital expenditures and $8.2 million of revenue generating capital expenditures. Crown Castle had $908.5 million of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2004. During the third quarter, Crown Castle purchased approximately 2.7 million shares of its common stock using approximately $36.0 million in cash, an average of $13.49 per share.
 
SALE OF UK SUBSIDIARY
 
On August 31, 2004, Crown Castle completed the sale of its UK subsidiary to National Grid Transco Plc for approximately $2.0 billion in cash. Crown Castle used $1.3 billion of the proceeds from the transaction to fully repay Crown Castle Operating Company's credit facility. As a result of this transaction, Crown Castle's UK subsidiary is classified as discontinued operations in the financial results.
 
 
On September 10, 2004, Crown Castle announced cash tender offers for certain of its outstanding 9 3/8% Senior Notes, 10 3/4% Senior Notes, 7.5% Senior Notes and 7.5% Series B Senior Notes (collectively, "the Notes") in order to satisfy certain provisions of the Notes relating to the sale of its UK subsidiary. On October 8, 2004, Crown Castle retired $465,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Notes received during the tender period.
 
"After the closing of the sale of our UK subsidiary, we continue to focus on decreasing our cost of debt toward a target rate of approximately 6% and positioning Crown Castle to have the financial flexibility to utilize our internally generated capital for the highest yielding investments, including opportunistic share purchases, new assets and further investments in our existing assets," stated W. Benjamin Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "Further, we continue to evaluate opportunities to replace our higher coupon notes with new senior indebtedness, which we believe would come with much lower interest costs."

This press release includes presentations of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Crown Castle defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (both amounts from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows). Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income from discontinued operations, minority interests, provision for income taxes, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs and dividends on preferred stock, interest and other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion, non-cash general and administrative compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges (credits). Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles). Further, our measure of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Free Cash Flow is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of our ability to execute our business strategy without reliance on additional borrowing or the use of our cash and cash equivalents. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of the current financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. Our results under GAAP are set forth in the financial statements following this press release.
