Exhibit 99.1
 
 
The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is based on the historical financial statements of Crown Castle International Corp. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries (the "Company"), adjusted to give effect to the following transactions:
 
 
 
On June 28, 2004, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell CCUK to an affiliate of National Grid Transco Plc for $2.035 billion in cash, subject to certain working capital type adjustments. On August 31, 2004, the Company completed the sale of CCUK. The cash proceeds for the transaction amounted to approximately $2.028 billion, after taking into account preliminary working capital type adjustments. In accordance with the terms of the Company's 2000 Credit Facility, the Company was required to use approximately $1.3 billion of the proceeds from the transaction to fully repay the outstanding borrowings under the 2000 Credit Facility.
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations Information for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the nine months ended September 30, 2004 give effect to these transactions as if they had occurred as of January 1, 2003. The pro forma adjustments are described in the accompanying notes and are based upon available information and certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The Company's historical consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 presents CCUK's results of operations on a continuing operations basis, while the historical consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 presents CCUK's results of operations on a discontinued operations basis.
 
Included in the notes accompanying the pro forma financial information are tables summarizing the unaudited pro forma results of operations information for the Company and its subsidiaries that are restricted by covenants in our high yield debt instruments (the "Restricted Group"). These subsidiaries exclude Crown Atlantic and certain investment subsidiaries which are designated as unrestricted subsidiaries under our high yield debt instruments.
 
The pro forma financial information does not purport to represent what the Company's results of operations would actually have been had these transactions in fact occurred on such dates or to project the Company's results of operations for any future period. The pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in the Company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following tables summarize the unaudited pro forma results of operations information for the Restricted Group under our high yield debt instruments. Such information is not intended as an alternative measure of the operating results as would be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
