"We are pleased with the significant recurring revenue growth generated in 2004," stated John P. Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "US site rental revenue
 
 
increased approximately $4,100 per site over the past year to an annualized level of approximately $48,600 per site at year end. While our 2005 outlook is currently based on a lower level of new leasing activity than we achieved in 2004, we continue to see positive signs from our customers in the US, which may result in additional revenue. Further, as of January 1, 2005, more than 95% of Crown Castle's 2005 outlook for site rental revenue was under contract, demonstrating the inherent predictability of the tower business. I am very pleased with the degree to which we exceeded our original 2004 financial targets and look forward to further financial and operational accomplishments in 2005."
 
"We continue to focus our efforts on maximizing recurring cash flow per share and exploring opportunities to refinance a significant portion of our indebtedness," stated Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. "While there can be no assurances that we will be successful in completing any such refinancing, we continue to be optimistic that we can lower the average interest rate of our debt and increase the flexibility of our investment options through such a refinancing. If we are able to achieve a refinancing, we would expect to have increased flexibility to invest our cash flow in those investments that we believe will maximize returns to our shareholders, which may include the purchase of our own securities. We hope to complete these refinancing activities during the second quarter."
 
IMPACT OF LEASE ACCOUNTING CHANGES
 
As previously announced, Crown Castle reviewed certain non-cash items relating to its lease accounting practices as a result of a public letter issued by the SEC to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants on February 7, 2005 clarifying the interpretation of existing accounting literature applicable to certain leases and leasehold improvements. As a result of this review, Crown Castle adjusted its method of accounting for tenant leases, ground leases and depreciation. The corrections were non-cash adjustments resulting in increases to site rental revenue, ground rent expense (a component of site rental cost of operations) and depreciation expense. The adjustments did not affect historical or future cash flow or the timing of payments under related leases. Moreover, the corrections did not have any impact on cash balances, compliance with any financial covenant or debt instrument, or the current economic value of Crown Castle's leaseholds and its tower assets.
 
All prior period financial information discussed above has been restated to reflect the restatement. The net impacts of the changes in our lease accounting on site rental revenue, site
 
 
rental cost of operations and Adjusted EBITDA in 2003 and 2004 are set forth on the following tables* (in millions):
 
 
 
 
The impact of the changes in our lease accounting in our reported fourth quarter 2004 results, as compared to the methodology used to prepare our fourth quarter 2004 Outlook, was an increase of $1.8 million in site rental revenue ($0.8 million in the US and $1.0 million in Australia), an increase of $3.8 million in site rental cost of operations ($3.4 million in the US and $0.4 million in Australia) and a net decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $2.0 million.
 
SUMMARY OF NON-CASH AMOUNTS IN TOWER GROSS MARGIN
 
In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we recognize site rental revenues and ground lease expenses monthly on a straight-line basis, regardless of whether the receipts and payments are in equal monthly amounts. Some agreements provide for rent-free periods at the beginning of the lease term, while others call for rent to be prepaid for some period. If the
 
 
payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate lease term. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue and expense recognized in a given period represents cash collected or paid in other periods.
 
A summary of the non-cash portions of our site rental revenues, ground lease expense and resulting impact on our site rental gross margins is as follows:

This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
 
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income from discontinued operations, minority interests, provision for income taxes, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs and dividends on preferred stock, interest and other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion, non-cash general and administrative compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges (credits). Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)). Adjusted EBITDA is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of the current financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations.
 
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. Sustaining capital expenditures are defined as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or term of an asset. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Recurring cash flow is provided as additional information because management believes it to be useful in providing investors with a reasonable estimate of our cash flow available for discretionary investments (including expansion projects, improvements to existing sites, debt repayment, securities purchases and dividends) without reliance on additional borrowing or the use of our cash and cash equivalents.
 
Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
