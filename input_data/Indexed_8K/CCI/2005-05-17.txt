MAY 17, 2005  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE: CCI) announced today that certain of its indirect subsidiaries intend to offer, in a private transaction, up to $1.9 billion of Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2005-1. The issuing subsidiaries will be special purpose entities that hold substantially all of the U.S. towers of Crown Castle. Crown Castle expects that the notes will be rated investment grade. The offering is being structured as an issuance of debt securities, the servicing and repayment of which is expected to be made solely from the cash flow from the operation of the U.S. towers that are part of the transaction. The terms of the securities are expected to allow excess cash flow from the operation of the towers to be available to Crown Castle for general corporate purposes.
 
Crown Castle expects to use the net proceeds received from this offering to tender for all of its outstanding 10
