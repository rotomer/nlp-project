On July 27, 2005, Crown Castle Operating Company ("CCOC"), a subsidiary of Crown Castle International Corp. ("Company"), entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks ("Credit Facility"), pursuant to which such banks agreed to provide CCOC with a $275,000,000 senior secured revolving line of credit.
 
The Credit Facility is secured by a pledge of all the outstanding common shares of Crown Castle Towers 05 LLC, a newly formed acquisition subsidiary, and 66% of all the outstanding equity interests of Crown Castle Australia Holdings Pty Ltd, as well as a security interest in CCOC's deposit accounts and securities accounts. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Company and certain of its existing and future subsidiaries (collectively, the "Guarantors").
 
The Credit Facility will be used to fund CCOC's ongoing working capital needs and for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of capital expenditures, acquisitions and equity repurchases by the Company. Availability under the Credit Facility at any time will be determined by reference to a financial ratio related to net cash flow and interest expense relating to specified Crown Castle towers. The proceeds of the initial borrowings under the Credit Facility were used to finance a portion of Crown Castle Towers 05 LLC's acquisition of assets of certain subsidiaries of TrinTel Communications, Inc.
 
The Credit Facility matures on July 26, 2006. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum, at CCOC's election, equal to the prime rate of KeyBank National Association plus 0.50% or LIBOR plus 2.375%. The interest rate margins for LIBOR loans may be reduced or increased by 0.375% (non-cumulatively) based on a financial test that will be calculated monthly. Interest on prime rate loans is due monthly, while interest on LIBOR loans is due at the end of the interest period (one, two, three or six months) for which such LIBOR rate is in effect.
 
The Credit Facility requires CCOC to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants and places certain restrictions on CCOC's and the Guarantors' ability to, among other things, incur debt and liens, pay dividends, make capital expenditures, dispose of assets, undertake transactions with affiliates and make investments.
 
The Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other indebtedness (including defaults under the Indenture between Crown Castle Towers LLC, Crown Castle South LLC, Crown Communication Inc., Crown Castle PT Inc., Crown Communication New York, Inc. and Crown Castle International Corp. de Puerto Rico, as Issuers, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Indenture Trustee, dated as of June 1, 2005), and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency.
 
The above summary of the Credit Facility is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms and provisions of the Credit Facility filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1.

reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital (or on the capital of such Lender's holding company) as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender (or its holding company) could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's policies or the policies of its holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount which such Lender deems to be material, then from time to time, within ten days after demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender (or its holding company) for such reduction. A certificate of such Lender claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Failure on the part of any Lender to demand compensation for any reduction in return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's rights to demand compensation for any reduction in return on capital in such period or in any other period. The protection of this Section shall be available to each Lender regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, regulation or other condition which shall have been imposed.

Termination
 
(a) This Agreement shall terminate when all amounts due hereunder, under each Note and under each Loan Document shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash and all other Obligations hereunder or thereunder shall have been fully performed, so long as the
 
Lenders have no further obligation to advance sums hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated and relate back to such time as though this Agreement had always been in effect, as the case may be, if at any time any amount received by the Agent or any Lender in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by such Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any Consolidated Party or any other Person or upon the appointment of any intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar official for, any Consolidated Party or any other Person or any substantial part of its properties, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

All calculations made to compute the rate of interest that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received under any Note payable to any Lender or under this Agreement or under any Loan Document or otherwise in connection with such Note for the purpose of determining whether such rate exceeds the maximum amount allowed by law applicable to such Lender shall be made, to the extent permitted by such applicable law, by amortizing, prorating, and spreading in equal parts during the period of the full stated term of the Loan or Loans evidenced by such Note all interest at any time contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received by such Lender in connection therewith.

August 2, 2005  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2005 and announced the completion of a $275 million revolving credit facility.
 
Site rental revenue for the second quarter of 2005 increased $14.4 million, or 10.8%, to $146.9 million from $132.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenue less site rental cost of operations, increased 14.1% to $99.1 million, up $12.2 million in the second quarter of 2005 from the same period in 2004. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2005 increased $11.1 millionor 15.5%, to $82.6 million, up from $71.5 million for the same period in 2004.
,
 
Recurring cash flow, defined as Adjusted EBITDA less interest expense less sustaining capital expenditures, was $44.5 million for the second quarter of 2005, compared to $11.4 million for the second quarter of 2004. Recurring cash flow per share, defined as recurring cash flow divided by common shares outstanding, was $0.20 in the second quarter of 2005 compared to $0.05 in the second quarter of 2004.
 
As previously announced during the second quarter, Crown Castle refinanced virtually all of its outstanding indebtedness at a lower interest rate, retiring $1.4 billion of its high yield notes. Net loss was ($227.5) million for the second quarter of 2005, inclusive of $198.5 million in losses from the early retirement of debt, compared to a net loss of ($50.8) million for the same period in 2004.

of $0.91 per share losses from the early retirement of debt, compared to a net loss per share of $(0.27) in last year's second quarter.
 
OPERATING RESULTS
 
US site rental revenue for the second quarter of 2005 increased $12.5 millionor 10.3%, to $133.5 million, compared to second quarter 2004 US site rental revenue of $121.0 million. US site rental gross margin increased 13.8% to $90.3 million, up $10.9 million in the second quarter of 2005 from the same period in 2004.
,
 
Australia site rental revenue for the second quarter of 2005 increased $1.8 million, or 15.8%, to $13.3 million, up from $11.5 million for the same period in 2004. Australia site rental gross margin increased 17.7% to $8.9 million, up $1.3 million in the second quarter of 2005 from the same period in 2004. In both the second quarter of 2004 and 2005, Australia site rental revenue and site rental gross margin benefited by approximately $2 million from an annual customer contractual payment.
 
"We are very pleased with the growth we continue to see in our core business reflected in our strong second quarter results," stated John P. Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "Comparing the second quarter 2004 to second quarter 2005, we have achieved $48.8 million growth in annualized site rental gross margin on $57.4 million of additional annualized site rental revenue. The growth in our core business coupled with annualized interest expense savings of $84.7 million, which we've achieved through various refinancings over the last year, resulted in annualized recurring cash flow growth of $132.4 million. Our tower leasing business is benefiting from the addition of new tenants to our existing tower portfolio caused by the continued growth in wireless minutes and introduction of new data services by wireless carriers in the US and Australia. Further, we expect to see similar to slightly higher levels of leasing activity in the second half of 2005 as we saw in the first half."
 
INVESTMENTS
 
During the second quarter of 2005, Crown Castle invested $231.8 million in capital expenditures and the purchase of its equity and convertible securities. During the quarter, Crown Castle purchased approximately 10.4 million shares of its common stock using approximately $175.8 million in cash, an average of $16.94 per share, and utilized $43.7 million in cash to retire $24.6 million of face value of its 4% Convertible Notes (convertible to common shares at $10.83 per share), reducing potential shares outstanding by 2.3 million. Common shares outstanding

basic and diluted  were 215.8 million on June 30, 2005. Also during the second quarter of 2005, Crown Castle spent $12.3 million on capital expenditures, comprised of $2.7 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $9.6 million of revenue generating capital expenditures.
 
On July 12, 2005, Crown Castle announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 467 towers from TrinTel Communications, Inc. ("TrinTel"), based in Irving, Texas, for approximately $145 million in cash. Crown Castle's acquisition of the TrinTel towers closed August 1, 2005. TrinTel's portfolio currently produces approximately $14 million in annualized site rental revenue, over 98% of which is derived from wireless telephony tenants, and approximately $9 million in annualized site rental gross margin. The towers were built between 1998 and 2001, with an average age of 4.7 years, and are primarily located in key US markets, such as Dallas-Fort Worth and Detroit. Crown Castle funded the acquisition entirely through borrowings under its new credit facility (described below).
 
Also on July 12, 2005, Crown Castle announced it had made an additional investment of $55 million in FiberTower Corporation ("FiberTower"), a privately-held provider of backhaul services. FiberTower designs, deploys and operates radio-based backhaul networks for major wireless carriers. Crown Castle retains approximately 32%, on a fully diluted basis, of FiberTower and remains FiberTower's largest shareholder. As part of Crown Castle's investment, FiberTower raised a total of $150 million through an equity offering, with investments from several prominent private equity firms.
 
BALANCE SHEET IMPROVEMENTS
 
On June 8, 2005, Crown Castle completed the sale of $1.9 billion of Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2005-1 ("Notes"), issued by an indirect US subsidiary. The Notes consist of five classes, which are all rated investment grade. The weighted average interest rate on the various classes of Notes is approximately 4.89%, entirely on a fixed interest rate basis.
 
Crown Castle used most of the net proceeds received from the Notes to fund the purchase of its 10 3/4% Senior Notes, 9 3/8% Senior Notes, 7.5% Senior Notes and 7.5% Series B Senior Notes, to repay its outstanding Crown Castle Atlantic credit facility, and to fund the redemption of its outstanding 9% Senior Notes, 9 1/2% Senior Notes, 10 3/8% Senior Discount Notes and 11 1/4% Senior Discount Notes. The balance of the net proceeds is expected to be used for general corporate purposes.
 
The Notes provide Crown Castle with the flexibility to use cash flow generated by its subsidiaries after debt service for any corporate purpose, subject to certain restrictions. As a result,

Crown Castle may invest in tower acquisitions, tower builds, common stock repurchases, dividends or other investments it deems attractive without the significant limitations that previously existed under its high-yield notes.
 
In addition, the Notes allow, subject to certain conditions, for the issuance of additional notes based on increases in cash flow from growth on the existing tower assets and from newly acquired or built tower sites.
 
Further, on August 1, 2005, Crown Castle completed a $275 million revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, common stock purchases and dividends. Under the terms of the facility, Crown Castle may use up to $100 million of borrowings for stock purchases and dividends. Borrowings under the facility will bear interest at a rate per annum of 200 to 275 basis points (based on interest expense coverage) plus LIBOR.
 
KeyBank National Association and Calyon New York Branch were the co-lead arrangers of the credit facility. Royal Bank of Scotland was the documentation agent of the credit facility. The syndicate of lenders also included Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers.
 
"We are very excited to have completed a number of important milestones during the last several months," stated Ben Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "The $1.9 billion Notes offering, the completion of the $275 million revolving credit facility and the elimination of nearly all of our outstanding high-yield notes contributed to a vastly simplified, cheaper and more flexible capital structure. We have eliminated virtually all restrictions on the use of cash generated by our business after debt service, significantly reduced our annual interest expense and created an ongoing borrowing mechanism that should enable us to lever the growth that we expect in our business. As evidenced by the significant investments in our common stock and the acquisition of the TrinTel towers, our recent financing activities position Crown Castle to continue to make investments that drive recurring cash flow per share. We remain focused on our long-term goal of 20% to 25% annual growth in recurring cash flow per share through the expected growth in our core tower business and related investments."

Crown Castle incurs non-cash compensation charges related to the issuance of restricted stock and stock options to certain employees and executives. Beginning in the first quarter of 2005 and in accordance with the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Crown Castle is classifying all non-cash compensation as components of cost of operations and general and administrative costs. In prior periods, Crown Castle had shown non-cash compensation as a separate line-item on its income statement. Prior period amounts of non-cash compensation have been reclassified for comparison purposes.
 
In January 2005, Crown Castle adopted a plan to sell OpenCell, a small subsidiary that manufactures distributed antenna system equipment. As a result, Crown Castle has restated its financial statements to present the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of OpenCell as amounts from discontinued operations. Such restatements have been made for all periods presented.
 
 
In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Crown Castle recognizes site rental revenues and ground lease expenses monthly on a straight-line basis, regardless of whether the receipts and payments are in equal monthly amounts. An agreement, related to an acquisition in Australia, provides the seller with a rent-free period at the beginning of the lease term, and other agreements call for rent to be prepaid for a specified period. If, and to the extent the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate lease term. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue and expense recognized in a given period represents cash collected or paid in other periods.
 
A summary of the non-cash portions of our site rental revenues, ground lease expense and resulting impact on site rental gross margins is as follows:
 
 
 
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
 
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, minority interests, credit (provision) for income taxes, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, interest and other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion, operating non-cash compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges (credits). Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)). Adjusted EBITDA is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of the current financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations.
 
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. Sustaining capital

expenditures are defined as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or term of an asset. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Recurring cash flow is provided as additional information because management believes it to be useful in providing investors with a reasonable estimate of our cash flow available for discretionary investments (including expansion projects, improvements to existing sites, debt repayment, securities purchases and dividends) without reliance on additional borrowing or the use of our cash and cash equivalents.
 
Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
