Net loss was $28.1 million for the third quarter of 2005, inclusive of a $2.7 million loss from the retirement of debt, compared to a net income of $450.7 million for last year's third quarter, inclusive of $509.1 million of income from discontinued operations and a $13.9 million loss from the retirement of debt.

Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "We remain focused on maximizing recurring cash flow per share as we believe it is the best measure of shareholder value. On the operational side, we are very pleased with the amount of new recurring revenue in the third quarter, as we added more tenants to our towers than we had forecasted."

INVESTMENTS
 
During the third quarter of 2005, Crown Castle invested $129.4 million in capital expenditures and purchases of its common stock. During the quarter, Crown Castle purchased approximately 4.7 million shares of its common stock using approximately $112.5 million in cash, an average of $23.98 per share. Common shares outstanding  basic and diluted  were 213.4 million on September 30, 2005. During the third quarter of 2005, Crown Castle spent $16.9 million on capital expenditures, comprised of $3.5 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $13.4 million of revenue generating capital expenditures, of which $5.5 million was spent on existing sites, $2.9 million on land purchases and $5.0 million on the construction of new sites.
 
Also, as previously announced, during the third quarter, Crown Castle acquired 467 towers from TrinTel Communications, Inc. ("TrinTel") for approximately $145 million in cash. The acquired
 
 
TrinTel portfolio currently produces approximately $14 million in annualized site rental revenue and approximately $9 million in annualized site rental gross margin. Further, Crown Castle made an additional investment of $55 million in FiberTower Corporation ("FiberTower"), as part of a total of $150 million that FiberTower raised through an equity offering. Crown Castle retains approximately 32%, on a fully diluted basis, of FiberTower and remains FiberTower's largest shareholder.
 
"We continue to invest our cash in investments that we believe will maximize long-term recurring cash flow per share," stated Ben Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "Over the last 12 months, we have invested nearly $600 million in the purchase of our common shares and 4% Convertible Notes representing shares that were in the money. These investments will have a compounding long-term impact on recurring cash flow per share as the revenues and resulting cash flow that we expect to produce will now be spread among fewer common shares outstanding. Based on our current run-rates and outlook for 2006, we expect we will invest over $100 million per quarter in a combination of capital expenditures on our existing towers, the acquisition and construction of new towers, and the purchase of our common shares. We remain focused on our long-term goal of 20% to 25% annual growth in recurring cash flow per share through the expected growth in our core tower business and related investments."
 
On August 1, 2005, Crown Castle completed a $275 million revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, common stock purchases and dividends. Under the terms of the facility, Crown Castle may use up to $100 million of borrowings for stock purchases and dividends. Borrowings under the facility will bear interest at a rate per annum of 200 to 275 basis points (based on interest expense coverage) plus LIBOR. Crown Castle currently has $145 million drawn under the credit facility, which was used to fund the Trintel acquisition.
 
OUTLOOK

Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein is set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The following table sets forth Crown Castle's current outlook for full year 2006:
 
 
Crown Castle has not provided outlook for 2006 capital expenditures, except for sustaining capital expenditures. Crown Castle expects to invest approximately $450 million to $500 million during 2006, which it expects to fund from recurring cash flow and borrowings of five to seven times its expected growth in Adjusted EBITDA. These investments are likely to consist of capital expenditures on existing towers, the purchase of land beneath existing towers, the construction of
 
 
new towers, the acquisition of towers, the purchase of common stock, and the redemption of the 8

% Convertible Preferred Stock that would eliminate potential share dilution. Crown Castle's 2006 Outlook for interest expense does not include the impact of potential borrowings.

Crown Castle incurs non-cash compensation charges related to the issuance of restricted stock and stock options to certain employees and executives. Beginning in the first quarter of 2005 and in accordance with the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Crown Castle is classifying all non-cash compensation as components of cost of operations and general and administrative costs. In prior periods, Crown Castle had shown non-cash compensation as a separate line-item on its income statement. Prior period amounts of non-cash compensation have been reclassified for comparison purposes.
 
 
In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Crown Castle recognizes site rental revenues and ground lease expenses monthly on a straight-line basis, regardless of whether the receipts and payments are in equal monthly amounts. An agreement, related to an acquisition in Australia, provides the seller with a rent-free period at the beginning of the lease term, and other agreements call for rent to be prepaid for a specified period. If, and to the extent the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate lease term. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue and expense recognized in a given period represents cash collected or paid in other periods.
 
 
A summary of the non-cash portions of our site rental revenues, ground lease expense and resulting impact on site rental gross margins is as follows:
 
 
 
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
 
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, minority interests, credit (provision) for income taxes, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, interest and other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion, operating non-cash compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges (credits). Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)). Adjusted EBITDA is presented as additional information because management believes it to be a useful indicator of the current financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations.
 
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. Sustaining capital expenditures are defined as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or term of an asset. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Recurring cash flow is provided as additional information because management believes it to be useful in providing investors with a reasonable estimate of our cash flow available for discretionary investments (including expansion projects, improvements to existing sites, debt repayment, securities purchases and dividends) without reliance on additional borrowing or the use of our cash and cash equivalents.
 
Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
