INVESTMENTS
During the fourth quarter of 2005, Crown Castle invested approximately $251.8 million in capital expenditures and purchases of its common shares and 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock. During the quarter, Crown Castle purchased approximately 0.9 million shares of its common stock using $21.8 million in cash at an average price of $24.72. On December 16, 2005, Crown Castle exercised its redemption right to purchase its 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock, which had a conversion price of $26.875, using approximately $204 million in cash, thereby removing the potential dilution of 7.44 million shares, or 3.5% of common shares outstanding. Common shares outstanding  basic and diluted  were 214.1 million on December 31, 2005.
Also, during the fourth quarter of 2005, Crown Castle spent $25.9 million on capital expenditures, comprised of $4.4 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $21.5 million of revenue generating capital expenditures, of which $8.8 million was spent on existing sites, $5.8 million on land purchases and $6.9 million on the construction of new sites.
"In 2005, we invested approximately $310 million to purchase approximately 16 million common shares and approximately $423 million to eliminate the potential dilution of 18.3 million shares from our 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock and 4% Convertible Notes," stated Ben Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "We believe these purchases of current and potential shares outstanding were the highest and best use of our capital and will positively impact long-term recurring cash flow per share growth. In 2006, we will strive to continue to make prudent capital investments through the purchase or construction of towers, improvements to our existing towers and the purchase of our common shares. We plan to consistently evaluate our potential capital investments based on their expected impact to long-term recurring cash flow per share, and we remain focused on our long-term goal of growing recurring cash flow per share by 20% to 25%."

On November 30, 2005, Crown Castle announced it had amended and increased its revolving credit facility from $275 million to $325 million. The outstanding amount of the revolving credit facility was $295 million at December 31, 2005.
NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS
As previously announced on February 13, 2006, Crown Castle determined that certain non-cash adjustments should be recorded primarily related to errors in its lease accounting practices. The non-cash adjustments resulted in a net aggregate $19.0 million improvement in net income (loss) for historical periods prior to October 1, 2005, comprised of a decrease in site rental revenue of $0.7 million, a decrease in ground rent expense (a component of site rental costs of operations) of $12.1 million, an increase in non-cash compensation expense (included in general and administrative expenses) of $0.8 million, a decrease in depreciation expense of $12.1 million, and a decrease in minority interest of $3.7 million. The adjustments do not affect cash flow or the timing of lease payments.
All prior period financial information discussed in this release has been restated to reflect the non-cash adjustments. The net impacts of the changes in our lease accounting on site rental revenues, site rental costs of operations and Adjusted EBITDA in 2004 and 2005 are set forth on the following tables* (in millions):

Crown Castle incurs non-cash compensation charges related to the issuance of restricted stock and stock options to certain employees and executives. Beginning in the first quarter of 2005 and in accordance with the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Crown Castle began classifying all non-cash compensation as components of cost of operations and general and administrative costs. In prior periods, Crown Castle had shown non-cash compensation as a separate line-item on its income statement. Prior period amounts of non-cash compensation have been reclassified for comparison purposes.
The Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 47, , on December 31, 2005. SFAS 143 requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. The types of asset retirement obligations that are covered by FIN 47 are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity, but the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The adoption of FIN 47 resulted in the recognition of liabilities of $14.1 million for contingent retirement obligations under certain tower site land leases (included in other long-term liabilities), asset retirement costs of $5.1 million (included in property and equipment), and the recognition of a charge for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of $9.0 million.
Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143
In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Crown Castle recognizes site rental revenues and ground lease expenses monthly on a straight-line basis, regardless of whether the receipts and payments are in equal monthly amounts. An agreement, related to an acquisition in Australia, provides the seller with a rent-free period at the beginning of the lease term, and other agreements call for rent to be prepaid for a specified period. If, and to the extent the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate lease term. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue and expense recognized in a given period represents cash collected or paid in other periods.
A summary of the non-cash portions of our site rental revenues, ground lease expense and resulting impact on site rental gross margins is as follows:

This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, minority interests, (provision) for income taxes, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, interest and other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion, operating non-cash compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges (credits). Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. Sustaining capital expenditures are defined as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or term of an asset. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
