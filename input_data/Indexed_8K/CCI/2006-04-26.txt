FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 26, 2006  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
Site rental revenue for the first quarter of 2006 increased $20.4 million, or 14.4%, to $161.9 million from $141.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenue less site rental cost of operations, increased 20.5% to $112.2 million, up $19.1 million in the first quarter of 2006 from the same period in 2005. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2006 increased $20.4 millionor 26.7%, to $96.9 million, up from $76.4 million for the same period in 2005.
,
Recurring cash flow, defined as Adjusted EBITDA less interest expense less sustaining capital expenditures, increased 84.4% to $62.7 million for the first quarter of 2006, compared to $34.0 million for the first quarter of 2005. Weighted average common shares outstanding decreased to 214.5 million for the first quarter of 2006 from 223.6 million for the same period in the prior year. Recurring cash flow per share, defined as recurring cash flow divided by weighted average common shares outstanding, improved by 93.3% to $0.29 in the first quarter of 2006 compared to $0.15 in the first quarter of 2005.
Net loss was $6.7 million for the first quarter of 2006, inclusive of $5.7 million of income from discontinued operations, compared to a net loss of $126.9 million for the same period in 2005, inclusive of $82.6 million of losses from the early retirement of debt. Net loss after deduction of dividends on preferred stock was $11.9 million in the first quarter of 2006, inclusive of $5.7 million of income from discontinued operations, compared to a loss of $136.6 million for the same period last year, inclusive of $82.6 million of losses from the early retirement of debt. First quarter 2006 net loss per share was $(0.06), compared to a net loss per share of $(0.61) in last year's first quarter.
 
"We had an excellent first quarter, exceeding the outlook that we provided for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow," stated John P. Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "Our US wireless carrier customers continue to enhance their voice and data offerings by adding equipment to our US towers at a rate higher than we previously expected. We also continue to see significant tenant activity in Australia and expect 2006 Adjusted EBITDA growth in our Australia subsidiary to be approximately 30%. Our consolidated results in the first quarter continue to reflect the attractive operating leverage of our business model as all of the growth in site rental revenue was converted to Adjusted EBITDA. Further, we have increased Adjusted EBITDA over the last twelve months by 27% while at the same time reducing weighted average shares outstanding by 4%, which is driving significant recurring cash flow per share growth."
The prior year amounts included in this release have been restated, as discussed in Crown Castle's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005.
SEGMENT RESULTS
US site rental revenue for the first quarter of 2006 increased $18.8 millionor 14.4%, to $150.1 million, compared to first quarter 2005 US site rental revenue of $131.3 million. US site rental gross margin increased 19.7% to $104.8 million, up $17.2 million in the first quarter of 2006 from the same period in 2005.
,
Australia site rental revenue for the first quarter of 2006 increased $1.5 million, or 15.1%, to $11.8 million, up from $10.2 million for the same period in 2005. Australia site rental gross margin increased 37.0% to $7.6 million, up $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2006 from the same period in 2005.
INVESTMENTS
During the first quarter of 2006, Crown Castle invested $25.1 million in common stock purchases and capital expenditures. During the quarter, Crown Castle purchased 0.1 million shares using $3.0 million in cash at an average price of $30.30 per share. Also, during the first quarter, total capital expenditures were $22.1 million, comprised of $1.9 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $20.2 million of revenue generating capital expenditures, of which $8.0 million was spent on
 
existing sites, $4.6 million on land purchases and $7.6 million on the construction of new sites. In addition, after the end of the first quarter, from April 1, 2006 to April 26, 2006, Crown Castle purchased 1.6 million shares using $47.7 million in cash at an average price of $29.47 per share. Since January 1, 2005, Crown Castle has invested $783.9 million in purchases of its securities to reduce fully diluted common shares by 36 million shares.
"We continue to invest in activities that we believe will maximize long-term recurring cash flow per share," stated Ben Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "In the last three months, we invested approximately $50.8 million, representing 81% of first quarter 2006 recurring cash flow, by purchasing 1.7 million shares of our common stock. Given the Adjusted EBITDA growth over the last several quarters, our debt to annualized first quarter Adjusted EBITDA ratio has declined to 5.9 times since we completed our $1.9 billion Tower Revenue Notes offering. We have started to work on alternatives to raise additional debt that we believe will move us back to the top end of our leverage target of five to seven times annualized Adjusted EBITDA. Based on the outlook provided in this press release, the combination of recurring cash flow and the additional debt resulting from levering the growth in Adjusted EBITDA is expected to create approximately $600 million of capital to invest during the balance of 2006 that we expect will be invested in a blend of tower improvements and builds, tower acquisitions and stock purchases. As reflected in the outlook provided, we believe we will be able to translate the anticipated revenue growth into recurring cash flow per share growth of nearly 35% for full year 2006 compared to 2005, based on the current share count."
OUTLOOK
The following outlook tables are based on current expectations and assumptions and assume a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.735 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollars. This Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein is set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
As reflected in the following tables, Crown Castle has increased the midpoint of its 2006 Outlook, previously issued on February 28, 2006, for site rental revenue by $5 million, site rental gross margin by $5 million, Adjusted EBITDA by $10 million and recurring cash flow by $10 million. The second quarter 2006 outlook contains an expected increase in US site rental cost of
 
operations by approximately $2 million as compared to the first quarter of 2006, due primarily to seasonal repair and maintenance expense and an increase in Australia site rental revenue from a payment of approximately $2 million related to an agreement with one of its customers.
The following tables set forth Crown Castle's current outlook:

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Crown Castle recognizes site rental revenues and ground lease expenses monthly on a straight-line basis, regardless of whether the receipts and payments are in equal monthly amounts. An agreement, related to an acquisition in Australia, provides the seller with a rent-free period at the beginning of the lease term, and other agreements call for rent to be prepaid for a specified period. If, and to the extent the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate lease term. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue and expense recognized in a given period represents cash collected or paid in other periods.
A summary of the non-cash portions of our site rental revenue, ground lease expense and resulting impact on site rental gross margins is as follows:
 
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, minority interests, credit (provision) for income taxes, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, interest and other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion, operating stock-based compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges (credits). Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. Sustaining capital expenditures are defined as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or term of an asset. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
