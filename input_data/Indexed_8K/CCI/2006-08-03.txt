Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2006 increased $21.3 millionor 25.9%, to $103.8 million, up from $82.5 million for the same period in 2005.

Weighted average common shares outstanding decreased to 212.7 million for the second quarter of 2006 from 218.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Recurring cash flow per share, defined as recurring cash flow divided by weighted average common shares outstanding, improved by 48.2% to $0.30 in the second quarter of 2006 compared to $0.20 in the second quarter of 2005.
Net loss was $13.3 million for the second quarter of 2006, compared to a net loss of $225.8 million for the same period in 2005, inclusive of $198.5 million in losses from the early retirement of debt.

"We had another excellent quarter of performance as we exceeded our previously provided Outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow," stated John P. Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "During the last four quarters, we have increased annualized site rental revenue by $87.0 million and increased annualized Adjusted EBITDA by $85.4 million. As we enter the second half of 2006, our strong growth in site rental revenue continues to be driven by the robust enhancements wireless carriers are making to their voice and data networks by adding equipment to our towers. Further, as we continue to optimize our balance sheet and control our operating costs, we are focused on converting a high percentage of our expected growth in site rental revenue into recurring cash flow per share."
The prior year amounts included in this release have been restated as discussed in Crown Castle's Annual Report or Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005.

For the second quarter 2006, total capital expenditures were $27.2 million, comprised of $2.3 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $24.9 million of revenue generating capital expenditures, of which $9.3 million was spent on existing sites, $4.2 million on land purchases and $11.4 million on the construction of new sites. In addition, after the end of the second quarter, in July 2006, Crown Castle
 
 
purchased 5.2 million of its common shares using $177.9 million in cash at an average price of $34.22 per share. Pro forma for the common shares purchased in July 2006, common shares outstanding at June 30, 2006 were 200.3 million.
During 2006, Crown Castle has purchased 15.9 million of its common shares using $518.0 million in cash to reduce common shares outstanding by approximately 7%. Since January 1, 2003, Crown Castle has invested over $1.4 billion in purchases of its securities to reduce fully diluted common shares by approximately 66 million shares.
On July 3, 2006, Crown Castle acquired over 98% of the outstanding equity interest of Mountain Union Telecom for approximately $305 million and will have the right to call the remaining equity interest for approximately $5 million commencing in 2007. At closing, Mountain Union's assets included 474 completed towers and 77 towers in various stages of development.
BALANCE SHEET
On June 1, 2006, Crown Castle announced the completion of a $1.25 billion credit facility, comprised of a $1 billion term loan ("Term Loan") and a $250 million revolving credit facility ("Revolver"). The proceeds of Term Loan were used in part to repay Crown Castle's previously existing $295 million credit facility and to acquire Mountain Union Telecom. The balance of the Term Loan proceeds was available for general corporate purposes, including purchases of Crown Castle common shares. At August 3, 2006, total availability under the Revolver was $250 million.
On August 1, 2006, Crown Castle redeemed its 10 3/4% and 9 3/8% Senior Notes, which had approximately $10.0 million and $1.7 million outstanding, respectively, at June 30, 2006, for approximately $12.3 million including accrued interest.
"Thus far in 2006, we have invested approximately $518.0 million to purchase approximately 15.9 million of our common shares and approximately $305 million to acquire 474 completed towers and 77 towers in development," stated Ben Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "We believe these purchases of shares and the acquisition of additional towers were the highest and best use of our capital and will positively impact long-term recurring cash flow per share growth. We continue to strive to make prudent capital investments through the purchase or construction of towers, improvements to our existing towers and the purchase of our common shares. As evidenced by our most recently completed credit facility and share purchases, we are focused on maintaining an appropriate level of debt leverage and making investments that we believe will grow long-term recurring cash flow per share. As we've discussed previously, we evaluate our potential capital
 
 
investments based on their expected impact to long-term recurring cash flow per share as we remain focused on our long-term goal of growing recurring cash flow per share by 20% to 25% per year."
REVIEW OF NON-CASH EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION
Crown Castle received a letter dated July 17, 2006, from the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") stating that the SEC is conducting an informal inquiry into various accounting matters related to Crown Castle, including whether grants of stock options may have been backdated. The SEC's letter states that it should not be construed as an indication by the SEC or its staff that any violations of law have occurred. Crown Castle intends to cooperate fully with the SEC in this matter.
Crown Castle has initiated a voluntary internal review of its equity-based compensation practices, including a review of its underlying stock option and restricted stock grant documentation and procedures and related accounting. During its preliminary review, Crown Castle has found no instances of inappropriate actions relating to the administration of its equity-based compensation plans and, further, that grants were made under its equity-based plans and approved by the board of directors. However, Crown Castle believes that, with respect to certain stock option grants, granted primarily during the period of 1998 through 2001, the proper measurement date for accounting purposes differs from the measurement date used by Crown Castle. Based upon its current estimate of potential unrecorded non-cash equity-based compensation charges associated with such stock option grants, Crown Castle does not believe such amounts would have been material to its financial statements for any of the periods to which such charges would have related. Crown Castle has not completed its review, and in the event it were to determine that any such amounts were material to any such prior periods, Crown Castle would reflect such charges in those prior periods. Crown Castle does not expect its review to result in changes to its historical revenues, Adjusted EBITDA or recurring cash flow.

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Crown Castle recognizes site rental revenues and ground lease expenses monthly on a straight-line basis, regardless of whether the receipts and payments are in equal monthly amounts. An agreement, related to an acquisition in Australia, provides the seller with a rent-free period at the beginning of the lease term, and other agreements call for rent to be prepaid for a specified period. If, and to the extent the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate lease term. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue and expense recognized in a given period represents cash collected or paid in other periods.
A summary of the non-cash portions of our site rental revenue, ground lease expense and resulting impact on site rental gross margins is as follows:
 
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, minority interests, credit (provision) for income taxes, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, interest and other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion, operating stock-based compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges (credits). Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. Sustaining capital expenditures are defined as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or term of an asset. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
