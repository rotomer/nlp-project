Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On October 5, 2006, Crown Castle International Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Crown Castle"), CCGS Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Crown Castle ("Merger Sub"), and Global Signal Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Global Signal"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Merger Agreement") whereby Global Signal will merge with and into Merger Sub ("Merger"), with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Crown Castle following the Merger. Concurrently, Crown Castle and certain stockholders of Global Signal entered into (i) support agreements, whereby such stockholders agreed to vote certain of their shares of Global Signal common stock in favor of the Merger and (ii) a stockholders agreement, whereby Crown Castle agreed to give such stockholders certain registration rights with respect to their shares of Crown Castle common stock acquired in the Merger and certain rights with respect to representation on Crown Castle's board of directors ("Board"). Immediately prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, Crown Castle amended its stockholder rights agreement to permit the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement to occur without triggering the rights of Crown Castle stockholders under such agreement.
MERGER AGREEMENT
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock of Global Signal (other than shares owned by Global Signal, Crown Castle and Merger Sub) will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof, either 1.61 shares of Crown Castle common stock or $55.95 in cash ("Cash Consideration"). The aggregate amount of Cash Consideration will be capped at $550 million and will be prorated among Global Signal's stockholders in accordance with the Merger Agreement to the extent that the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration elected exceeds this cap. In addition, at the effective time of the Merger, each option and warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase a share of Global Signal common stock will be converted into an option or warrant, as applicable, to purchase Crown Castle common stock.
The Merger is subject to a number of customary closing conditions, including, but not limited to, (i) the approval of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of Global Signal, (ii) the approval of the issuance of Crown Castle common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger ("Stock Issuance") by the stockholders of Crown Castle, (iii) the effectiveness of a Form S-4 registration statement to be filed by Crown Castle and (iv) receipt of certain regulatory approvals of the Merger.
Crown Castle and Global Signal have made customary representations and warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, (i) that each of Crown Castle and Global Signal will cause a meeting of its stockholders to be held to consider the approval of the Stock Issuance and the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement, respectively, and (ii) that the boards of directors of each of Crown Castle and Global Signal will recommend that their respective stockholders adopt and approve the Merger Agreement and approve the Stock Issuance, as applicable, in each case subject to certain exceptions.
Crown Castle also agreed to expand its Board from 10 to 13 members and to appoint a representative of each of (i) certain investment funds affiliated with Fortress Investment Group LLC (collectively, "Fortress"), (ii) Greenhill Capital Partners, L.P. and certain of its related partnerships (collectively, "Greenhill"), and (iii) Abrams Capital Partners II, L.P. and certain of its related partnerships (collectively, "Abrams", and together with Fortress and Greenhill, the "Global Signal Stockholders"), to the Board upon the consummation of the Merger, each to serve in a different class.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for Crown Castle and Global Signal, and further provides that if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Crown Castle or Global Signal will be required to pay the other a termination fee of $139,000,000.
A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement.
SUPPORT AGREEMENTS
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Crown Castle entered into a support agreement with each Global Signal Stockholder ("Support Agreements"), pursuant to which each Global Signal Stockholder agreed to vote certain of its shares of Global Signal common stock (representing in the aggregate 40% of the Global Signal common stock outstanding as of the date of the Merger Agreement) in favor of the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and against any alternative transactions. The Support Agreements will terminate upon the earlier of the consummation of the Merger and the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.
Copies of the Support Agreements are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 and are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Support Agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Support Agreements.
STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Crown Castle and the Global Signal Stockholders entered into a Stockholders Agreement ("Stockholders Agreement"), to be effective at the effective time of the Merger, which requires Crown Castle to file an automatic shelf registration statement at or immediately after the effective time of the Merger in order to register the shares of Crown Castle common stock received by the Global Signal Stockholders in the Merger (such shares, the "Registrable Securities"). After the effective time of the Merger, Crown Castle will also be obligated, upon the request of the Global Signal Stockholders, to effect an underwritten offering of Registrable Securities with an aggregate market value of at least $600 million ("Initial Sale"). After the Initial Sale and subject to certain restrictions, the Global Signal Stockholders (i) will have a limited number of demands for Crown Castle to register the Registrable Securities and (ii) will be able to have their respective Registrable Securities registered whenever Crown Castle proposes to register its equity securities. These registration rights also will apply to certain affiliates of the Global Signal Stockholders to whom they transfer Registrable Securities.
Other than (i) the Initial Sale, (ii) the disposal by Abrams of up to 2,000,000 Registrable Securities within five days after the receipt thereof and (iii) sales to certain of their respective affiliates, the Global Signal Stockholders will not be permitted to sell their respective Registrable Securities for the 90-day period following the effective time of the Merger. After that 90-day period and continuing to and including 180 days after the effective time of the Merger, in addition to sales to certain of its affiliates, each Global Signal Stockholder will be permitted to sell 50% of the Registrable Securities it owned as of the effective time of the Merger.
The Stockholders Agreement will give each Global Signal Stockholder the right to renominate one time the director that it selects for appointment to the Board at the effective time of the Merger (or another individual reasonably acceptable to Crown Castle) if such Global Signal Stockholder and certain of its affiliates own more than 3.0% of the outstanding shares of Crown Castle common stock at the time of such renomination. For so long as a Global Signal Stockholder has a designee serving on the Board pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, that director will have the right to serve on each committee of the Board (other than the strategy committee). Fortress's designee also will have the right to serve on the strategy committee.
A copy of the Stockholders Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Stockholders Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Stockholders Agreement.
RIGHTS AGREEMENT AMENDMENT
Immediately prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, Crown Castle executed an amendment ("Rights Agreement Amendment") to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of September 28, 2000, between Crown Castle International Corp. and Mellon Investor Services LLC (as successor to ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C.), as rights agent ("Rights Agreement"), so that, among other things, (i) the execution of the Merger Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement, (ii) the consummation of the Merger or of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement or the Support Agreements, (iii) the receipt of shares of Crown Castle common stock by the Global Signal Stockholders in the Merger, (iv) the transfer of shares of Crown Castle common stock by any Global Signal Stockholder to any of its affiliates or associates or from any affiliate or associate of a Global Signal Stockholder to such Global Signal Stockholder and (v) the exercise by any Global Signal Stockholder of options and warrants acquired in the Merger to acquire Crown Castle common stock, will not trigger the rights of Crown Castle stockholders to purchase shares of preferred stock of Crown Castle under the Rights Agreement.
A copy of the Rights Agreement Amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Rights Agreement Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Rights Agreement Amendment.

For the avoidance of doubt, a holder of Shares shall be permitted to make a Stock Election with respect to a portion of such holder's Shares and make a Cash Election with respect to such holder's other Shares. If such a holder does not make a Stock Election or a Cash Election with respect to all or any portion of such holder's Shares, such holder will be deemed to have made a Stock Election in the manner herein provided with respect to such Shares.
 
(ii) Crown shall prepare and mail, or cause to be prepared and mailed, with the Joint Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 5.10(a)) (x) a form of election, which form shall be subject to the reasonable review and comment of Global (the ""), (y) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 2.4(a)) and (z) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal, to the record holders of Shares as of the record date for the Global Stockholders' Meeting (as defined in Section 5.10(a)).

(iv) The determination of the Exchange Agent shall be binding as to whether or not elections to receive the Stock Consideration or the Cash Consideration have been properly made, changed or revoked pursuant to this Section 2.1(d) with respect to Shares and when elections, changes and revocations were received by it. If the Exchange Agent determines that any election to
 
receive the Cash Consideration was not properly made with respect to Shares, such shares shall be treated by the Exchange Agent as shares for which a Stock Election was made in accordance with this Section 2.1(d), and such shares shall be entitled to receive in the Merger the Stock Consideration. The Exchange Agent also shall make all computations as to proration contemplated by Section 2.1(d)(v) (which computation shall be made as soon as practicable following the Election Date), and absent manifest error any such computation shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of Shares. The Exchange Agent may make such rules as are consistent with this Section 2.1(d) for the implementation of the elections provided for herein as shall be necessary or desirable fully to effect such elections.

If in fact the undersigned were an affiliate under the Securities Act, the undersigned's ability to sell, assign or transfer the Crown Common Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for any shares of Global Common Stock pursuant to the Merger may be restricted unless such sale, assignment, or transfer is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available.

The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that appropriate legends will be placed on certificates representing Crown Common Stock received by the undersigned in the Merger or held by a transferee thereof, which legends will be removed by delivery of substitute certificates upon receipt of an opinion in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Crown from independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to Crown to the effect that such legends are no longer required for purposes of the Securities Act.
The undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully read this letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed upon the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of Crown Common Stock and (ii) the receipt by Crown of this letter is an inducement and a condition to Crown's obligations to consummate the Merger.

The combined company will have a high-quality portfolio of wireless towers that are well-positioned for expected growth, with 16,240 of its towers in the top 100 BTA's, the most of any tower company.
"We expect this extraordinary combination of companies with the most towers in the best markets to create significant value for our customers and shareholders," stated John P. Kelly, Crown Castle's Chief Executive Officer. "The complementary nature of our US portfolios will result in a high-quality, diversified customer base, with 76% of site rental revenues from the four largest US wireless carriers. Further, we have an experienced management team, which will now be leveraged across a larger portfolio, with proven abilities to excel in this industry. This transaction reflects our continued commitment to undertaking endeavors that we believe will maximize recurring cash flow per share, which we feel is the best way to create and increase shareholder value. We believe this combination enhances our ability to achieve our long-term goal of 20 to 25% annual recurring cash flow per share growth."
 
Based on pro forma results for both companies as of June 30, 2006, the combined company will have approximately $16.0 billion in total enterprise value, annualized site rental revenues of $1.2 billion and annualized Adjusted EBITDA
(1)
of $659 million. Recurring cash flow, defined as Adjusted EBITDA less interest expense less sustaining capital expenditures, based on pro forma annualized results for the second quarter 2006 for the combined company, was $329 million.
Wesley R. Edens, Global Signal's Chairman added, "This is a merger of best-in-class assets and people. We see enormous opportunity in supporting the technological investments of our tenants as the entire wireless industry continues to serve their own customers better with improved network quality, coverage and capacity. Together, our companies will have the scale, scope and growth prospects to deliver long-term value for our shareholders."
The merger is expected to generate cost synergies of between $12 million and $15 million annually, which are expected to be realized within 12 months after closing.
"We are excited about bringing together Crown Castle and Global Signal to create a powerful growth platform with a very efficient capital structure," stated Ben Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "The new company will have a cost of debt capital and flexibility that is unrivaled in the tower industry. We believe that this transaction enhances our expected growth rates of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow due to the relatively lower occupancy on the Global Signal towers and the significant lease-up potential. Further, we have a proven track record of integrating acquisitions without disrupting the delivery of services to our customers. In addition, in keeping with our capital allocation strategy, we believe this transaction is near and long-term accretive to recurring cash flow per share relative to our stand-alone expectations."
Following the closing, Crown Castle's board of directors will consist of all eight outside directors from Crown Castle's existing board of directors and three outside directors from Global Signal, as well as Mr. Kelly and Mr. Moreland. Three of Global Signal's current board members, Wesley R. Edens, Robert H. Niehaus and David C. Abrams, are expected to join Crown Castle's board upon closing. As a result, the Crown Castle board will increase from 10 to 13 members. The corporate headquarters for the combined company will remain in Houston, Texas. Mr. Kelly and Mr. Moreland will remain in their current management roles as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively.

This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, minority interests, credit (provision) for income taxes, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, interest and other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion, operating stock-based compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges (credits). Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. Sustaining capital expenditures are defined as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or term of an asset. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because Crown Castle's management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Crown Castle's measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
