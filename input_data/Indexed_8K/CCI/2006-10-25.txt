Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "We continue to grow faster than our stated long-term growth targets in each of these financial metrics. Our customers' focus on building high-quality wireless networks, coupled with our industry-leading customer satisfaction, is driving our growth. We believe the proposed acquisition of Global Signal and the resulting combined asset portfolio, in which over 16,000 of the 23,500 towers are in the top 100 US markets, will enhance Crown Castle's ability to serve all wireless carriers and increase long-term shareholder value. While we are excited about the anticipated combination with Global Signal and are working hard on integration plans, we remain focused on meeting our objectives for our existing business."

% Senior Notes, which had approximately $10.0 million and $1.7 million outstanding, respectively, at June 30, 2006, for approximately $12.7 million including accrued interest. At October 25, 2006, Crown Castle's availability under its revolving credit facility was $250 million.
"We continue to focus on activities that we believe will maximize long-term recurring cash flow per share," stated Ben Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "We believe the actions we have taken thus far during 2006, including the agreement to acquire Global Signal and the purchase of approximately 7% of common stock outstanding, will enhance the growth rate of this measure in future periods. Further, we are working on alternatives to refinance our existing credit facility at a lower interest cost, including a potential offering of additional securitized notes, which we hope to complete during the next several months. Even without the benefit of lowering our run-rate interest expense, our expected growth in recurring cash flow per share for full year 2006 based on our outlook is approximately 40%, which significantly exceeds our 20% to 25% annual target."

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Crown Castle recognizes site rental revenues and ground lease expenses monthly on a straight-line basis, regardless of whether the receipts and payments are in equal monthly amounts. An agreement, related to an acquisition in Australia, provides the seller with a rent-free period at the beginning of the lease term, and other agreements call for rent to be prepaid for a specified period. If, and to the extent the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate lease term. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue and expense recognized in a given period represents cash collected or paid in other periods.
A summary of the non-cash portions of our site rental revenue, ground lease expense, stock-based compensation for those employees directly related to U.S. tower operations, and resulting impact on site rental gross margins is as follows:
 
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, minority interests, benefit (provision) for income taxes, interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, losses on purchases and redemptions of debt, interest and other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion, operating stock-based compensation charges, asset write-down charges and restructuring charges (credits). Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. Sustaining capital expenditures are defined as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or term of an asset. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
