"We had an excellent quarter as we exceeded our outlook for tower site rental revenue, tower gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow," stated John P. Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "Along with delivering these results, we made significant progress on the integration of Global Signal. Further, we are slightly ahead of our estimates of cost savings related to the Global Signal merger. I am pleased with the progress we have made on our integration efforts while at the same time delivering results that exceed our Outlook for operating metrics."

INVESTMENTS AND LIQUIDITY
During the second quarter of 2007, Crown Castle invested approximately $77.7 million in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures was comprised of $6.7 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $71.0 million of revenue generating capital expenditures, of which $37.2 million was spent on land purchases, $5.9 million on existing sites, $16.9 million on the construction of new sites and $10.9 million for the purchase of its corporate headquarters.
"Based on our second quarter 2007 results and outlook for full year 2007, we expect to start building additional debt capacity during the second half of 2007 within our stated leverage target of six to eight times debt to Adjusted EBITDA," stated Ben Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "Since we purchased 17.7 million shares in January 2007 with $600 million of borrowed funds, we have reduced our total debt leverage, somewhat ahead of schedule, from 9.0 times, based on annualized first quarter 2007 Adjusted EBITDA, to 8.0 times leverage, based on annualized second quarter 2007 Adjusted EBITDA. Consistent with our past actions, we can resume borrowing within our stated leverage target to augment our investment of recurring cash flow in activites that we believe will maximize long-term recurring cash flow per share. We continue to believe that we can achieve 20% to 25% annual growth in recurring cash flow per share through revenue and margin growth on our towers combined with the appropriate investment of cash in share purchases, land purchases, tower builds and other tower related capital expenditures. While some of these investments, particularly share purchases, are dilutive in the short-term to recurring cash flow per share when done with borrowed funds, we believe that the combination of continuing operating performance, maintaining an appropriately levered balance sheet and investing in activities related to our core business will enable us to enhance long-term recurring cash flow per share."
LONG-TERM SPECTRUM LEASE
As previously announced on July 23, 2007, a Crown Castle subsidiary entered into a lease of its U.S. nationwide 1670-1675 MHz spectrum ("Spectrum"). The Spectrum is leased to a venture formed by Telcom Ventures, LLC and Columbia Capital, LLC ("Lessee") for a $13 million annual lease fee beginning July 23, 2007 until October 1, 2013. Upon the expiration of the initial term of the lease, the Lessee will have the right to acquire the Spectrum for $130 million, escalated at CPI from

July 2007, or to renew the lease for a period of up to ten years on the same terms, subject to the annual lease fee increasing to $14.3 million. As part of such transaction, Crown Castle has transferred to Lessee the subsidiary holding the assets related to its trial network in New York City and will be the preferred provider of tower infrastructure during the Spectrum lease for future tower sites as the Spectrum is deployed by Lessee. Further, Crown Castle expects that substantially all of its operating and general and administrative costs associated with its Emerging Businesses segment will be eliminated as a result of the transactions described above.
OUTLOOK

The Outlook tables include the expected impact of the Merger on Crown Castle's results from January 12, 2007 to December 31, 2007 and assume a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.75 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollars.
As reflected in the following tables, Crown Castle has increased the midpoint of its full year 2007 Outlook, previously issued on May 2, 2007, for site rental revenue by $6 million, site rental gross margin by $6.5 million, Adjusted EBITDA by $12.5 million and recurring cash flow by $13 million.
This Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein is set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Crown Castle recognizes site rental revenues and ground lease expenses monthly on a straight-line basis, regardless of whether the receipts and payments are in equal monthly amounts. An agreement, related to an acquisition in Australia, provides the seller with a rent-free period at the beginning of the lease term, and other agreements call for rent to be prepaid for a specified period. If and to the extent the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate lease term. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue and expense recognized in a given period represents cash collected or paid in other periods.
A summary of the non-cash portions of our site rental revenue, ground lease expense, stock-based compensation for those employees directly related to U.S. tower operations, net amortization of below-market and above-market leases, and resulting impact on site rental gross margins is as follows:
 
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, losses on purchases and redemptions of debt, interest and other income (expense), interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, benefit (provision) for income taxes, minority interests, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and stock-based compensation charges. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. Sustaining capital expenditures are defined as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or term of an asset. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Recurring cash flow per share is not intended to be an alternative measure of earnings per share.
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a

measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the tower industry and in the historical financial statements of Global Signal. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
