FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 30, 2007  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2007. On January 12, 2007, Global Signal Inc. ("Global Signal") merged into a subsidiary of Crown Castle ("Merger"). These reported results include the effect of the Merger for the third quarter of 2007 and are compared to (i) pre-Merger historical results of Crown Castle for prior fiscal periods and (ii) selected pro forma results for the third quarter of 2006, assuming the Merger was completed on January 1, 2006.
"We had another solid quarter, exceeding the midpoint of our third quarter Outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow," stated John P. Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "Our new leasing pipeline continues to build. Further, with the AWS spectrum clearing process well underway, our confidence in the growth of new leasing revenue continues to increase. In addition, we made significant progress in the third quarter with the integration of the Global Signal assets and anticipate that we will be substantially complete by the end of the year. Along with the third quarter results, we are announcing our full year 2008 Outlook which suggests approximately 25% year-over-year growth in recurring cash flow per share, which is at the high end of our previously stated annual growth goal of 20% to 25%. Our expectation for growth in recurring cash flow per share reinforces our belief that our well-located assets, industry-leading customer service, and efficient capital structure will create short and long-term value for our shareholders."
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS
 
 
Site rental revenue for the third quarter of 2007 increased $147.8 million, or 82.6%, to $326.8 million from $179.0 million for the same period in the prior year. Pro forma site rental revenue growth was 7.3%, comparing reported third quarter 2007 results to pro forma third quarter 2006 results, exclusive of approximately $1.1 million and $6.5 million of out of run-rate items in the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2006, respectively. Site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenue less site rental cost of operations, increased $91.2 million, or 73.7%, to $214.9 million in the third quarter of 2007 from the same period in 2006. Pro forma site rental gross margin growth was 10.0%, comparing reported third quarter 2007 results to pro forma third quarter 2006 results, exclusive of the previously mentioned out of run-rate site rental revenue.

Weighted average common shares outstanding increased to 282.6 million for the third quarter of 2007, inclusive of the impact from the Merger, from 201.1 million for the same period in the prior year. Recurring cash flow per share, defined as recurring cash flow divided by weighted average common shares outstanding, was $0.36 in the third quarter of 2007, inclusive of $(0.02) per share of dilution from the previously mentioned borrowings used to reduce potential and actual shares outstanding, compared to $0.31 in the third quarter of 2006.

INVESTMENTS AND LIQUIDITY
During the third quarter of 2007, Crown Castle invested approximately $66.3 million in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures was comprised of $5.6 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $60.7 million of revenue generating capital expenditures, of which $34.7 million was spent on land purchases, $10.9 million on existing sites and $15.1 million on the construction of new sites.
OUTLOOK
"As presented below, we are providing full year 2008 Outlook for operating results that suggests growth in recurring cash flow per share of approximately 25% year-over-year, which is at the high end of our stated goal of 20% to 25% annual growth," stated Ben Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "This anticipated growth reflects the expected performance of our tower business, the efficiency of our capital structure in translating revenue growth into recurring cash flow per share growth, and the impact of prior investment decisions, including the acquisition of Global Signal and the purchase of 30% of our fully diluted shares over the last four years. While there are many potential factors that could drive additional leasing in 2008 beyond our expectations, our full year 2008 Outlook suggests site rental revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately $100 million, in-line with the growth we are experiencing in 2007. I am very pleased that this level of growth in site rental revenue and Adjusted EBITDA translates into achieving the high end of our targeted growth rate in recurring cash flow per share."
The following Outlook tables are based on current expectations and assumptions. The Outlook tables include the expected impact of the Merger on Crown Castle's results from January 12,
 
 
2007 and assume a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.85 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollar for fourth quarter 2007 Outlook. Crown Castle has assumed an exchange rate of 0.83 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollar for full year 2007 and full year 2008 Outlook.

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Crown Castle recognizes site rental revenues and ground lease expenses monthly on a straight-line basis, regardless of whether the receipts and payments are in equal monthly amounts. An agreement, related to an acquisition in Australia, provides the seller with a rent-free period at the beginning of the lease term, and other agreements call for rent to be prepaid for a specified period. If and to the extent the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate lease term. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue and expense recognized in a given period represents cash collected or paid in other periods.
A summary of the non-cash portions of our site rental revenue, ground lease expense, stock-based compensation for those employees directly related to U.S. tower operations, net amortization of below-market and above-market leases acquired, and resulting impact on site rental gross margins is as follows:
 
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, losses on purchases and redemptions of debt, interest and other income (expense), interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, benefit (provision) for income taxes, minority interests, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and stock-based compensation charges. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. Sustaining capital expenditures are defined as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or term of an asset. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Recurring cash flow per share is not intended to be an alternative measure of earnings per share.
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the
 
 
tower industry and in the historical financial statements of Global Signal. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
