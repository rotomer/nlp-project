On December 17, 2007, Crown Castle International Corp. ("Company") entered into interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $625 million, to hedge its exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates related to future interest payments pursuant to the term loan under the Credit Agreement, dated January 9, 2007, among Crown Castle Operating Company, as borrower, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, the several lenders from time to time parties thereto, and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, as administrative agent. Under the swap agreements, the Company has agreed to pay a weighted average fixed interest rate of approximately 4.134%, from December 31, 2007 through December 31, 2009, in exchange for receiving interest payments at a variable rate based on three-month LIBOR on the same $625 million notional amount for the same two-year period.
