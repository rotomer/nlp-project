Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 6, 2008  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007. On January 12, 2007, Global Signal Inc. merged into a subsidiary of Crown Castle ("Merger"). The results of the former subsidiaries of Global Signal Inc. ("Global Signal") are included in the results from January 12, 2007. These 2007 results are compared to (i) pre-Merger historical results of Crown Castle for prior fiscal periods and (ii) selected pro forma results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, assuming the Merger was completed on January 1, 2006.
"We had an excellent fourth quarter and full year 2007, exceeding our previously provided outlook for site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow," stated John P. Kelly, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "As I look back on 2007, I am very pleased with our full year results driven by greater than expected cost synergies following our acquisition of Global Signal and strong site rental revenue growth across our entire portfolio of towers. In addition to strong operating results, we have substantially completed all of our integration activities and are on track to finish the few remaining items in the first quarter. I commend our employees for the tremendous job they did in 2007, exceeding our operating targets and successfully integrating Global Signal. I believe that our fully integrated portfolio of towers is well-located to serve our customers, and coupled with the actions we have continued to take to optimize our capital structure, positions us for strong recurring cash flow per share growth in 2008."

"During the last four months, we have continued our long-standing practice of investing significantly in our tower business," stated Ben Moreland, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "The strong growth that we experienced in Adjusted EBITDA during the second half of 2007 moved us within our targeted debt to Adjusted EBITDA leverage range of six to eight times, enabling us to opportunistically borrow funds to make investments that we believe will maximize long-term recurring cash flow per share. Consistent with our past actions, we have continued to evaluate and invest in share repurchases, construction of new sites, tower acquisitions and land purchases, which we believe will be long-term accretive to our business. The investment in our own towers via share repurchases continues to be motivated by our expectation that we can grow recurring cash flow per share 20% to 25% per year."

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Crown Castle recognizes site rental revenues and ground lease expenses monthly on a straight-line basis, regardless of whether the receipts and payments are in equal monthly amounts. An agreement, related to an acquisition in Australia, provides the seller with a rent-free period at the beginning of the lease term, and other agreements call for rent to be prepaid for a specified period. If, and to the extent the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate lease term. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue and expense recognized in a given period represents cash collected or paid in other periods.
 
A summary of the non-cash portions of our site rental revenue, ground lease expense, stock-based compensation for those employees directly related to US tower operations, net amortization of below-market and above-market lease acquired, and resulting impact on site rental gross margins is as follows:
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, losses on purchases and redemptions of debt, interest and other income (expense), interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, impairment of available-for-sale securities, benefit (provision) for income taxes, minority interests, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and stock-based compensation charges. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. Sustaining capital expenditures are defined as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or life of an asset. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the tower industry and in the historical financial statements of Global Signal. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
