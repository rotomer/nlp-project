FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 23, 2008  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 and announced that the Board of Directors has approved a succession plan for its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Effective July 1, 2008, Ben Moreland, currently Crown Castle's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will become Crown Castle's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Brown, currently Crown Castle's Vice President and Treasurer, will become Crown Castle's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. John Kelly, currently Crown Castle's President and Chief Executive Officer, will remain in an executive position as Executive Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"We had a very good first quarter 2008, exceeding our estimates for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow," stated Mr. Kelly. "The year over year growth in recurring cash flow per share of 40% that we achieved in the first quarter of 2008, as compared to the first quarter of 2007, demonstrates the significant growth that we are able to deliver with our tower portfolio and capital structure. During the first quarter of 2008, we completed the few remaining integration items related to our acquisition of Global Signal last year. We are encouraged by our year to date results, as reflected in our increase to full year 2008 Outlook. Further, with the successful conclusion of the 700 MHz auction and the accelerating growth in wireless data services, I remain excited about the long-term opportunities for our business."

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Crown Castle recognizes site rental revenues and ground lease expenses monthly on a straight-line basis, regardless of whether the receipts and payments are in equal monthly amounts. An agreement, related to an acquisition in Australia, provides the seller with a rent-free period at the beginning of the lease term, and other agreements call for rent to be prepaid for a specified period. If, and to the extent the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate lease term. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue and expense recognized in a given period represents cash collected or paid in other periods.
 
 
A summary of the non-cash portions of our site rental revenue, ground lease expense, stock-based compensation for those employees directly related to US tower operations, net amortization of below-market and above-market lease acquired, and resulting impact on site rental gross margins is as follows:
 
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, losses on purchases and redemptions of debt, interest and other income (expense), interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, impairment of available-for-sale securities, benefit (provision) for income taxes, minority interests, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and stock-based compensation charges. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. We define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or life of our revenue generating assets and include capitalized costs related to (i) maintenance activities on our towers, (ii) vehicles, (iii) information technology equipment, and (iv) office equipment. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the tower industry and in the historical financial statements of Global Signal. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
