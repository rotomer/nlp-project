Item 5.02.    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
(c)        On May 23, 2008, the Board of Directors ("Board") of Crown Castle International Corp. ("Company") approved a base salary of $450,000 for John P. Kelly, effective as of July 1, 2008, in connection with his appointment as Executive Vice Chairman of the Board (as previously reported in the Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on April 25, 2008 ("April 25 Form 8-K")). Other than this base salary adjustment, Mr. Kelly's compensation arrangements remain substantially unchanged.
On May 23, 2008, the Board also approved the grant of a restricted stock award ("RSA") with respect to 6,555 shares to Ben Moreland. The RSA was granted in order to correct an error in determining the number of shares subject to the RSAs previously granted to Mr. Moreland in connection with his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective July 1, 2008 (as previously reported in the April 25 Form 8-K).
The t erms of the RSA are the same as those reported in the April 25 Form 8-K, namely that the RSA vests on February 21, 2011 or thereafter if the Company's common stock closes at or above $41.50 per share for any 20 consecutive trading days which include any date on or before February 21, 2011. Any shares subject to the RSA that have not otherwise vested pursuant to the preceding sentence will generally be forfeited.
The RSA was granted pursuant to the Company's 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended. A form of the standard Restricted Stock Agreement generally used for the Company's 2004 Stock Incentive Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to the Company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 2, 2005.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
