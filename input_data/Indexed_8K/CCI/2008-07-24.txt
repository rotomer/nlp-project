FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

"We had another excellent quarter, growing recurring cash flow per share by 34% over last year, significantly exceeding our internal target," stated Ben Moreland, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "This result of achieving approximately four times the rate of site rental revenue growth in recurring cash flow per share illustrates the efficiency of Crown Castle's capital structure. In addition, in the first half of 2008, we experienced an 11% increase in leasing activity and associated revenue in the US compared to same period last year. We remain excited by the long-term growth prospects for site rental revenue from the continued deployment of wireless voice and data services and the migration from wireline to wireless telecommunications."

INVESTMENTS AND LIQUIDITY
During the second quarter of 2008, Crown Castle invested approximately $140.7 million in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures was comprised of $5 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $135.7 million of revenue generating capital expenditures, of which $73.5 million was spent on land purchases, $18.4 million on existing sites and $43.8 million on the construction and acquisition of new sites. As of June 30, 2008, Crown Castle has $100 million of undrawn capacity under its revolving credit facility.
"I am very pleased that in the second quarter we converted 100% of the year-over-year growth in site rental revenues into Adjusted EBITDA, reflecting the diligence with which we have managed our costs following the Global Signal acquisition," stated Jay Brown, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "Our long-standing strategy of investing cash, both from operations and borrowings, to maximize long-term cash flow per share coupled with the strong operating performance of our towers has delivered results above our targeted annual growth rate of 20% to 25% in recurring cash flow per share. Consistent with our past actions, during the second quarter of 2008, we invested approximately $141 million in our core tower business, including land purchases, construction of new sites and tower acquisitions. As presented in the Outlook table below, we have increased our 2008 Outlook largely based on the operating results from the first half of the year."
OUTLOOK
The following Outlook tables are based on current expectations and assumptions. The Outlook tables assume a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.94 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollar for the second half of 2008.
As reflected in the following tables, Crown Castle has increased the approximate midpoint of its full year 2008 Outlook, previously issued on April 23, 2008, for site rental revenue by $5 million, site rental gross margin by $5 million and Adjusted EBITDA by $5 million.
This Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially.

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Crown Castle recognizes site rental revenues and ground lease expenses monthly on a straight-line basis, regardless of whether the receipts and payments are in equal monthly amounts. If, and to the extent the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate lease term. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue and expense recognized in a given period represents cash collected or paid in other periods.
A summary of the non-cash portions of our site rental revenue, ground lease expense, stock-based compensation for those employees directly related to US tower operations, net amortization of below-market and above-market leases acquired, and resulting impact on site rental gross margins is as follows:
 
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, losses on purchases and redemptions of debt, interest and other income (expense), interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, impairment of available-for-sale securities, benefit (provision) for income taxes, minority interests, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. We define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or life of our revenue generating assets and include capitalized costs related to (i) maintenance activities on our towers, (ii) vehicles, (iii) information technology equipment, and (iv) office equipment. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the tower industry and in the historical financial statements of Global Signal. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
