FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 5, 2008  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.
"We had another strong quarter of record results, exceeding the midpoint of our third quarter Outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and recurring cash flow," stated Ben Moreland, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "We are experiencing solid growth in our business and remain excited about the strong fundamentals underlying our business, driven by the increasing demand for wireless communication services even in light of the global economic slowdown. Along with the third quarter results, we are announcing our full year 2009 Outlook which suggests annual site rental revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% and 10%, respectively, on a currency neutral basis."
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS
Total revenue for the third quarter of 2008 increased 9% to $384.3 million from $351.7 million in the same period in 2007. Site rental revenue for the third quarter of 2008 increased $27.2 million, or 8%, to $354.0 million from $326.8 million for the same period in the prior year. Site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenue less site rental cost of operations, increased $23.3 million, or 11%, to $238.2 million in the third quarter of 2008 from $214.9 million in the same period in 2007. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2008 increased $21.9 millionor 11%, to $217.7 million from $195.8 million in the same period in 2007. Crown Castle's previously issued Outlook for third quarter 2008 was based on a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.94 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollar compared to an actual exchange rate of 0.89 US dollars to 1.00
,
 
Australian dollar, which negatively impacted site rental revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by $1.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively.
Recurring cash flow, defined as Adjusted EBITDA less interest expense and sustaining capital expenditures, increased 23% from $100.8 million in the third quarter of 2007 to $123.5 million for the third quarter of 2008. Weighted average common shares outstanding was 283.6 million for the third quarter of 2008, as compared to 282.6 million for the same period in the prior year.

Net loss was $32.2 million for the third quarter of 2008, inclusive of a $23.7 million impairment charge to write-down Crown Castle's investment in FiberTower Corporation, compared to a net loss of $67.0 million for the same period in 2007, inclusive of a $37.5 million asset write-down charge, net of tax, related to the long-term spectrum lease previously held by Modeo.

SEGMENT RESULTS
US site rental revenue for the third quarter of 2008 increased $22.9 million, or 7%, to $332.7 million, compared to third quarter 2007 US site rental revenue of $309.8 million. US site rental gross margin increased $19.2 million, or 9%, to $223.0 million from the same period in 2007.

INVESTMENTS
During the third quarter of 2008, Crown Castle invested approximately $140.3 million in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures was comprised of $6.1 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $134.2 million of revenue generating capital expenditures, of which $63.8 million was spent on land purchases, $21.7 million on existing sites and $48.7 million on the construction and acquisition of new sites.
"In light of the significant deterioration of the credit markets, we intend to reduce our discretionary capital expenditures and allocate the majority of our cash flow to eliminate our upcoming debt maturities," stated Jay Brown, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "As noted in our Outlook section of this release, we expect to generate approximately $670 million of recurring cash flow during the fourth quarter of 2008 and full year 2009. Over the next 14 months, we have approximately $472 million of debt maturities, which we expect to repay, unless we are able to refinance all or a portion of this debt. Given the predictable level of cash flow that our business produces and that we have no other significant debt maturities until February 2011, I am comfortable that we will be able to navigate the difficult credit markets without impacting the core growth or execution of our business as we drive toward long-term value creation for our shareholders."
In the third quarter, Crown Castle recorded an impairment charge of $23.7 million related to the decline in the market value of its FiberTower investment. The timing and nature of the charge was based primarily on the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than the adjusted cost basis, and the impact of current broad-based economic and market conditions on the short-term prospects for recovery of the FiberTower stock price. As of September 30, 2008, Crown Castle's FiberTower investment had a carrying value of $36.4 million.
OUTLOOK
This Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein is set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
In the third quarter 2008, approximately 6% of Crown Castle's site rental revenue was derived from its tower operations in Australia. The 2008 Outlook issued on July 24, 2008 assumed a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.94 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollar for the second half of 2008. Since its previously issued Outlook, the Australian dollar to US dollar
 
 
exchange rate has decreased by approximately 30%. Based on the current exchange rate, the exchange rate assumptions for the fourth quarter 2008 have been adjusted to 0.64 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollar. The estimated impact to site rental revenue and site rental gross margin in the 2008 Outlook from the decrease in the forecasted Australian dollar exchange rate is expected to be approximately $7 million and $5 million, respectively, which Crown Castle has reflected in its revised full year 2008 Outlook.
Similar to the rate of growth forecasted for 2008, Crown Castle expects 2009 site rental revenue growth, on a currency neutral basis, of approximately 8%. The Outlook table below reflects site rental revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately $93 million and $76 million, respectively, from 2008 to 2009, which includes approximately $16 million and $10 million, respectively, of negative impact from the movement in the Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate. Further, the 2009 Outlook assumes no further borrowings, reduction in interest expense associated with debt repayment, or changes in interest rates.
The Outlook table is based on current expectations and assumptions. The Outlook table assumes a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.64 and 0.67 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollar for the fourth quarter of 2008 and full year 2009 Outlook, respectively.
The following table sets forth Crown Castle's current Outlook for the fourth quarter of 2008, full year 2008 and full year 2009:

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Crown Castle recognizes site rental revenues and ground lease expenses monthly on a straight-line basis, regardless of whether the receipts and payments are in equal monthly amounts. If, and to the extent the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate lease term. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue and expense recognized in a given period represents cash collected or paid in other periods.
A summary of the non-cash portions of our site rental revenue, ground lease expense, stock-based compensation for those employees directly related to US tower operations, net amortization of below-market and above-market leases acquired, and resulting impact on site rental gross margins is as follows:
 
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, losses on purchases and redemptions of debt, interest and other income (expense), interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, impairment of available-for-sale securities, benefit (provision) for income taxes, minority interests, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. We define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or life of our revenue generating assets and include capitalized costs related to (i) maintenance activities on our towers, (ii) vehicles, (iii) information technology equipment, and (iv) office equipment. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the tower industry and in the historical financial statements of Global Signal. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
