Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 24, 2009  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2008.
"We had an excellent fourth quarter and full year 2008, exceeding our previously provided outlook for site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow," stated Ben Moreland, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "Despite current economic conditions, leasing demand for our towers remains strong and consistent with levels experienced in 2007 and 2008, fueled by the continued demand for voice and 3G data services and the continued migration from landlines to wireless. As reflected in recent announcements by some of our largest customers, wireless communications, and particularly the wireless data market, continue to resist underlying economic trends, as evidenced by year-over-year growth in data revenues. Data revenues continue to be of increasing importance to the carriers and our results indicate that we are well-positioned to take advantage of this trend in wireless communications."
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS
Site rental revenues for fourth quarter 2008 increased $17.5 million, or 5%, to $355.0 million from $337.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Adjusting for the impact of the 24% decrease in the Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate from fourth quarter 2007 to fourth quarter 2008, site rental revenue grew 7%. Site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenues less site rental cost of operations, increased 7% to $240.8 million, up $16.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 from $224.8 million in the same period in 2007. Adjusted EBITDA for fourth quarter 2008 increased $16.2 millionor 8%, to $225.4 million, up from $209.2 million for the same period in 2007. On a currency-adjusted basis, both site rental gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA grew 9% in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the same quarter in 2007.

Recurring cash flow, defined as Adjusted EBITDA less interest expense less sustaining capital expenditures, increased from $110.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 to $125.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, up 13%, or 15% on a currency-adjusted basis. Recurring cash flow per share, defined as recurring cash flow divided by weighted average common shares outstanding, was $0.44 in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $0.39 in the fourth quarter of 2007, an 11% increase, or 14% on a currency-adjusted basis.
Net loss was $63.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to a net loss of $80.2 million for the same period in 2007. Net loss after deduction of dividends on preferred stock was $69.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to a loss of $85.4 million for the same period in 2007. Fourth quarter 2008 net loss per share was $0.24, compared to a net loss per share of $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Site rental revenues for full year 2008 increased 9% to $1.403 billion, up $116.1 million from $1.286 billion for full year 2007. The comparisons between full year 2008 and full year 2007 results were not materially impacted by the Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate. Site rental gross margin for full year 2008 increased 12% to $946.4 million, up $103.3 million from $843.1 million for full year 2007. Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2008 increased $108.5 million, or 14%, to $867.1 million, up from $758.6 million for full year 2007.
Recurring cash flow increased $100.9 million, or 26%, from $385.1 million for full year 2007 to $485.9 million for full year 2008. Recurring cash flow per share was $1.72 in full year 2008 compared to $1.38 for full year 2007.
Net loss was $48.9 million for full year 2008 compared to a net loss of $222.8 million for full year 2007. Net loss after deduction of dividends on preferred stock was $69.7 million for full year 2008, compared to a net loss of $243.6 million for full year 2007. Full year 2008 net loss per share was $0.25 compared to a net loss per share of $0.87 for full year 2007.
 
SEGMENT RESULTS

Crown Castle's fourth quarter Australia operations were negatively impacted by the approximately 24% decline in the Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2008. Revenues from Australia represented approximately 6% of total consolidated revenues in 2008. On a currency-adjusted basis and before a non-recurring payment of $1.8 million that was received in the fourth quarter of 2007, Australia site rental revenues and site rental gross margin for fourth quarter 2008 grew 10% over fourth quarter 2007.
INVESTMENTS AND LIQUIDITY
During the first quarter of 2009, Crown Castle issued $900.0 million of senior notes due in 2015 and extended its revolving credit facility for 364 days. The net proceeds from the notes offering will be used for general corporate purposes including the repayment or repurchase of certain outstanding indebtedness of Crown Castle's subsidiaries. Also, during the first quarter of 2009, Crown Castle purchased $134.8 million of its Global Signal securitized notes for $125.5 million, which represents a 7% discount to the face amount of such notes. These purchases were comprised of $47.1 million face value of Global Signal securitized notes due in December 2009 (purchased for $46.5 million, including accrued interest), and $87.8 million face value of Global Signal securitized loans due in February 2011 (purchased for $79.0 million, including accrued interest). As of February 24, 2009, Crown Castle had approximately $860.0 million in cash and investments (excluding restricted cash) and $30.0 million of undrawn capacity under its revolving credit facility.
"We are very pleased to have successfully accessed the credit markets to both extend our revolving credit facility and issue the senior notes, particularly in this difficult credit environment," stated Jay Brown, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "The proceeds of the notes offering, together with the significant cash flow generated by our business and the substantial reduction in our discretionary capital expenditures, allow us to both repay the $411.0 million of debt maturities due in the next twelve months and considerably reduce our future refinancing requirements. As anticipated, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we reduced capital expenditures on land and new tower construction by $50.0 million, or 44%, compared to third quarter 2008, completing the majority of our in-process projects. Further, based on our current expectations, we believe 2009 expenditures on land and new tower construction will be approximately 90% lower than 2008 levels."
 
During the fourth quarter of 2008, Crown Castle invested $108.0 million in capital expenditures comprised of $12.2 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $95.8 million of revenue generating capital expenditures, of which $36.8 million was spent on land purchases, $33.2 million on existing sites, and $25.8 million on the construction and acquisition of new sites.
In the fourth quarter of 2008, Crown Castle recorded an impairment charge of $32.2 million related to the decline in the market value of its FiberTower investment. As of December 31, 2008, Crown Castle's FiberTower investment had a carrying value of $4.2 million.

OUTLOOK
The following Outlook tables are based on current expectations and assumptions. The Outlook tables include the increased interest expense associated with the $900 million of 9% senior notes issued in January 2009, and assume a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.65 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollar for first quarter and full year 2009 Outlook. For the purposes of this Outlook, interest expense is based on run-rate interest charges, and does not assume early debt retirement prior to the maturity date, with the exception of the purchases to-date.

Summary of Non-Cash Amounts in Tower Gross Margin
In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Crown Castle recognizes site rental revenues and ground lease expenses monthly on a straight-line basis, regardless of whether the receipts and payments are in equal monthly amounts. If, and to the extent the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases or rent free periods), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the appropriate lease term. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue and expense recognized in a given period represents cash collected or paid in other periods.
A summary of the non-cash portions of our site rental revenues, ground lease expense, stock-based compensation for those employees directly related to tower operations, net amortization of below-market and above-market leases, and resulting impact on site rental gross margins is as follows:
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, losses on purchases and redemptions of debt, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest and other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, minority interests, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. We define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or life of our revenue generating assets and include capitalized costs related to (i) maintenance activities on our towers, (ii) vehicles, (iii) information technology equipment, and (iv) office equipment. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
