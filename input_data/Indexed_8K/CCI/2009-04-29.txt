Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 29, 2009  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.
"We had a very good first quarter, exceeding the midpoint of our Outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and recurring cash flow," stated Ben Moreland, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "I am very pleased that our year-over-year results were achieved almost entirely through organic growth on assets that we owned as of January 1, 2008. We enjoyed strong growth in leasing applications during the first four months of 2009, which we expect will translate into additional new tenants during the second half of 2009. We believe that this increased activity reflects our customers' desire to build and enhance their networks in light of the continued strong demand from consumers for wireless voice and increasing demand for wireless data services. The combination of strong first quarter results, increased leasing application volume, and tight management of operating and G&A expenses, allows us to raise our full year 2009 Outlook, which now suggests annual site rental revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% and 12%, respectively."
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS
Site rental revenues for first quarter 2009 increased $22.6 million, or 7%, to $367.7 million from $345.0 million for the same period in the prior year. Site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenues less site rental cost of operations, increased 11% to $258.0 million, up $25.3 million in the first quarter of 2009 from $232.7 million in the same period in 2008. Adjusted EBITDA for first quarter 2009 increased $31.4 millionor 15%, to $242.4 million, up from $211.0 million for the same period in 2008.
,
Recurring cash flow, defined as Adjusted EBITDA less interest expense less sustaining capital expenditures, increased from $118.1 million in the first quarter of 2008 to $131.8 million for the first quarter of 2009, up 12%. Recurring cash flow per share, defined as recurring cash flow divided by weighted average common shares outstanding, was $0.46 in the first quarter of 2009 compared to $0.42 in the first quarter of 2008, an increase of 9%.
 
For the first quarter 2009, approximately 5% of Crown Castle's consolidated revenues were from its Australia subsidiary.

INVESTMENTS AND LIQUIDITY
Since January 1, 2009, Crown Castle has raised $2.3 billion of debt to refinance upcoming debt maturities. Additionally, since January 1, 2009, Crown Castle has purchased $319.5 million of secured notes, issued by certain of its subsidiaries, for $305.3 million, which represents a 4% discount to the face amount of such notes.
During the first quarter of 2009, Crown Castle issued $900 million of 9% senior notes due in 2015 and extended its revolving credit facility for 364 days. In April 2009, Crown Castle issued $1.2 billion of 7.75% senior secured notes due in 2017. The combined proceeds of these issuances will predominantly be used to repay upcoming debt maturities, including the securitized notes due December 2009 and February 2011. Crown Castle expects to repay, in full, the securitized notes due February 2011 on April 30, 2009.
Since the beginning of 2009, Crown Castle has purchased $319.5 million of securitized notes issued by certain of its subsidiaries. These purchases were comprised of $72.0 million face value of the securitized notes due in December 2009 (purchased for $71.3 million) and $247.5 million face value of the securitized notes due in February 2011 (purchased for $234.0 million). Pro forma as of the date of completion of the 7.75% senior notes offering and the repayment of the securitized notes due February 2011, Crown Castle expects to have approximately $274 million in cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) and $188 million of availability under its $188 million revolving credit facility.
During the first quarter of 2009, Crown Castle invested $39.3 million in capital expenditures comprised of $5.0 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $34.3 million of revenue generating capital expenditures, of which $3.4 million was spent on land purchases, $24.7 million on existing sites, and $6.2 million on the construction and acquisition of new sites. Total capital expenditures were down approximately 64% from the fourth quarter 2008.
"We are very pleased to have successfully accessed the credit markets multiple times this year for $2.3 billion of capital, thereby extending the maturity schedule of our debt," stated Jay Brown, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "I believe that our ability to have accessed the credit markets in a significant way reflects our long-term contracted revenues and the essential nature of our assets for wireless networks. As we anticipated, we have proactively dealt with all of our near-term debt maturities through 2011 with our notes offerings this year. Further, as a result of our debt repayments, we accomplished our most recent notes offering without increasing our run-rate interest expense. Importantly, these recent financings eliminate our requirement to access the credit markets for almost five years as we are able to repay all of our debt maturities between now and then with cash on-hand and cash flow."
 
In addition to the tables and information contained in this press release, Crown Castle will post supplemental information on its website at that will be discussed during its conference call tomorrow morning, Thursday April 30, 2009.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on purchases and redemptions of debt, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest and other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. We define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or life of our revenue generating assets and include capitalized costs related to (i) maintenance activities on our towers, (ii) vehicles, (iii) information technology equipment, and (iv) office equipment. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
