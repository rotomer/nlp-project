Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 20, 2009  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE: CCI) announced today that certain of its indirect subsidiaries have priced $250 million of Senior Secured Notes, Series 2009-1 ("Notes"). Such subsidiaries hold a portion of the U.S. towers acquired by Crown Castle in its acquisition of Global Signal, Inc. The Notes will be secured on a first priority basis by a pledge of the equity interests of the subsidiaries holding such towers and by certain other assets of such subsidiaries. Crown Castle expects the offering to close on July 31, 2009.
The offering consists of two classes of Notes, Class A-1 and Class A-2, both of which are expected to be rated investment grade and issued at par. The Class A-1 Notes consist of $175 million of 6.25% Notes and fully amortize during the period beginning in January 2010 and ending on the final maturity date in August 2019. The Class A-2 Notes consist of $75 million of 9.0% Notes and fully amortize during the period beginning in September 2019 and ending on the final maturity date in August 2029. The weighted average interest rate on the Notes is approximately 7.1%.
The net proceeds of the offering will be used by the subsidiaries, together with other cash, to repay in full the outstanding mortgage loans of such subsidiaries relating to the Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-2 (the "Certificates"), issued in 2004 by Global Signal Trust II. The proceeds of such repayment will be deposited with the trustee for the Certificates and will be distributed to the holders of such Certificates in accordance with the terms of the Trust.
 
The Notes will be obligations of the subsidiaries that are currently obligors under the mortgage loans being repaid. The Notes will not be guaranteed by and will not be obligations of Crown Castle International Corp. or any of its other subsidiaries.
This press release is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the Notes in any jurisdiction in which any such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. The Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or any state securities laws, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
Crown Castle owns, operates and leases towers and other communication structures for wireless communications. Crown Castle offers significant wireless communications coverage to 91 of the top 100 U.S. markets and to substantially all of the Australian population.
