Exhibit 99.1
July 29, 2009  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.
"We had an excellent second quarter, exceeding the top end of our Outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and recurring cash flow," stated Ben Moreland, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "Despite prevailing macroeconomic conditions, we continue to enjoy strong leasing demand for our towers, as evidenced by year-over-year revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% and 16%, respectively. Importantly, these results were achieved almost entirely through organic growth on assets that we owned as of April 1, 2008. Furthermore, we expect net new tenant additions to be significantly higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half of 2009. In fact, application volume in the second quarter of 2009 was up 30% over application activity in the second quarter of 2008, which we expect to translate into revenue growth in the second half of the year. This activity is driven, in part, by the growing mobile Internet. Based on the strong results in the first half of the year, including the new tenant application volume, and our expectations for the second half of 2009, we have raised our full year 2009 Outlook, which now suggests annual site rental revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% and 14%, respectively."
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS
Site rental revenues for second quarter 2009 increased $27.9 million, or 8%, to $376.4 million from $348.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Site rental gross margin, defined as site rental revenues less site rental cost of operations, increased 12% to $263.1 million, up $28.3 million in the second quarter of 2009 from $234.8 million in the same period in 2008. Adjusted EBITDA for second quarter 2009 increased $33.9 millionor 16%, to $246.9 million, up from $213.0 million for the same period in 2008.

News Release continued:
Recurring cash flow, defined as Adjusted EBITDA less interest expense less sustaining capital expenditures, increased from $119.2 million in the second quarter of 2008 to $131.5 million for the second quarter of 2009, up 10%. Recurring cash flow per share, defined as recurring cash flow divided by weighted average common shares outstanding, was $0.46 in the second quarter of 2009 compared to $0.43 in the second quarter of 2008, an increase of 8%.
For the second quarter of 2009, approximately 5% of Crown Castle's consolidated revenues were from its Australia subsidiary. Crown Castle's consolidated results were negatively impacted by the 19% decrease in the Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate from second quarter 2008 to second quarter 2009. Crown Castle's consolidated growth rates on a currency-neutral basis are as follows: site rental revenue 9%, site rental gross margin 13%, Adjusted EBITDA 17%, recurring cash flow 12%, and recurring cash flow per share 9%.
Net loss attributable to CCIC stockholders was $111.4 million for the second quarter of 2009, inclusive of $98.7 million of losses on purchases and early redemptions of debt and $59.5 million of unrealized losses on interest rate swaps, compared to a net income attributable to CCIC stockholders of $60.3 million for the same period in 2008, inclusive of the recognition of $74.9 million of tax benefits related to previously unrecognized US net operating losses. Net loss attributable to CCIC stockholders after deduction of dividends on preferred stock was $116.6 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to a net income attributable to CCIC stockholders after deduction of dividends on preferred stock of $55.1 million for the same period in 2008. Diluted second quarter 2009 net loss attributable to CCIC common stockholders per common share was $0.41, compared to a diluted net income attributable to CCIC common stockholders, after deduction of dividends on preferred stock, per common share of $0.19 in the second quarter of 2008.
SEGMENT RESULTS
US site rental revenues for the second quarter of 2009 increased $29.5 millionor 9%, to $358.5 million, compared to second quarter 2008 US site rental revenues of $329.0 million. US site rental gross margin increased 13%, or $29.1 million, in second quarter 2009 to $250.5 million from $221.5 million in the same period in 2008.

On a currency-neutral basis, Australia site rental revenues and site rental gross margin for second quarter 2009 grew 14% and 17% over second quarter 2008. Australia site rental revenues for the second quarter of 2009 were $17.9 million, compared to $19.6 million in the second quarter of 2008. Australia site rental gross margin for second quarter 2009 was $12.5 million, compared to $13.3 million in the second quarter 2008.
INVESTMENTS AND LIQUIDITY
"I am very pleased with our second quarter financial results, our ability to increase our Outlook for the balance of 2009 and the continued progress that we have made to improve our balance sheet," stated Jay Brown, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "As I've previously discussed, the primary goals of our refinancing efforts have been to extend our debt maturities, spread the debt maturities over multiple years and maintain flexibility to invest our cash flow while achieving the lowest possible interest cost. I believe that the recently announced financing of $250 million of structured notes by certain of our subsidiaries helps achieve all of these goals and potentially establishes an attractive template for future refinancings. Further, our 2009 financing activities have eliminated our requirement to access the credit markets for almost five years, as we are able to repay all of our debt maturities between now and 2014 with cash on-hand and anticipated cash flow."
During the second quarter of 2009, Crown Castle issued $1.2 billion of 7.75% senior secured notes due in 2017. The proceeds of these notes, combined with cash-on-hand, were used to repay, in full, the previously outstanding securitized notes due February 2011.
On July 20, 2009, Crown Castle priced, at par, $250 million of senior secured notes in two classes, A-1 and A-2. The Class A-1 Notes will consist of $175 million of 6.25% Notes and fully amortize during the period beginning in January 2010 and ending on the final maturity date in August 2019. The Class A-2 Notes will consist of $75 million of 9.0% Notes and fully amortize during the period beginning in September 2019 and ending on the final maturity date in August 2029. Crown Castle expects the $250 million notes to close on July 31, 2009. The proceeds are required to be used to repay, in full, the remaining $221.5 million outstanding of the Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-2, issued in 2004 by Global Signal Trust II and due in December 2009 ("December 2009 Notes"), which is net of the $72 million of notes that Crown Castle purchased in the open market during the first quarter of 2009.
 
News Release continued:
During the second quarter of 2009, Crown Castle purchased, at par, $15.8 million of the Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2005-1 due in June 2035 ("June 2035 Notes"). Since July 1, 2009, Crown Castle has purchased, at par, $180.4 million of the June 2035 Notes. Pro forma for these purchases, Crown Castle has $1,703.8 million of June 2035 Notes outstanding.
As of June 30, 2009, pro forma for the completion of the $250 million senior secured notes offering, and after taking into account the repayment of the December 2009 Notes and the aforementioned purchases in July by Crown Castle of the June 2035 Notes, Crown Castle expects to have approximately $177 million in cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) and $188 million of availability under its $188 million revolving credit facility.
During the second quarter of 2009, Crown Castle invested $39.6 million in capital expenditures, comprised of $5.1 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $34.5 million of revenue generating capital expenditures, of which $1.7 million was spent on land purchases, $28.2 million on existing sites, and $4.6 million on the construction and acquisition of new sites. Total capital expenditures were down approximately 72% from the same quarter in 2008.
In addition to the tables and information contained in this press release, Crown Castle will post supplemental information on its website at that will be discussed during its conference call tomorrow morning, Thursday, July 30, 2009.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on purchases and redemptions of debt, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest and other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. We define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or life of our revenue generating assets and include capitalized costs related to (i) maintenance activities on our towers, (ii) vehicles, (iii) information technology equipment, and (iv) office equipment. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
