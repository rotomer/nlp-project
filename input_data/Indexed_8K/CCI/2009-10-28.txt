ITEM 1.01  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On October 23, 2009, Crown Castle International Corp. ("Company") closed its previously announced public offering of $500 million principal amount of the Company's 7.125% Senior Notes due 2019 ("2019" Notes"). The 2019 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of January 27, 2009 ("Base Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee ("Trustee"), as supplemented by the second supplemental indenture, dated as of October 23, 2009 ("Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The Company is filing the Supplemental Indenture as Exhibit 4.1 to this report. By filing this report, the Company is causing this exhibit to be incorporated by reference herein and into the registration statement on Form S-3 filed on January 16, 2009 (File No. 333-156781). The Company filed the Base Indenture as an exhibit to its current report on Form 8-K filed on January 29, 2009 (File No. 001-16441).
The 2019 Notes are general obligations of the Company, which rank equally with all existing and future senior debt of the Company. The 2019 Notes will be effectively subordinated to all liabilities (including trade payables) of each subsidiary of the Company. The 2019 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 7.125% per annum, payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2010, to persons who are registered holders of the 2019 Notes on the immediately preceding April 15 and October 15, respectively.
The Indenture limits the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to make restricted payments, incur indebtedness, issue preferred stock, incur liens, create dividend restrictions and other payment restrictions that affect the Company's subsidiaries, sell assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and issue guarantees of indebtedness, in each case subject to certain qualifications set forth in the Indenture.
In the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the 2019 Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of the 2019 Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such 2019 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of such repurchase.
The 2019 Notes will mature on November 1, 2019. However, the Company, at its option, may redeem the 2019 Notes in whole or in part prior to November 1, 2014, by paying 100% of the principal amount of the 2019 Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus a "make whole" premium. The Company may also redeem some or all of the 2019 Notes on or after November 1, 2014, at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, before November 1, 2012, and subject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, redeem up to 35% of the 2019 Notes at the redemption price set forth in the Indenture with the proceeds of certain equity offerings by the Company.
The above description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Base Indenture, filed as an exhibit to the Company's current report on Form 8-K filed on January 29, 2009 (File No. 001-16441), and the Supplemental Indenture attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1.

(viii) except as provided in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 or in accordance with the terms of any Subsidiary Guarantee, release a Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee or make any change in a Subsidiary Guarantee that would adversely affect the Holders; or
(ix) make any change in the foregoing amendment and waiver provisions.

Compliance with Trust Indenture Act
Section 9.04 .

However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the
Revocation and Effect of Consents
 
consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.

(b) Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.
Section 9.06 . The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The Company may not sign an amended or supplemental indenture until the Board of Directors approves it.

Supplemental Indenture
Trustee,
 
No sinking fund is provided for the Notes.
 
(a) At any time prior to November 1, 2014, the Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, the redemption date.
(b) During the period after the date of original issuance of the Notes until November 1, 2012, the Company may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally issued at a redemption price of 107.125% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed on the redemption date with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; that:
provided
(1) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally issued remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption, excluding Notes held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and
(2) the redemption occurs within 90 days of the date of the closing of the Equity Offering.
(c) Except pursuant to the preceding paragraphs under this Paragraph 3, the Notes will not be redeemable at the Company's option prior to November 1, 2014. On or after November 1, 2014,
 
the Company may redeem all or a part of the Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices expressed as percentages of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes redeemed to the applicable redemption date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on November 1, of the years indicated below:
 
 
(a) If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes for redemption as follows:
(1) if the Notes are listed on any national securities exchange, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed; or
(2) if the Notes are not listed on any national securities exchange, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by a method that complies with approved legal and securities exchange requirements, if any, as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem fair and appropriate.
(b) No Notes of $2,000 of principal amount at maturity or less will be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. Notices of redemption may not be conditional.
 
(a) If a Change of Control occurs, each Holder of Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part, equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000, of such Holder's Notes (the "Change of Control Offer"). The offer price in any Change of Control Offer will be payable in cash and will be 101% of the aggregate principal amount of any Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes, if any (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase Notes on the date specified in the notice (the "Change of Control Payment Date"). The Change of Control Payment Date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date the notice is mailed, pursuant to the procedures required by the Supplemental Indenture and described in such notice.
 
(b) Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the Indenture (whether by election or the passage of time) will be deemed to constitute Excess Proceeds. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $25.0 million, the Company will be required to make an offer to all Holders of Notes, and all holders of other senior Indebtedness of the Company containing provisions similar to those set forth in the Indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other senior Indebtedness of the Company that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be payable in cash and will be 100% of the principal amount of any Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. In the case of any other senior Indebtedness, the offer price will be 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of purchase. Each Asset Sale Offer will be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Supplemental Indenture and the other senior Indebtedness of the Company. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company may use the remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and the other senior Indebtedness of the Company tendered into the Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee will select the Notes and such other senior Indebtedness to be purchased on a basis. Upon completion of the Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.
pro rata
 
(a) If any Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount at maturity of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount at maturity of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power.
(b) The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount at maturity of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on, or the principal of, the Notes (, , that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such acceleration).
provided
however
(c) The Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is known to the Trustee, the Trustee must mail to each Holder of the Notes notice of the Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Note, the
 
Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of its trust officers determines that withholding notice is not opposed to the interest of the Holders. In addition, the Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 90 days after the end of each Fiscal Year, an Officers' Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Company is also required to deliver to the Trustee, promptly after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event that constitutes or, with the given notice or passage of time or both, would constitute a Default or Event of Default, the status thereof and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.
 
The Supplemental Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of no less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past Defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note or such other Note.
 
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed or to convert this Note as provided in the Indenture.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to recover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
 
Prior to due presentation of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name the Note is registered, as the owner thereof for all purposes, whether or not such Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. Such waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Notes.
