Exhibit 99.1
November 3, 2009  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2009.
"We had another excellent quarter of record results, exceeding the high-end of our third quarter Outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and recurring cash flow," stated Ben Moreland, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "We are experiencing solid growth in our business and remain excited about the strong fundamentals underlying our industry, driven by the increasing demand for wireless communication services, including fourth generation wireless data services. Along with the third quarter results, we are announcing our full year 2010 Outlook, which suggests recurring cash flow growth of approximately 16%."
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS
Total revenue for the third quarter of 2009 increased 12% to $429.1 million from $384.3 million in the same period in 2008. Site rental revenue for the third quarter of 2009 increased $42.5 million, or 12%, to $396.5 million from $354.0 million for the same period in the prior year.

FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES
"I am very pleased with our third quarter results, our ability to increase our Outlook for the balance of 2009 and our continued successful financing activities," stated Jay Brown, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "Our recently completed $500 million of 7.125% senior notes, together with the $2.35 billion we refinanced earlier this year, have allowed us to extend our debt maturities over multiple years and eliminated any requirement to access the credit markets for almost five years. Furthermore, based on the improved credit markets, we believe our current refinancing options for the remaining portion of our debt have been greatly enhanced. As we look forward to 2010, I anticipate we will be in a position to resume investing the majority of our cash flow in activities, such as share purchases, tower acquisitions and land purchases that we believe will increase long-term recurring cash flow per share."
During the third quarter of 2009, Crown Castle issued $250 million of senior secured notes in two classes, A-1 and A-2. The Class A-1 Notes consist of $175 million of 6.25% Notes that fully amortize during the period beginning in January 2010 and ending on the final maturity date in August 2019. The Class A-2 Notes consist of $75 million of 9.0% Notes that fully amortize during the period beginning in September 2019 and ending on the final maturity date in August 2029. In July 2009, the proceeds of these notes were used to repay, in full, $221.5 million of previously outstanding Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-2, issued in 2004 by Global Signal Trust II and due in December 2009.
 
News Release continued:
Also, during the third quarter of 2009, Crown Castle purchased, at par, $186.5 million of the Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2005-1 due in June 2035 ("June 2035 Notes"). Since October 1, 2009, Crown Castle has purchased, at par, $6.3 million of the June 2035 Notes. Pro forma for these purchases, Crown Castle has $1,691.4 million of June 2035 Notes outstanding.
On October 20, 2009, Crown Castle issued $500 million of 7.125% senior notes due in 2019. The proceeds of these notes will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment or repurchase of certain outstanding indebtedness of its subsidiaries.
As of September 30, 2009, pro forma for the completion of the $500 million of 7.125% senior notes offering, and after taking into account the aforementioned purchases in October by Crown Castle of the June 2035 Notes, Crown Castle has approximately $750 million in cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) and $188 million of availability under its $188 million revolving credit facility.
During the third quarter of 2009, Crown Castle invested approximately $32.4 million in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were comprised of $5.5 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $26.9 million of revenue generating capital expenditures, of which $1.0 million was spent on land purchases, $21.2 million on existing sites and $4.7 million on the construction and acquisition of new sites.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on purchases and redemptions of debt, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest and other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. We define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or life of our revenue generating assets and include capitalized costs related to (i) maintenance activities on our towers, (ii) vehicles, (iii) information technology equipment, and (iv) office equipment. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
