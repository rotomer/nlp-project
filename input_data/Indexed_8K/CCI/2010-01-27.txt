Exhibit 99.1
January 27, 2010  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2009.
"Our excellent fourth quarter and full year results are only a small part of what Crown Castle accomplished during the last 12 months," stated Ben Moreland, President and Chief Executive Officer. "We began the year with four clear goals: first, to refinance maturing debt obligations into a properly laddered structure without incurring equity dilution; second, to maximize leasing opportunities through superior execution for customers; third, to reduce risk through deleveraging; and fourth, to position Crown Castle to return to allocating investment capital in a way that maximizes long-term recurring cash flow per share. Through the tireless efforts of our employees, Crown Castle distinguished itself by achieving each of these goals and more in 2009. We are very pleased with these results and look forward to 2010."

FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES
"I am very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results and the accomplishment of our previously stated refinancing goals to extend our debt maturities, spread the debt maturities over multiple years and maintain flexibility to invest our cash flow while achieving the lowest possible interest cost," stated Jay Brown, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "I believe that the recently completed financing of $1.9 billion of notes by certain of our subsidiaries contributed to the achievement of all of these goals, extending the maturities to five, seven and ten years and achieving a weighted average interest rate of 5.75%. Since the fourth quarter of 2008, we have raised $5.2 billion of debt and reduced our pro forma net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio from 6.6 times to 5.7 times. Further, we extended the weighted average years to expected maturity for debt we refinanced from approximately eighteen months to nearly eight years. I believe the result of our successful refinancing activities is that we have reduced our balance sheet risk and are well-positioned to resume investing our cash flow in activities, such as share purchases, tower acquisitions and land purchases, that we believe will enhance long-term growth in recurring cash flow per share."
During the fourth quarter of 2009, Crown Castle issued $500 million of 7.125% Senior Notes due 2019 and increased its revolving credit facility to $400 million while extending the maturity to September 30, 2013.
On January 15 2010, Crown Castle issued, at par, $1.9 billion of Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes ("January 2010 Notes") in three classes, C-2015, C-2017 and C-2020. The Class C-2015 notes consist of $300 million of notes having an interest rate of 4.5% and an expected life of five years with a final maturity date in January 2035. The Class C-2017 notes consist of $350 million of notes having an interest rate of 5.5% and an expected life of seven years with a final maturity date in January 2037. The Class C-2020 notes consist of $1.25 billion of notes having an interest rate of 6.1% and an expected life of ten years with a final maturity date in January 2040. The proceeds of these notes were used to repay in full the remaining $1.64 billion outstanding of the Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2005-1 ("June 2005 Notes"), which is net of the $261.0 million of such notes that Crown Castle purchased in the open market during 2009.
During the fourth quarter of 2009, Crown Castle purchased $59.1 million of the June 2005 Notes for $59.8 million. Since January 1, 2010, Crown Castle has purchased $461.3 million of its senior and senior secured notes. These purchases were comprised of $223.6 million face value of the Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2006-1 ("November 2006 Notes") (purchased for $236.4 million), $199.6 million face value of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes (purchased for $216.8 million), $33.1 million face value of the 9% Senior Notes (purchased for $35.9 million), and $5 million face value of the 2009-1, Class A-2 Notes (purchased for $5.3 million).

OUTLOOK
This Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein is set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
The following Outlook table is based on current expectations and assumptions. The Outlook table includes the interest expense associated with the $1.9 billion January 2010 Notes and assumes a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 0.88 US dollars to 1.00 Australian dollar for first quarter 2010 and full year 2010 Outlook.
The Outlook for full year 2010 interest expense includes approximately $38 million related to the amortization of certain non-cash charges for forward-starting interest rate swaps, predominately interest rate swaps associated with the June 2005 Notes ("2005 Swaps") that were entered into to hedge interest rate risk on the refinancing of the 2005 Notes. As described above, Crown Castle has issued $1.9 billion of 2010 Notes to refinance its 2005 Notes. The pricing of the 2010 Notes occurred on January 8, 2010. The 2005 Swaps had a fair value of $155.3 million upon cessation of hedge accounting for such swaps, which occurred primarily on January 8, 2010. The non-cash interest charge of $38 million, included in the 2010 Outlook, primarily represents the 2010 amortization portion of the fair value of the 2005 Swaps when hedge accounting ceased. The 2005 Swaps have not yet cash settled. The actual cash settlement amount for the 2005 Swaps will not be determined until the settlement date of the 2005 Swaps, which have a contractual settlement date of June 15, 2010. The non-cash interest charge related to the 2005 Swaps will not change regardless of the actual settlement amount of the 2005 Swaps. Further, any differential between the settlement value and the fair value on January 8, 2010 of the 2005 Swaps will be recorded to other income (expense) and will not impact interest expense.
 
News Release continued:
For the purposes of this Outlook, interest expense is based on debt outstanding as of January 27, 2010.
The following table sets forth Crown Castle's current Outlook for the first quarter of 2010 and full year 2010:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on purchases and redemptions of debt, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest and other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. We define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or life of our revenue generating assets and include capitalized costs related to (i) maintenance activities on our towers, (ii) vehicles, (iii) information technology equipment, and (iv) office equipment. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
