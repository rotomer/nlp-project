FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 28, 2010  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2010.
"We had a very good first quarter, exceeding the midpoint of our Outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and recurring cash flow," stated Ben Moreland, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "We continue to see significant tenant activity, particularly related to the deployment of mobile data services. Based on our strong first quarter results and our expectations for the rest of 2010, we have raised our full year 2010 Outlook, which now suggests annual site rental revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% and 11%, respectively. Longer term, I am excited about Crown Castle's position relative to the deployment of the mobile Internet across a number of devices and wireless networks. With the largest tower portfolio in the most populated cities in the US and the highest level of customer service in our industry, we have a unique ability to benefit from the growth in mobile data services. In the last couple of quarters, we have begun to see early signs of these mobile data deployments in our results, and I believe significant opportunities lie ahead."
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS
Total revenues for the first quarter of 2010 increased 10% to $444.3 million from $402.9 million in the same period in 2009. Site rental revenues for first quarter 2010 increased $39.2 million, or 11%, to $406.9 million from $367.7 million for the same period in the prior year.

INVESTMENTS AND LIQUIDITY
"I am very pleased with our operating results and investment and financing activities thus far in 2010," stated Jay Brown, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "During January 2010, we were able to refinance approximately 30% of our outstanding indebtedness at a weighted average annual interest rate of 5.75% with a weighted average expected maturity of 8.7 years. The completion of this refinancing enabled us to return to investing our capital in the purchase of our common shares, as well as increase the purchases of land beneath our towers. We remain focused on investing our cash flow on activities that we believe will maximize long-term recurring cash flow per share. Further, given the strong performance of our business in the first quarter of 2010 and our expectations for the second half of 2010, we have increased our 2010 Outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow."
On January 15, 2010, Crown Castle issued, at par, $1.9 billion of Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes. These notes were issued at a weighted average interest rate of 5.75%. The proceeds of these notes were used to repay in full the $1.64 billion outstanding of the Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2005-1. Furthermore, in the first quarter, Crown Castle purchased $461.7 million of senior and senior secured notes issued by it and certain of its subsidiaries. A summary of our current debt outstanding is set forth below under "Other Calculations."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Calculations
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on purchases and redemptions of debt, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest and other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. We define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or life of our revenue generating assets and include capitalized costs related to (i) maintenance activities on our towers, (ii) vehicles, (iii) information technology equipment, and (iv) office equipment. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.

Adjusted EBITDA, recurring cash flow and recurring cash flow per share for the quarters ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 are computed as follows
