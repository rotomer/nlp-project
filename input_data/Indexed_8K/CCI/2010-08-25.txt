ITEM 1.01  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On August 16, 2010, Crown Castle Towers LLC ("Issuer Entity") and certain of its direct subsidiaries issued $1,550,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes ("Offered Notes") as additional debt securities under the Indenture dated as of June 1, 2005 (as amended, "Indenture"), by and among the Issuer Entity, Crown Castle South LLC, Crown Communication Inc., Crown PT Inc., Crown Communication New York, Inc., Crown Castle International Corp. de Puerto Rico, Crown Castle Towers 05 LLC, Crown Castle PR LLC, Crown Castle MU LLC, Crown MUPA LLC (collectively, "Issuers") and The Bank of New York Mellon (as successor to The Bank of New York as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.), as trustee ("Indenture Trustee"), pursuant to which the Issuers previously issued the Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2006-1 ("2006-1 Notes") and the Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2010-1, Series 2010-2 and Series 2010-3 ("Outstanding 2010 Notes" and, together with the 2006-1 Notes, the Offered Notes and any other notes issued under the Indenture, "Notes"). The Offered Notes were issued pursuant to three indenture supplements each dated as of August 16, 2010 ("Indenture Supplements"), by and among the Issuers and the Indenture Trustee. All the Issuers are indirect subsidiaries of Crown Castle International Corp. ("Company"). The Offered Notes constitute three new Series of Notes under the Indenture and were issued in three separate Classes set forth in the table below. Each Class of Offered Notes will rank with each other Class of Notes of any other Series issued under the Indenture (including the Outstanding 2010 Notes) that bears the same alphabetical Class designation. Each of the Class C Notes are subordinated in right of payment to any other Class which has an earlier alphabetical designation. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture.

passu
 
The Notes (including the Offered Notes) are guaranteed by CC Towers Guarantor LLC ("Guarantor"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the direct parent of the Issuer Entity. The Guarantor's only material asset is its equity interest in the Issuer Entity. The Notes are obligations solely of the Issuers and are not guaranteed by the Company or any affiliate of the Company other than the Guarantor.
The Notes (including the Offered Notes) will be paid solely from the cash flows generated from operation of the Tower Sites held directly and indirectly by the Issuers. The Issuers are special purpose entities that are prohibited from owning any assets other than their Tower Sites and related assets and from incurring any debt other than as contemplated by the Indenture. Under the Indenture, the Issuers and their subsidiaries will be permitted to issue new and additional notes under certain circumstances, including so long as the Debt Service Coverage Ratio of the Issuers is at least 2.00x. As of April 30, 2010, the Issuers and their subsidiaries owned, leased, subleased or managed 11,744 Tower Sites in the United States and Puerto Rico.
The Notes (including the Offered Notes) are secured by a first priority security interest granted by the Issuers in all of their assignable personal property, the space licenses pursuant to which wireless communication companies or other users lease space on the Tower Sites and the revenues associated with the space licenses. The equity interests in each of the Issuers and their respective subsidiaries have also been pledged to secure repayment of the Notes. Approximately 4,861 Tower Sites are held by Crown Atlantic Company LLC ("Crown Atlantic") and Crown Castle GT Company LLC ("Crown GT"), indirect subsidiaries of the Issuer Entity, whose governing instruments generally prevent them from issuing debt and granting liens on their assets without the approval of certain subsidiaries of Verizon Communications. Consequently, while distributions paid to the Issuers by Crown Atlantic and Crown GT will service the Notes, the Notes are not obligations of, nor are the Notes secured by the cash flows or any other assets of, Crown Atlantic and Crown GT.
 
The Series 2010-4, Class C-2015 Notes, Series 2010-5, Class C-2017 Notes and Series 2010-6, Class C-2020 Notes have a stated maturity date of August 15, 2035, August 15, 2037, and August 15, 2040, respectively. No principal payments in respect of the Series 2010-4, Class C-2015 Notes, Series 2010-5, Class C-2017 Notes and Series 2010-6, Class C-2020 Notes are required to be made prior to August 15, 2015, August 15, 2017, or August 15, 2020, respectively, unless an Amortization Period commences, certain casualty or condemnation events occur or any Notes are not paid in full on or prior to the Anticipated Repayment Date for such Notes; provided that principal payments will be required to be made only with respect to those Series of Notes for which the Anticipate Repayment Date has occurred (and not with respect to any other Series of Notes for which the Anticipated Repayment Date for such Series has not occurred). During an Amortization Period, Excess Cash Flow of the Issuers will be used to repay principal with respect to all Notes in the manner set forth in the Indenture. An Amortization Period will commence as of the end of any calendar quarter if the Debt Service Coverage Ratio of the Issuers falls below 1.45x and will continue to exist until the end of any calendar quarter for which such ratio exceeds such level. In addition, with respect to each Series of Notes from and after the Anticipated Repayment Date for such Series of Notes (and not with respect to any other Series of Notes in respect of which the Anticipated Repayment Date has not occurred), additional interest will accrue at a per annum rate equal to the greater of 5% and the rate computed pursuant to the formula specified in the Indenture. If an Amortization Period is not in effect but the Anticipated Repayment Date for a Series of Notes has occurred, Excess Cash Flow of the Issuers will be used to repay principal with respect to such Series of Notes in the manner set forth in the Indenture.
During the continuation of a Cash Trap Condition, all Excess Cash Flow will be deposited in a Cash Trap Reserve Sub-Account established under the Indenture. Prior to the earliest Anticipated Repayment Date for any Series of Notes then outstanding, if a Cash Trap Condition is continuing and the Debt Service Coverage Ratio of the Issuers is 1.75x or greater and no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, funds in the Cash Trap Reserve may be released to be used solely to meet the debt service requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries (other than CC Towers Holding, the immediate parent of the Guarantor, and CC Towers Holding's subsidiaries). A Cash Trap Condition will exist at the end of any calendar quarter if the Debt Service Coverage Ratio of the Issuers is 1.75x or less and will continue to exist until such ratio exceeds such level for two consecutive calendar quarters. Under the terms of the Indenture, there are generally no restrictions on the Company's use of cash distributed to it from the Issuers after debt service, provided investments are made in a Permitted Business, which includes any type of business that the Company and its subsidiaries presently conduct and any type of business that is related, ancillary, or complementary to such presently conducted business.
Crown Castle Atlantic LLC and Crown Castle GT Holding Sub LLC, the holders of the equity interests in Crown Atlantic and Crown GT, and the Issuers (collectively, "Owners") are parties to a management agreement dated as of June 8, 2005 (as amended, "Management Agreement") with Crown Castle USA Inc., as manager ("Manager"). The Manager is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Manager performs, on behalf of the Asset Entities, those functions reasonably necessary to maintain, market, operate, manage and administer the Tower Sites.
The Owners, the Indenture Trustee and Manager are also parties to a cash management agreement dated as of June 8, 2005 (as amended, "Cash Management Agreement"). Pursuant to the Cash Management Agreement, the Indenture Trustee administers the reserve funds in the manner set forth in the Indenture. Pursuant to the Servicing Agreement between Midland Loan Services, Inc. ("Servicer") and the Indenture Trustee dated as of June 8, 2005 ("Servicing Agreement"), the Servicer administers and oversees the performance by the Issuers and the Manager of their respective obligations under the Transaction Documents.
The Company used the net proceeds received from the issuance of the Offered Notes to repay in full the Series 2006-1 Notes, together with related prepayment premiums, fees and expenses.
The above summary of the Indenture, the Management Agreement, the Cash Management Agreement, the Servicing Agreement and the Indenture Supplements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms and provisions of the Indenture, the Management Agreement, the Cash Management Agreement and the Servicing Agreement previously filed by the Company on Form 8-K on June 8, 2005, the amendment to the Management Agreement previously filed by the Company on Form 8-K on September 28, 2006, the Joinder and Amendment to Management Agreement and the Joinder to Cash Management Agreement filed by the Company on Form 8-K on December 5, 2006, and the three Indenture Supplements filed herewith as Exhibit 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.
