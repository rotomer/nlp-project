Exhibit 99.1
October 27, 2010  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2010.
"We had another excellent quarter as our results exceeded the high-end of our third quarter Outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and recurring cash flow, and we closed the previously announced acquisition of NewPath Networks," stated Ben Moreland, President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown Castle. "As reflected in our 2010 and 2011 Outlook, we continue to experience solid growth in our business and remain excited about the strong fundamentals underlying our industry, driven by increasing network demand from integrated devices and the move toward fourth generation wireless data services. Further, as a core part of our strategy, we seek to invest our capital in activities we expect will maximize recurring cash flow per share. We remain disciplined as we pursue augmenting our organic growth through investments such as tower acquisitions, new site construction and share purchases."

Total revenue for the third quarter of 2010 increased 12% to $481.9 million from $429.1 million in the same period in 2009. Site rental revenue for the third quarter of 2010 increased $40.6 million, or 10%, to $437.1 million from $396.5 million for the same period in the prior year.

Recurring cash flow, defined as Adjusted EBITDA less interest expense and sustaining capital expenditures, increased 24% from $143.8 million in the third quarter of 2009 to $177.8 million for the third quarter of 2010. Weighted average common shares outstanding was 286.1 million for the third quarter of 2010, as compared to 286.7 million for the same period in the prior year. Recurring cash flow per share, defined as recurring cash flow divided by weighted average common shares outstanding, was $0.62 in the third quarter of 2010, up 24% compared to $0.50 in the third quarter of 2009.
Net loss attributable to CCIC stockholders was $135.0 million for the third quarter of 2010, inclusive of $104.4 million of net losses from interest rate swaps and $71.9 million of net losses from repayments, purchases and early retirement of debt, compared to a net loss of $31.6 million for the same period in 2009, inclusive of $58.3 million of net losses from interest rate swaps.

Third quarter 2010 net loss attributable to CCIC common stockholders after deduction of dividends on preferred stock per common share was $0.49, compared to $0.13 in the third quarter of 2009.
FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES
On August 15, 2010, Crown Castle issued, at par, $1.55 billion of Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes. These notes were issued at a weighted average interest rate of 4.48%. The proceeds of these notes were used to repay in full the remaining $1.33 billion outstanding of Senior Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2006-1.
"I am very pleased with the successful refinancing we accomplished in August and our third quarter results," stated Jay Brown, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "Our significant outperformance in the third quarter was aided by a modification to a customer's lease agreement, which resulted in an increase in its rent in exchange for rights to additional antenna space relating to amendment activity on towers it currently leases. As such, we achieved a meaningful step-up in recurring site rental revenue commencing in the third quarter. As I look forward, I am excited about the strength of our balance sheet and the significant amount of cash that we expect to produce and deploy in activities, such as share purchases, tower acquisitions and land purchases, that we believe will increase long-term recurring cash flow per share."

During the third quarter of 2010, Crown Castle invested $56.5 million in capital expenditures, comprised of $26.1 million of land purchases, $5.1 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $25.2 million of revenue generating capital expenditures, the latter consisting of $22.1 million on existing sites and $3.1 million on the construction of new sites. Additionally, during the third quarter we closed the previously announced acquisition of NewPath Networks for $128 million, inclusive of construction-in-progress.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Calculations
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on purchases and redemptions of debt, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest and other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. We define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or life of our revenue generating assets and include capitalized costs related to (i) maintenance activities on our towers, (ii) vehicles, (iii) information technology equipment, and (iv) office equipment. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.

Adjusted EBITDA, recurring cash flow and recurring cash flow per share for the quarters ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 are computed as follows
