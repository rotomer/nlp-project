Exhibit 99.1
January 26, 2011  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2010.
"We had an excellent fourth quarter and full year 2010, growing site rental revenue and recurring cash flow from 2009 to 2010, by 10% and 22%, respectively, reflecting the continued strong underlying growth in the business," stated Ben Moreland, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our U.S. services business also performed exceptionally well, with service revenues up 25%, compared to full year 2009. In addition to excellent financial results in 2010, we refinanced approximately $3.5 billion of debt, accomplishing our goal of refinancing our near-term debt into an appropriately laddered maturity structure. Further, during 2010, we closed our acquisition of NewPath Networks, one of the leading providers of distributed antenna systems networks, furthering our ability to extend wireless infrastructure to customers beyond those areas served by traditional towers, and broadening our service offering in this growing market. Finally, following the completion of our refinancing efforts, we resumed allocating investment capital in a way that we believe will maximize long-term recurring cash flow per share, including by purchasing our common shares, by increasing purchases of land beneath our towers, and through our acquisition of NewPath. In summary, I am very pleased with our 2010 accomplishments and am excited going into 2011 as growing consumer demand for mobile Internet drives the need for our customers to lease additional space on our towers."

Crown Castle spent $12.7 million during the fourth quarter to purchase its common shares at an average price of $42.42 per share. Diluted common shares outstanding at December 31, 2010 were 288.1 million. Since January 2003, Crown Castle has spent $2.4 billion to purchase approximately 92.6 million of its common shares and potential shares, at an average price of $25.65 per share.
In addition, during fourth quarter 2010, Crown Castle used $431.0 million of cash, including $157.0 million borrowed under its revolving credit facility, to settle all of its forward-starting interest rate swaps that were due to be settled during 2011. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2010, Crown Castle is no longer a party to any forward-starting interest rate swaps.
Crown Castle had approximately $112.5 million in cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) and $243.0 million of availability under its revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2010.
"I am very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results," stated Jay Brown, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "As we look forward to our plans for 2011, I am excited about the anticipated growth in our business and the opportunity to make investments in activities we believe will maximize long-term recurring cash flow per share. For the full year 2011, we expect to produce approximately $730 million of recurring cash flow, of which we anticipate spending approximately $275 million on capital expenditures related to the purchase of land beneath our towers, the addition of tenants to our towers and the construction of new sites, including Distributed Antenna Systems. The remaining portion of the recurring cash flow represents approximately $115 million per quarter of cash flow that I expect will be available to invest in activities around our core business, including reducing common shares outstanding and acquisitions. I believe the combination of growth in our core business driven by wireless data deployments and the investment of our expected cash flow will continue to enhance long-term recurring cash flow per share."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on purchases and redemptions of debt, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest and other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. We define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or life of our revenue generating assets and include capitalized costs related to (i) maintenance activities on our towers, (ii) vehicles, (iii) information technology equipment, and (iv) office equipment. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures.
