(e) . On February 10, 2011, the Board, upon recommendation from the Compensation Committee, approved the Crown Castle 2011 EMT Annual Incentive Plan ("2011 Incentive Plan") for the Company's executive management team ("EMT"), including W. Benjamin Moreland, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and the Company's other executive officers. The 2011 Incentive Plan is intended to provide incentives to members of the Company's EMT in the form of cash payments for achieving certain performance goals established under the 2011 Incentive Plan. Under the 2011 Incentive Plan, each eligible participant has an assigned target bonus level, expressed as a percent of base salary. Depending on the achievement of specified levels of corporate and business unit financial performance goals and individual performance goals, each eligible participant may earn a multiple of the target bonus. The Board's approval of the 2011 Incentive Plan does not create a guarantee of an incentive award to any eligible participant, and the Compensation Committee retains discretion to discontinue or amend the 2011 Incentive Plan at any time. A copy of the 2011 Incentive Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K.

Executive Officer Compensation
The terms of the 2011 Time Vest RSAs shown in the table above provide that one-third of the shares underlying such RSAs vest (i.e., the forfeiture and transfer restrictions lapse) on February 19 of each of 2012, 2013 and 2014.
The terms of the 2011 Performance RSAs shown in the table above provide for 0% to 100% of the shares underlying such RSAs to vest on February 19, 2014 ("Price Performance Date") based upon the highest average closing price per share of the Company's common stock ("Common Stock") for 20 consecutive trading days during the period commencing August 24, 2013 and ending on (and including) the Price Performance Date ("Highest Average Price"). If the Highest Average Price achieved equals $52.51*, $60.37* or $68.99*, then the percentage of the 2011 Performance RSAs which vests on the Price Performance Date is 33 1/3%, 66 2/3% or 100%, respectively. If the Highest Average Price achieved falls between $52.51*, $60.37* and $68.99*, then the percentage of 2011 Performance RSAs which vests is determined on a pro rata basis as follows:
 
In addition, if the closing share price of the Common Stock ("Closing Price") is at or above $52.51* on the Price Performance Date and none of the vesting criteria described above has yet been satisfied, then 33 1/3% of the 2011 Performance RSAs will vest if and upon the closing share price of the Common Stock being at or above $52.51* for a period of 20 consecutive trading days that includes the Price Performance Date.
The 2011 Time Vest RSAs and 2010 Performance RSAs were granted pursuant to the Company's 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended ("2004 Stock Incentive Plan"). A form of standard Restricted Stock Agreement generally used for the Company's 2004 Stock Incentive Plan is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to the Company's Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2005.

st
The Company hereby adopts the terms of the Plan as follows:
Section 1. Objectives

Section 2. Plan Year
The effective date of this Plan is January 1, 2011. The Plan will remain in effect from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2011 (the "Plan Year").
Section 3. Administration
The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") with oversight by the Board. The Committee shall have the authority to review and approve: (a) the Participants as defined in Section 4, (b) the incentive opportunities for each Participant as defined in Section 6, (c) the methodology for determining the Performance Goals as defined in Section 7, (d) the minimum performance requirements as described in Section 8, and (e) the final Incentive Awards for the Participants as described in Section 9.

Section 4. Eligibility
Executive employees who are selected by the CEO, and are approved by the Committee, will be eligible to participate in the Plan (the "Participants").
Section 5. Change in Eligibility Status

Section 6. Incentive Opportunity
The CEO will determine, and recommend for approval by the Committee, incentive opportunities for each Participant. The incentive opportunities will be defined as Incentive Opportunity Zones that represent a range of threshold, target and maximum performance outcomes for which incremental increases in performance will result in incremental increases in the Incentive Award.
Each Incentive Opportunity Zone will include threshold, target and maximum incentive opportunities. The Participant's target incentive opportunity will be based on the Participant's role and responsibilities, and will be expressed as a percentage of the Participant's base salary. The Participant's threshold and maximum incentive opportunities will be expressed as a Payout Multiple of the target incentive opportunity and will also be based on the Participant's role and responsibilities. The tables set forth on outline the target Payout Multiples for certain Participant categories.
Exhibit A
The target incentive opportunity as a multiple of base salary, and the resulting threshold and maximum opportunities will be determined and approved in writing and kept on file for each Participant in the appropriate Human Resources department.
Section 7. Performance Goals
Each Participant shall have specific performance goals (the "Performance Goals") determined for his or her position for the Plan Year. These Performance Goals will be based on certain financial and nonfinancial performance measures that support the approved business plan of the Company and/or business unit, and should identify how the Participant will support the achievement of such goals.
Two performance categories will generally be used for each Participant:
The Performance Goals for these financial measures will generally be based on the Company's 2011 financial budget/forecasts as approved by the Board.
The target mix and weighting of the Performance Goals for each Participant will vary depending on the Participant's role and responsibilities, as set forth on .
Exhibit B

The threshold, target, and maximum Performance Goals for these financial measures, based on the Company's budget/forecast for 2011 are set forth on .
Exhibit C
The threshold, target and maximum individual Performance Goals will be based on how well the Participant met the goals established using the Company's annual performance management system. The Individual Performance Goals will be aligned within the Participant's applicable Incentive Opportunity Zone. While the interpretation of how well the Individual Performance Goals are met will be more subjective than for financial measures, the following descriptions will be used to interpret individual performance:
Section 8. Minimum Performance Requirements
There are three minimum performance requirements in order to receive a full Annual Incentive in accordance with the Plan:

The target Incentive Opportunity Curves for each of the Performance Goals are set forth on .
