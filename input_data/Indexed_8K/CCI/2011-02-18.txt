This Current Report on
Form 8-K/A
amends Item 4.01 of the Current Report on
Form 8-K
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 13, 2010, regarding a change in the Registrant's certifying accountant.
ITEM 4.01  CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT
On December 8, 2010, the Audit Committee of Crown Castle International Corp. ("Company") approved the dismissal of KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as the Company's independent registered public accountants. KPMG's engagement as the Company's independent registered public accountants with respect to the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 ended upon the filing of the Company's Form 10-K on February 15, 2011. In addition, on December 8, 2010, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the Company's independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011.
The audit reports of KPMG on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 did not contain any adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. The audit reports of KPMG on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
During the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the subsequent interim period through February 15, 2011, (1) there were no disagreements with KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure that, if not resolved to KPMG's satisfaction, would have caused KPMG to make reference in connection with its opinion to the subject matter of the disagreement and (2) there were no "reportable events" as defined in item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the subsequent interim period through the date of the filing of this Form 8-K/A, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted PwC regarding either (1) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and no written report or oral advice was provided to the Company that PwC concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue or (2) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement or reportable event as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(a)(1)(iv) and Item 304(a)(1)(v), respectively.
The Company provided KPMG with a copy of this Current Report on Form 8-K/A prior to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and requested that KPMG furnish a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees with the statements made herein. A copy of KPMG's letter is filed as Exhibit 16.1 hereto.

Securities and Exchange Commission Washington, D.C. 20549
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We were previously principal accountants for Crown Castle International Corp. (the Company) and, under the date of February 15, 2011, we reported on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. On December 8, 2010, we were notified that the Company engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as its principal accountant for the year ending December 31, 2011 and that the auditor-client relationship with KPMG LLP will cease upon completion of the audit of the Companys consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, and the issuance of our reports thereon. On February 15, 2011, we completed our audit and the auditor-client relationship ceased. We have read the Companys statements included under Item 4.01 of its Form 8-K/A dated February 18, 2011, and we agree with such statements, except that we are not in a position to agree or disagree with the Companys statement that during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the subsequent interim periods through the filing of its Form 8-K/A, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted PwC regarding either (1) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Companys financial statements, or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and no written report or oral advice was provided to the Company that PwC concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue, or (2) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement or reportable event as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(a)(1)(iv) and Item 304(a)(1)(v), respectively.
Very truly yours,
