March 21, 2011  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today announced certain contractual terms in light of AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA. As of December 31, 2010, AT&T and T-Mobile represented 21% and 11%, respectively, of Crown Castle's consolidated revenues. Further, there are approximately 4,000 Crown Castle towers on which both carriers currently reside. Crown Castle's revenue from T-Mobile on these 4,000 towers represents approximately 6% of Crown Castle's consolidated revenues. In addition, there is an average of approximately 12 years and 7 years of current term remaining on all lease agreements with AT&T and T-Mobile, respectively.
As previously disclosed, Crown Castle expects to have during 2011 approximately $460 million of investment capacity, before accessing any external financing, that could be invested in activities related to its core business, including share purchases, acquisitions and new site construction.
Crown Castle owns, operates, and leases towers and other infrastructure for wireless communications. Crown Castle offers significant wireless communications coverage to 92 of the top 100 US markets and to substantially all of the Australian population.
