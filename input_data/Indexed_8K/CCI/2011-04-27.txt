Exhibit 99.1
April 27, 2011  HOUSTON, TEXAS  Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.
"We had a good first quarter, exceeding our Outlook for site rental revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow," stated Ben Moreland, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Site rental revenue grew 10%, adjusted for non-recurring items, and US services revenues grew 14%, compared to the same period in 2010. I am excited about our position relative to the deployment of the mobile Internet across a number of devices and wireless networks. With the largest tower portfolio in the most populated cities in the US and the highest level of customer service in our industry, we have a unique ability to benefit from the growth in mobile data services. We are benefiting from these mobile data deployments in our results, and I believe it is still early days in this next generation of wireless demand."

Total revenue for the first quarter of 2011 increased 12% to $499 million from $444 million in the same period in 2010.

Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding were 289.0 million for the first quarter of 2011, compared to 288.5 million for the same period in the prior year.

FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES
"We are pleased to have resumed purchasing our common shares, investing approximately 30% of our first quarter 2011 recurring cash flow in this activity," stated Jay Brown, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "Further, we continue to see attractive investment opportunities in our distributed antenna systems business and believe this has the potential to be a meaningful component of our long-term organic revenue growth. In the near term, consistent with some of the recent announcements by US wireless operators, the vast majority of our leasing activity is coming from the two largest wireless carriers in the US and a large number of relatively small wireless operators. Our full year 2011 Outlook assumes that the leasing activity for the balance of 2011 remains similar to the activity that we saw in the first quarter. We believe that we are likely to see an increase in leasing activity as we enter 2012, as well as an increase in the diversity of customers for that leasing activity. As shown in our 2011 Outlook, we expect to produce an additional $540 million of recurring cash flow for the balance of 2011, which we expect to invest in activities that we believe will maximize long-term cash flow per share."
During the first quarter of 2011, Crown Castle invested approximately $52 million in capital expenditures, comprised of $22 million of land purchases, $3 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $27 million of revenue generating capital expenditures, the latter consisting of $16 million on existing sites and $11 million on the construction of new sites.
 
Also, during the first quarter of 2011, Crown Castle purchased approximately 1.0 million of its common shares using $42.2 million in cash at an average price of $41.14 per share. In addition, in April 2011, Crown Castle purchased approximately 0.2 million of its common shares using $10.3 million in cash at an average price of $41.86 per share. Pro forma for the common shares purchased in April 2011, diluted common shares outstanding at March 31, 2011 were 288.9 million. Since January 2003, Crown Castle has spent $2.4 billion to purchase approximately 93.9 million of its common shares and potential shares, at an average price of $25.86 per share.
Crown Castle repaid $50 million of the revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2011. Since April 1, 2011, Crown Castle has repaid an additional $15 million of the revolving credit facility. Pro forma for the purchase of its common shares, and after taking into account the aforementioned revolver repayments, Crown Castle had approximately $57 million in cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) as of March 31, 2011, and $308 million of availability under its revolving credit facility.
IMPACT OF NON-RECURRING ITEMS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE
First quarter 2011 site rental revenue benefited from $6.7 million in unexpected, non-recurring items comprised primarily of the non-cash impact related to licenses that were expected to, but did not, terminate as a result of carrier consolidation, and a termination fee related to a take-or-pay arrangement with a customer. In addition, site rental revenue also benefited by $2.6 million due to an 11% increase in the Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate compared to our Outlook for exchange rates provided in January 2011. Further, first quarter 2011 Adjusted EBITDA benefited from the aforementioned $6.7 million in non-recurring items and $2 million due to the increase in the Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Calculations
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on purchases and redemptions of debt, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest and other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. We define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or life of our revenue generating assets and include capitalized costs related to (i) maintenance activities on our towers, (ii) vehicles, (iii) information technology equipment, and (iv) office equipment. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.
