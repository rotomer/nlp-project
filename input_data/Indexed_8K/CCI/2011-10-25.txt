"We had an excellent third quarter, exceeding the high-end of our Outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow," stated Ben Moreland, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Further, the contribution from the network services portion of our business exceeded our expectations, delivering the highest contribution to gross margin in its history. As a result of our strong performance, we have increased our full year 2011 Outlook, which now suggests annual recurring cash flow per share growth of 18% compared to 2010. As I look forward to the balance of the year and to 2012, we are excited to be assisting with and benefiting from significant network upgrades by the three largest carriers, each of which is adding capacity to create a higher quality mobile Internet experience."

FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES
"I am very pleased with our third quarter results, our ability to increase our Outlook for the balance of 2011 and our continued investment in activities such as share purchases and land acquisitions," stated Jay Brown, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "During the third quarter, we invested approximately $280 million in activities around our core business. We believe such investments strengthen our business and maximize long-term recurring cash flow per share, which we believe is the best measure of shareholder value creation. Since 2007, we have grown recurring cash flow per share by approximately 19% annually."
During the third quarter of 2011, Crown Castle purchased 3.0 million of its common shares and potential shares using $123.8 million in cash at an average price of $40.85 per share. These purchases were comprised of 2.7 million of common shares using $108.8 million in cash at an average price of $40.42 and $15.0 million of 6.25% preferred shares, reducing potential common shares by 0.3 million. Diluted common shares outstanding at September 30, 2011 were 282.8 million. Since January 2003, Crown Castle has spent $2.7 billion to purchase 100.3 million of its common shares and potential shares, at an average price of $26.84 per share.
During the
third
quarter of 2011, Crown Castle invested approximately
$148 million
in capital expenditures, comprised of
$111 million
of land purchases (including an $89 million purchase of our ground leases in a single transaction),

of sustaining capital expenditures and

$20 million

in cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) and $145 million of availability under its revolving credit facility.
OUTLOOK
    
This Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein is set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
The following Outlook table is based on current expectations and assumptions and assumes a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 1.0 US dollar to 1.0 Australian dollar for fourth quarter 2011, full year 2011 and 2012 Outlook.
As reflected in the following table, Crown Castle has increased the midpoint of its full year 2011 Outlook, previously issued on July 27, 2011, for site rental revenue by $7 million, site rental gross margin by $9 million, Adjusted EBITDA by $18 million and recurring cash flow by $17 million.
The Outlook for full year 2012 assumes site rental revenue growth of approximately $90 million, wholly comprised of anticipated new leasing activity in the form of new installations and amendments to existing installations. This growth in site rental revenue from new leasing is approximately equivalent to our full year expectations for 2011. The 2012 Outlook for site rental revenue does not assume any contribution to growth from the existing base of business as revenue from contractual rental increases is offset by higher expected churn, specifically related to Alltel licenses Verizon is expected to terminate as a result of its acquisition of Alltel. The impact of the churn is increased by the expectation that it will occur mostly in the first six months of 2012. Further, the Outlook does not assume any benefit from significant customer lease extensions in 2012.
The following table sets forth Crown Castle's current Outlook for the fourth quarter 2011, full year 2011 and full year 2012:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Calculations
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on purchases and redemptions of debt, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest and other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)).
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures. Each of the amounts included in the calculation of recurring cash flow are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP. We define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures (determined in accordance with GAAP) which do not increase the capacity or life of our revenue generating assets and include capitalized costs related to (i) maintenance activities on our towers, (ii) vehicles, (iii) information technology equipment, and (iv) office equipment. Recurring cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations or operating results (as determined in accordance with GAAP).
Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations. Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA and recurring cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector. The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.
