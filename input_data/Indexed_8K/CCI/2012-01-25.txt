CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL
REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR
2011
RESULTS
2011 Highlights and Recent Developments
Acquisition of growth-enhancing strategic assets
Positioned as US wireless infrastructure leader
Record level of revenue and Adjusted EBITDA
January 25, 2012 - HOUSTON, TEXAS - Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31,
2011
.
"We had an excellent fourth quarter and full year 2011, growing site rental revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted funds from operations ("AFFO") for the full year 2011, by 9%, 12%, and 17%, respectively," stated Ben Moreland, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Further, we announced an agreement to acquire NextG Networks, the largest provider of distributed antenna systems ("DAS") in the US. Our acquisition of NextG positions us as the industry leader in DAS and builds on the DAS success we have already enjoyed. We expect DAS to be an increasingly important component of our future growth as small-cell architecture plays a vital role in meeting the capacity challenges posed by growing mobile data traffic. In addition, we announced the acquisitions of two portfolios of ground lease related assets, allowing us to build on our leading expertise in this area. Upon closing, we expect these contemplated acquisitions will further enhance our premier portfolio of wireless infrastructure assets in the US market, the largest, fastest growing and most profitable wireless market in the world by nearly every measure."

INTRODUCTION OF NEW FINANCIAL METRICS
Crown Castle, a provider of real estate to the wireless industry, has adopted the following financial metrics, which are metrics typically utilized by Real Estate Investment Trusts ("REITs"): funds from operations ("FFO") and AFFO. Crown Castle is adopting the definition of FFO set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.  Further, Crown Castle is adopting the same definition of AFFO as American Tower Corporation, one of Crown Castle's peers in the tower industry. Crown Castle's definition for FFO and AFFO are set forth in this release.  Crown Castle expects to report both FFO and AFFO on a per common share basis, based on diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. While Crown Castle's recurring cash flow ("RCF") metric is provided in this press release, Crown Castle expects to replace its historical RCF metric with FFO and AFFO going forward.
FFO increased 9% to $182 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $168 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. FFO per share increased 10% to $0.63 in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2010.
AFFO increased 15% to $193 million in fourth quarter 2011 compared to $167 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. AFFO per share increased 17% to $0.68 in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2010.
FFO increased $526 million from $182 million for full year 2010 to $708 million for full year 2011.
FFO per share increased $1.85 to $2.48 in full year 2011 compared to $0.63 for full year 2010. AFFO increased $106 million, or 17%, from $631 million for full year 2010 to $737 million for full year 2011. AFFO per share increased 17% to $2.58 in full year 2011 compared to $2.20 for full year 2010.
FFO and AFFO have been provided in this release for periods beginning January 1, 2007.  Further, Crown Castle has provided a supplemental file containing additional information related to the introduction of these metrics on its website at

RECENT SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS
In December 2011, Crown Castle entered into an agreement to acquire NextG Networks for $1.0 billion in cash (subject to certain adjustments). NextG, the largest provider of DAS, currently has over 7,000 nodes on-air, 1,500 nodes under construction and over 4,600 miles of fiber. The acquisition will expand Crown Castle's portfolio of DAS, providing additional wireless coverage and capacity solutions to customers beyond those areas traditionally served by towers. Following the contemplated acquisition, Crown Castle expects to be the largest independent DAS operator in the US, with approximately 10,000 nodes in operation or under construction. Eighty percent of these nodes are located in the top ten US metropolitan areas, including more than 20 university campuses and 26 venues. Based on existing and contracted networks under construction, Crown Castle expects NextG to have at closing approximately $40 million of run-rate annualized site rental gross margin, $17 million of annualized run-rate general and administrative costs, and approximately $10 million of run-rate annualized site rental gross margin under construction. The NextG general and administrative costs are largely comprised of costs associated with developing and building new sites and leasing the existing nodes.  Crown Castle expects to be able to achieve cost synergies following the acquisition while maintaining the development and operating expertise of NextG.  The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2012.
In January 2012, Crown Castle entered into an agreement to acquire from Wireless Capital Partners, LLC ("WCP") a portfolio of ground lease related assets for approximately $180 million in cash and the assumption of approximately $320 million of debt (weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.5%). The portfolio includes approximately 2,300 ground lease related assets, including over 150 related to Crown Castle towers. The assets being acquired generate annual cash flow before interest expense of approximately $42 million, with 80% generated from the big four carriers. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2012.
FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES
In January 2012, Crown Castle announced it was seeking a new $3.1 billion senior credit facility.  The new facility is expected to consist of a $1.0 billion Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility ("Revolver"), a $500 million Delayed-Draw Senior Secured Term Loan A Facility ("Term Loan A"), and a $1.6 billion Senior Secured Term Loan B Facility ("Term Loan B"). The proceeds of the loans are expected to be used in part to repay the existing revolving credit facility (under which $251 million is currently outstanding), to repay the existing term loan facility (under which $619 million is currently outstanding), and to fund the expected acquisitions of NextG and WCP assets. The balance of the proceeds will be available for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and purchases of its shares. Crown Castle expects the proposed $3.1 billion credit facility to close on January 31, 2012, resulting in a net increase to 2012 interest expense of approximately $60 million, assuming the $1.6 billion Term Loan B is drawn on January 31, 2012, the $500 million Term Loan A is drawn on April 1, 2012, and the Revolver is undrawn.  
Also, in January 2012, Crown Castle announced its intention to convert its 6.25% redeemable convertible preferred stock, which will result in the issuance of 8.3 million common shares and eliminate an annual dividend of $19 million. As of December 31, 2011, the outstanding balance of the 6.25% redeemable convertible preferred stock was $305 million.
Pro forma diluted common shares outstanding at
December 31, 2011
were 291.3 million, including the aforementioned common shares expected to be issued in connection with the conversion of Crown Castle's 6.25% redeemable convertible preferred stock. During 2011, Crown Castle spent $318 million to buy 7.7 million of its common shares and potential shares. Since January 2003, Crown Castle has spent $2.7 billion to purchase 100.3 million of its common shares and potential shares, at an average price of $26.85 per common share.
During the
fourth
quarter of 2011, Crown Castle invested approximately $83 million in capital expenditures, comprised of $33 million of land purchases, $9 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $41 million of revenue generating capital expenditures, the latter consisting of $28 million on existing sites and $13 million on the construction of new sites, primarily DAS nodes.
"We had an excellent 2011 as we grew our core business and made meaningful investments that I believe will enhance our long-term growth rates," stated Jay Brown, Chief Financial Officer of Crown Castle. "During the course of 2011, we continued to strengthen our contractual relationships, ending 2011 with more than $17 billion of site rental revenues under contract and 76% of annualized run-rate site rental gross margin on land, beneath towers, that we own or control for more than 20 years. Additionally, I am very pleased with the announcement of the proposed $3.1 billion credit facility. I believe that the new facility will give us
tremendous flexibility with approximately $1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. As has been our historical practice, we remain focused on enhancing our operating growth through investments around our core business, including investments in share purchases, tower and DAS acquisitions and land purchases, that we believe will enhance long-term AFFO per share."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Calculations
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA, recurring cash flow, funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")). Each of the amounts included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, recurring cash flow, FFO, and AFFO are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of: (1) sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP and (2) our adjustment to the income tax provision in calculations of FFO and AFFO.
Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA, recurring cash flow, FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector or those reported by REITs. FFO and AFFO presented are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have been achieved had we converted to a REIT, nor are they necessarily indicative of future financial position or operating results. Our FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to those reported in accordance with National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, including as a result of our adjustment to the income tax provision to reflect our estimate of the cash taxes had we been a REIT.
Adjusted EBITDA, recurring cash flow, FFO and AFFO are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations.
Adjusted EBITDA
. Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on retirement of long-term obligations, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense.
Recurring cash flow.
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures.
Funds from operations.
Crown Castle defines funds from operations as net income plus adjusted tax provision plus real estate deprecation, amortization and accretion.
Adjusted funds from operations.
Crown Castle defines adjusted funds from operations as funds from operations before straight-line revenue, straight-line expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of deferred financing costs, debt discounts, and interest rate swaps, other (income) and expense, gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, acquisition and integration costs, asset-write down charges and less capital improvement capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures.
Sustaining capital expenditures.
Crown Castle defines sustaining capital expenditures as either (1) corporate related capital improvements, such as information technology equipment and office equipment or (2) capital improvements to tower sites that enable our customers' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the tower.
The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.
