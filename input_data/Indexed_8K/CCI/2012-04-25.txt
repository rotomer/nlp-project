CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL
REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2012 RESULTS;
RAISES 2012 OUTLOOK
April 25, 2012 - HOUSTON, TEXAS - Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter ended
March 31, 2012
.
"We had an excellent first quarter, exceeding the high-end of our Outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA," stated Ben Moreland, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Further, we completed the acquisition of a portfolio of ground lease related assets from Wireless Capital Partners in the first quarter and closed the NextG Networks acquisition earlier this month and are making good progress integrating those assets. In the first quarter, we enjoyed robust leasing activity from wireless carriers resulting in a 25% increase compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting increased activity by customers upgrading their networks. Additionally, the contribution from network services exceeded our expectations, and site rental revenue from our Australia business grew 15% in the first quarter 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. The contribution from the aforementioned acquisitions, together with the strong organic leasing activity, allows us to increase our full year 2012 Outlook, which now suggests full year site rental revenue growth of 10% and adjusted funds from operations growth of 13% without considering any contribution from discretionary investments for the balance of the year."

FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES

"Further, I am very pleased with the performance of our business as reflected in our first quarter results and our increased 2012 Outlook.  Given the strong performance of our business in the first quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year, coupled with the aforementioned acquisitions, we have increased our 2012 Outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO."
During the
first
quarter of
2012
, Crown Castle invested approximately
$65 million
in capital expenditures, comprised of
$28 million
of land purchases,
$4 million
of sustaining capital expenditures and
$33 million
of revenue generating capital expenditures, the latter consisting of
$26 million
on existing sites and

on the construction of new sites, primarily distributed antenna system ("DAS") nodes.
Also, during the first quarter of 2012, Crown Castle purchased
0.7 million
of its common shares and potential shares using
$35.5 million
in cash at an average price of
$51.36
per share. Diluted common shares outstanding at March 31, 2012 were 291.6 million. Since January 2003, Crown Castle has spent $2.7 billion to purchase 101.0 million of its common shares and potential shares, at an average price of $27.02 per share.
Additionally, during the first quarter of 2012, Crown Castle converted its 6.25% redeemable convertible preferred stock into 8.3 million common shares, eliminating an annual dividend of $19 million. Further, during the first quarter Crown Castle used $29 million of cash to purchase $6 million of the 9%
Senior Notes and $21 million of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes, including related make-whole costs. In April 2012, Crown Castle used $27 million of cash to purchase $18 million of the 9% Senior Notes and $7 million of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes, including related make-whole costs.
ACQUISITIONS AND RELATED DEBT FINANCING
In December 2011, Crown Castle announced it had reached agreement to acquire NextG, the largest provider of outdoor DAS, for approximately $1.0 billion in cash. Further, in January 2012, Crown Castle announced it had reached agreement to acquire a portfolio of ground lease related assets from Wireless Capital Partners ("WCP assets") for approximately $180 million in cash and the assumption of approximately $320 million of debt. The WCP asset acquisition closed on January 31, 2012, and the NextG acquisition closed on April 10, 2012.
In February 2012, Crown Castle International Corp. announced that its direct wholly owned subsidiary, Crown Castle Operating Company ("CCOC"), completed a new $3.1 billion credit facility ("New Facility") consisting of a $1.0 billion Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility ("Revolver") maturing on January 31, 2017, a $500 million Senior Secured Term Loan A Facility ("Term Loan A") maturing on January 31, 2017, and a $1.6 billion Senior Secured Term Loan B Facility ("Term Loan B") maturing on January 31, 2019. The Term Loan B was fully drawn at closing, the Term Loan A was drawn on March 30, 2012, and the Revolver was undrawn at closing and remains undrawn. The current annualized cash interest expense associated with these loans is $81.5 million, or 3.9% of outstanding loan balance.
The proceeds of the term loans under the New Facility were used in part to repay CCOC's previously existing revolving credit facility (under which there was approximately $251 million outstanding), to repay CCOC's previously existing term loan facility (under which there was approximately $619 million outstanding) and to fund the cash consideration for the acquisition of WCP assets and NextG.
Interest expense increased in the first quarter 2012 by $11 million compared to the first quarter 2011, due to the increase in interest associated with the New Facility and the assumption of the debt resulting from the WCP asset acquisition.
   
OUTLOOK
    
This Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein is set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
The following Outlook table is based on current expectations and assumptions and assumes a US
dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 1.0 US dollar to 1.0 Australian dollar for second quarter 2012 and full year 2012 Outlook.
As reflected in the following table, Crown Castle has increased the midpoint of its full year 2012 Outlook, previously issued on January 25, 2012, for site rental revenue by $108 million, site rental gross margin by $78 million, Adjusted EBITDA by $88 million and AFFO by $18 million. In 2012, the acquisitions of the WCP assets and NextG, which were not included in our previous 2012 Outlook, are expected to contribute approximately $90 million of site rental revenue and $50 million to $55 million of Adjusted EBITDA.
Interest expense for full year 2012 Outlook has increased by $68 million compared to the Outlook previously issued on January 25, 2012, as a result of the New Facility, the assumption of the debt resulting from the WCP asset acquisition, and the aforementioned debt repurchases.
The Outlook for full year 2012 assumes site rental revenue growth of approximately $191 million and Adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately $154 million. Further, the Outlook does not assume any benefit from significant customer lease extensions in 2012.
The following table sets forth Crown Castle's current Outlook for the second quarter
2012
and full year
2012

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Calculations
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA, recurring cash flow, funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")). Each of the amounts included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, recurring cash flow, FFO, and AFFO are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of: (1) sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP and (2) our adjustment to the income tax provision in calculations of FFO and AFFO.
Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA, recurring cash flow, FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector or those reported by REITs. FFO and AFFO presented are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have been achieved had we converted to a REIT, nor are they necessarily indicative of future financial position or operating results. Our FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to those reported in accordance with National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, including as a result of our adjustment to the income tax provision to reflect our estimate of the cash taxes had we been a REIT.
Adjusted EBITDA, recurring cash flow, FFO and AFFO are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations.
Adjusted EBITDA
. Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on retirements of long-term obligations , net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense.
Recurring cash flow.
Crown Castle defines recurring cash flow to be Adjusted EBITDA, less interest expense and less sustaining capital expenditures.
Funds from operations.
Crown Castle defines funds from operations as net income plus adjusted tax provision plus real estate deprecation, amortization and accretion.
Adjusted funds from operations.
Crown Castle defines adjusted funds from operations as funds from operations before straight-line revenue, straight-line expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of deferred financing costs, debt discounts and interest rate swaps, other (income) and expense, gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, acquisition and integration costs, and asset-write down charges, less capital improvement capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures.
Sustaining capital expenditures.
Crown Castle defines sustaining capital expenditures as either (1) corporate related capital improvements, such as information technology equipment and office equipment or (2) capital improvements to tower sites that enable our customers' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the tower.
The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.
