CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL
REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2012 RESULTS;
RAISES 2012 OUTLOOK
July 25, 2012 - HOUSTON, TEXAS - Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter ended
June 30, 2012
.
"We had an excellent second quarter, exceeding the high-end of our Outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO," stated Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our second quarter results reflect the continued high level of network upgrade activity by US wireless carriers, higher than expected contribution from the assets acquired through our NextG Networks ("NextG") acquisition and from Wireless Capital Partners ("WCP"), and better than expected performance from network services. Further, we are making great progress integrating both NextG and the ground lease related assets acquired from WCP earlier this year. In addition, with the execution of the new agreement with T-Mobile noted in today's earnings release, we are busy assisting all four of the largest US wireless carriers in upgrading their networks to 4G, which is driving the vast majority of our revenue growth."

FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES
During the
second
quarter of
2012
, Crown Castle invested approximately
$95 million
in capital expenditures, comprised of
$29 million
of land purchases,
$7 million
of sustaining capital expenditures and
$58 million
of revenue generating capital expenditures, the latter consisting of
$30 million
on existing sites and
$28 million
on the construction of new sites, primarily distributed antenna system ("DAS") nodes.
Additionally, during the
second
quarter of 2012, Crown Castle used $51 million of cash, inclusive of related make-whole costs, to purchase $32 million of the 9% Senior Notes and $15 million of the 7.75% Senior Secured Notes.
AGREEMENT WITH T-MOBILE USA
During July 2012, Crown Castle reached an agreement with T-Mobile USA ("T-Mobile") to extend the remaining term on all 7,300 existing leases to 10 years, and granted T-Mobile rights to upgrade certain towers with radio equipment in connection with its network modernization plan. The terms of the agreement will result in Crown Castle recognizing an increase in site rental revenue beginning in the third quarter of 2012.  While the increase to site rental revenues from the T-Mobile lease amendment will be predominantly non-cash initially, the terms of the agreement will result in annual cash escalations such that cash received will equal revenues recognized in approximately 50 months. Crown Castle expects this agreement to contribute approximately $20 million, $20 million and $1 million in site rental revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, respectively, to its second half 2012 results.
"I am very pleased with the strong performance of our business during the second quarter as we grew year-over-year AFFO per share by 17%," stated Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. "In addition, during the second quarter, we made significant strides integrating our two recent acquisitions.  Based on the first few months of operations, we believe these acquisitions will deliver higher than previously expected contributions to site rental revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO for 2012.  Further, we have been
able to achieve cost synergies associated with these acquisitions more quickly than we previously anticipated.  The strong second quarter results, together with our expectations for the second half of the year, allow us to increase our 2012 year-over-year Outlook for site rental revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth to 13% and 17%, respectively."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Calculations
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA, funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")). Each of the amounts included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, and AFFO are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of: (1) sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP and (2) our adjustment to the income tax provision in calculations of FFO and AFFO.
Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector or those reported by REITs. FFO and AFFO presented are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have been achieved had we converted to a REIT, nor are they necessarily indicative of future financial position or operating results. Our FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to those reported in accordance with National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, including as a result of our adjustment to the income tax provision to reflect our estimate of the cash taxes had we been a REIT.
Adjusted EBITDA, recurring cash flow, FFO and AFFO are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations.
Adjusted EBITDA
. Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on retirements of long-term obligations , net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense.
Funds from operations.
Crown Castle defines funds from operations as net income plus adjusted tax provision plus real estate deprecation, amortization and accretion.
Adjusted funds from operations.
Crown Castle defines adjusted funds from operations as funds from operations before straight-line revenue, straight-line expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of deferred financing costs, debt discounts and interest rate swaps, other (income) and expense, gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, acquisition and integration costs, and asset-write down charges, less capital improvement capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures.
Sustaining capital expenditures.
Crown Castle defines sustaining capital expenditures as either (1) corporate related capital improvements, such as information technology equipment and office equipment or (2) capital improvements to tower sites that enable our customers' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the tower.
The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.
