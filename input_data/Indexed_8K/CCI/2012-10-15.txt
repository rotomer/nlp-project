ITEM 1.01  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
Indenture
On October 15, 2012, Crown Castle International Corp. (Company) closed its previously announced offering of $1.65 billion principal amount of the Companys 5.25% Senior Notes due 2023 (Notes) to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), and outside of the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.  The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of October 15, 2012 (Indenture), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (Trustee).  The Company is filing the Indenture as Exhibit 4.1 to this report.
The Notes are general obligations of the Company, which rank equally with all existing and future senior debt of the Company.  The Notes will be effectively subordinated to all liabilities (including trade payables) of each subsidiary of the Company.  The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.25% per annum, payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2013, to persons who are registered holders of the Notes on the immediately preceding January 1 and July 1, respectively.
The Indenture limits the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to make restricted payments, incur indebtedness, issue preferred stock, incur liens, create dividend restrictions and other payment restrictions that affect the Companys subsidiaries, sell assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, issue guarantees of indebtedness and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain qualifications set forth in the Indenture.
In the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of such repurchase.
The Notes will mature on January 15, 2023.  However, the Company, at its option, may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time by paying 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus a make-whole premium.  In addition, before January 15, 2016, and subject to certain conditions, the Company may, at its option, redeem up to 35% of the Notes at the redemption price set forth in the Indenture with the proceeds of certain equity offerings by the Company.
The above description of the Indenture does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties rights and obligations under the Indenture and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Indenture, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
Registration Rights Agreement
On October 15, 2012, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement relating to the Notes, by and among the Company, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representatives of the initial purchasers of the Notes (Registration Rights Agreement).  The Registration Rights Agreement requires the Company to use its commercially reasonable efforts to, among other things: (i) file a registration statement with respect to the Notes to be used in connection with the exchange of the Notes for publicly registered notes with substantially identical terms in all material respects (except for the transfer restrictions relating to the Notes); (ii) cause the applicable registration statement to become effective under the Securities Act; and (iii) upon the effectiveness of the applicable registration statement, commence an exchange offer.  In addition, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to file a shelf registration statement to cover resales of the Notes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the exchange offer has not been completed on or prior to the day that is 365 days after the date of the original issuance of the Notes or in certain other circumstances set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will be required to pay additional interest as set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement.
The above description of the Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be a complete statement of the parties rights and obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

(a)           Unless the Exchange Offer shall not be permissible under applicable law or Commission policy, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) file with the Commission a Registration Statement under the Securities Act relating to the Exchange Securities and the Exchange Offer and cause such Registration Statement to become effective, (ii) in connection with the foregoing, file (A) all pre-effective amendments to such Registration Statement as may be necessary in order to cause such Registration Statement to become effective, (B) if applicable, a post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430A under the Securities Act and (C) subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6(c)(xi),cause all necessary filings in connection with the registration and qualification of the Exchange Securities to be made under the state securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as are necessary to permit Consummation of the Exchange Offer, and (iii) upon the effectiveness of such Registration Statement, commence the Exchange Offer.  The Exchange Offer shall be on the appropriate form permitting registration of the Exchange Securities to be offered in exchange for the Transfer Restricted Securities and to permit resales of Initial Securities held by Broker-Dealers as contemplated by Section 3(c) hereof.
(b)           The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to be effective continuously and shall keep the Exchange Offer open for a period of not less than the minimum period required under applicable federal and state securities laws to Consummate the Exchange Offer; , that in no event shall such period be less than 20 Business Days after the date notice of the Exchange Offer is mailed to the Holders.  The Company shall cause the Exchange Offer to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws.

The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Offer to be Consummated on the earliest practicable date after the Exchange Offer Registration Statement has become effective, but in no event later than 365 days after the Closing Date (or if such 365 day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day).

th
(c)           The Company shall indicate in a Plan of Distribution section contained in the Prospectus forming a part of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement that any Broker-Dealer who holds Initial Securities that are Transfer Restricted Securities and that were acquired for its own account as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities (other than Transfer Restricted Securities acquired directly from the Company) may exchange such Initial Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer; however, such Broker-Dealer may be deemed to be an underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and must, therefore, deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resales of the Exchange Securities received by such Broker-Dealer in the Exchange Offer, which prospectus delivery requirement may be satisfied by the delivery by such Broker-Dealer of the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement.  Such Plan of Distribution section shall also contain all other information with respect to such resales by Broker-Dealers that the Commission may require in order to permit such resales pursuant thereto, but such Plan of Distribution shall not name any such Broker-Dealer or disclose the amount of Initial Securities held by any such Broker-Dealer except to the extent required by the Commission.

(x)           cause to be filed a shelf registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, which may be an amendment to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (in either event, the Shelf Registration Statement) on or prior to the 30th day after the date on which the Company receives notice from a Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities as contemplated above; in no event shall the Company be required to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be filed earlier than the earlier of (a) the 300th day following the Closing Date (or if such 300th day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day) and (b) the 60th day following the Consummation of the Exchange Offer (or if such 60th day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day); (such earliest date being the Shelf Filing Deadline), which Shelf Registration Statement shall provide for resales of all Transfer Restricted Securities the Holders of which shall have provided the information required pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof; and
provided
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(y)           use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission on or before the 65th day after receipt of the written requests required pursuant to Section 4(a) (or if such 65th day is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day).
The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective to the extent necessary to ensure that it is available for resales of Initial Securities by the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities entitled to the benefit of this Section 4(a), and to ensure that it conforms with the requirements of this Agreement, the Securities Act and the policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as announced from time to time until the earlier of (a) one year from the Closing Date or (b) the date on which all the Initial Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement (such period, the Shelf Registration Period).
(b)           No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities may include any of its Transfer Restricted Securities in any Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such Holder furnishes to the Company in writing, within 10 Business Days after receipt of a request therefor, such information as the Company may reasonably request for use in connection with any Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus included therein.  Each Holder as to which any Shelf Registration Statement is being effected agrees to furnish promptly to the Company all information required to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company by such Holder not materially misleading.
Provision by Holders of Certain Information in Connection with the Shelf Registration Statement.  
SECTION 5.          (a)  If (i) the Exchange Offer has not been Consummated on or prior to the day that is 365 days after the Closing Date (the Effectiveness Target Date), (ii) if applicable, a Shelf Registration Statement covering resales of the Transfer Restricted Securities has not been filed or declared effective by the dates set out in Section 4 , in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement required to be filed or declared effective pursuant to Section 4(a)(x)(b), such date shall be the day that is 365 days after the Closing Date, or (iii) if applicable, after the Shelf Registration Statement is filed and declared effective, such Shelf Registration Statement thereafter ceases to be effective or fails to be usable for its intended purpose (except as permitted in Section 5(b)) in connection with resales of Transfer Restricted Securities during the periods specified herein because either (1) any event occurs as a result of which the related prospectus forming part of such Shelf Registration Statement would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, (2) it shall be necessary to amend such Shelf Registration Statement or supplement the related prospectus, to comply with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, or (3) the Shelf Registration Statement has expired before a replacement Shelf Registration Statement has become effective at any time during the Shelf Registration Period (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (iii), a Registration Default), the Company hereby agrees that the interest rate borne by the Transfer Restricted Securities shall be increased by 0.25% per annum during the 90-day period immediately following the occurrence of such Registration Default and shall increase by 0.25% per annum at the end of each subsequent 90-day period in which the Registration Default is continuing, but in no event shall such increase exceed 1.00% per annum (such increased interest, the Additional Interest).  Following the cure of all Registration Defaults relating to any particular Transfer Restricted Securities, the interest rate borne by the relevant Transfer Restricted Securities will be reduced to the original interest rate borne by such Transfer Restricted Securities; that, if after any such reduction in interest rate, a different Registration Default occurs, the interest rate borne by the relevant Transfer Restricted Securities shall again be increased pursuant to the foregoing provisions.
Additional Interest.  
provided that
provided, however,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All obligations of the Company set forth in the preceding paragraph that are outstanding with respect to any Transfer Restricted Security at the time such security ceases to be a Transfer Restricted Security shall survive until such time as all such obligations with respect to such security shall have been satisfied in full.
(b) A Registration Default referred to in Section 5(a)(iii) hereof shall be deemed not
to have occurred and be continuing in relation to a Shelf Registration Statement or the related
prospectus if (i) such Registration Default has occurred solely as a result of (x) the filing of a
post-effective amendment to such Shelf Registration Statement to incorporate annual audited
financial information with respect to the Company where such post-effective amendment is not
yet effective and needs to be declared effective to permit Holders to use the related prospectus or
(y) other material events with respect to the Company that would need to be described in such
Shelf Registration Statement or the related prospectus and (ii) in the case of clause (y), the
Company is proceeding promptly and in good faith to amend or supplement such Shelf
Registration Statement and related prospectus to describe such events; provided, however, that in
any case if such Registration Default occurs for a continuous period in excess of 30 days (such
period, the Suspension Period), Additional Interest shall be payable in accordance with
Section 5(a) from the 61st day after such Registration Default occurs until such Registration Default is cured.

If at any time the Commission shall issue any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or any state securities commission or other regulatory authority shall issue an order suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities under state securities or blue sky laws, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such order at the earliest possible time;

Without limiting the foregoing, such counsel may state further that such counsel assumes no responsibility for, and has not independently verified, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the financial statements, notes and schedules and other financial data included in any Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement or the related Prospectus and such other customary matters; and

If so directed by the Company, each Holder will deliver to the Company (at the Companys expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holders possession, of the Prospectus covering such Transfer Restricted Securities that was current at the time of receipt of such notice.  In the event the Company shall give any such notice, the time period regarding the effectiveness of such Registration Statement set forth in Section 3 or 4 hereof, as applicable, shall be extended by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice pursuant to Section 6(c)(iii)(D) hereof to and including the date when each selling Holder covered by such Registration Statement shall have received the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(c)(xiv) hereof or shall have received the Advice; that no such extension if in excess of a Suspension Period shall be taken into account in determining whether Additional Interest is due pursuant to Section 5 hereof or the amount of such Additional Interest, it being agreed that the Companys option to suspend use of a Registration Statement pursuant to this paragraph if in excess of a Suspension Period shall be treated as a Registration Default for purposes of Section 5 hereof.
provided, however,
SECTION 7.        . All expenses incident to the Companys performance of or compliance with this Agreement will be borne by the Company, regardless of whether a Registration Statement becomes effective, including, without limitation: (i) all filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel to the Initial Purchasers and Holders incurred in connection with the review and qualification of the offering of the Securities by FINRA;  (ii) all fees and expenses of compliance with federal securities and state securities or blue sky laws to the extent required hereunder; (iii) all expenses of printing (including printing certificates for the Exchange Securities to be issued in the Exchange Offer and printing of Prospectuses); (iv) all fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company; (v) all expenses in connection with any offer and sale of the Exchange Securities outside of the United States, including filing fees and the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel for the Initial Purchasers and the Holders, taken together, in connection with offers and sales outside of the United States; (vi) all fees and disbursements of independent certified public accountants of the Company in connection with the transactions described in this Agreement (including the expenses of any special audit and comfort letters required by  such performance); and (vii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of the obligations of the Company hereunder for which provision is not otherwise made in this Section. It is understood, however, that except as provided in this Section 7 and Section 8, the Initial Purchasers, Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities and Managing Underwriters, if any, will pay all of their costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of their counsel, transfer taxes payable on resale of any of the Securities by them and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.

SECTION 8.        .
Indemnification
(a)           The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless (i) each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, (ii) each Person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities and (iii) each affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities (the Persons referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), collectively, the Indemnified Holders) from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in an Exchange Offer Registration Statement, a Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus contained therein (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any of the Indemnified Holders furnished to the Company by any of the Indemnified Holders expressly for use therein.
In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the indemnified party) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the indemnifying party) in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.  It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to one local counsel in each jurisdiction) for all Indemnified Holders and (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to one local counsel in each jurisdiction) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign an Exchange Offer Registration Statement or a Shelf Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  In the case of any such separate firm for the Indemnified Holders, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Representatives.  In the case of any such separate firm for the Company, and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such firm shall be designated in writing by the Company.  The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of an indemnified party.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b)           Each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its directors, officers who sign an Exchange Offer Registration Statement or a Shelf Registration Statement, and any Person controlling (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Company, and the respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents of each such Person, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in an Exchange Offer Registration Statement, a Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus contained therein (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only with reference to information relating to such Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities furnished to the Company in writing expressly for use in an Exchange Offer Registration Statement, Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus contained therein (or any amendment or supplement thereto).
(c)           To the extent the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) hereof or is insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Holders, on the other hand, from the Exchange Offer or (ii) if the allocation provided by Section 8(c)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Holders, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Indemnified Holder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Indemnified Holders and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.  The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in the second paragraph of Section 8(a) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company and each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(c) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Indemnified Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.  The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Indemnified Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discount received by such Holder with respect to the Initial Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Holders obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8(c) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of Initial Securities held by each of the Holders hereunder and not joint.  The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
(d)           The indemnification provisions contained in this Section 8 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any termination of this agreement, any investigation made by or on behalf of an Indemnified Holder or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and completion of the Exchange Offer.
SECTION 9.        
Rule 144A
The Company hereby agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted Securities remain outstanding, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to make available to any Holder or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer Restricted Securities from such Holder or beneficial owner, the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act in order to permit resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act.
.  
SECTION 10.      
Participation in Underwritten Registrations
No Holder may participate in any Underwritten Registration hereunder unless such Holder (a) agrees to sell such Holders Transfer Restricted Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all reasonable questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements, lock-up letters and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SECTION 11.      
Selection of Underwriters
The Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement who desire to do so may sell such Transfer Restricted Securities in an Underwritten Offering.  In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment banker(s) and managing underwriter(s) that will administer such offering (the Managing Underwriters) will be selected by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Transfer Restricted Securities included in such offering; , that such Managing Underwriters must be reasonably satisfactory to the Company.
.  
provided, however
SECTION 12.      . 
Miscellaneous
 
(a
)           The Company hereby agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and hereby agree to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.
Remedies.  
(b)           The Company will not on or after the date of this Agreement enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.  The Company has not previously entered into any agreement granting any registration rights with respect to the Initial Securities to any Person.  The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the Companys securities under any agreement in effect on the date hereof.
No Inconsistent Agreements.
(c)           The provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to or departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless the Company has (i) in the case of Section 5 hereof and this Section 12(c), obtained the written consent of Holders of all outstanding Transfer Restricted Securities and (ii) in the case of all other provisions hereof, obtained the written consent of Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities (excluding any Transfer Restricted Securities held by the Company or its affiliates).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and that does not affect directly or indirectly the rights of other Holders whose securities are not being tendered pursuant to such Exchange Offer may be given by the Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities being tendered or registered; that, with respect to any matter that directly and adversely affects the rights of any Initial Purchaser hereunder, the Company shall obtain the written consent of each such Initial Purchaser with respect to which such amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver, consent or departure is to be effective.
