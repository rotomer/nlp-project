CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL
REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2012 RESULTS;
RAISES 2012 OUTLOOK AND PROVIDES 2013 OUTLOOK
October 24, 2012 - HOUSTON, TEXAS - Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE:CCI) today reported results for the quarter ended
September 30, 2012
.
"We had an excellent third quarter, exceeding the high-end of our Outlook for site rental revenue, site rental gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO," stated Ben Moreland, Crown Castle's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our third quarter results reflect an unprecedented level of activity for Crown Castle as all four major carriers in the US are actively engaged in upgrading their networks for LTE. This activity is translating into increased levels of new site rental revenue and record levels of service revenue and margin. Additionally, pending closing of the transaction to acquire exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 7,200 T-Mobile towers this quarter, we look forward to integrating those sites and marketing them as part of our US portfolio. As the largest wireless infrastructure provider in the US, we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on US wireless market growth with cost-effective shared solutions in towers and small cells enabling wireless carriers to meet the ever increasing demands of the consumer."

T-MOBILE USA TOWER TRANSACTION
In September 2012, Crown Castle entered into a definitive agreement with T-Mobile USA to acquire the exclusive right to lease and operate approximately 7,200 T-Mobile towers in the US for a weighted average term of approximately 28 years for cash consideration of $2.4 billion (subject to certain adjustments). In addition, Crown Castle will have the option, primarily between 2025 and 2048, to purchase such towers at the end of the respective lease terms for aggregate option payments of approximately $2.4 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2012.
FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES
"We had a great third quarter, as evidenced by our 20% year-over-year growth in AFFO per share, which I believe is the best measure of value creation in our business and industry," stated Jay Brown, Crown Castle's Chief Financial Officer. "The strong third quarter results, together with our expectations for the remainder of the year, allow us to increase our 2012 year-over-year Outlook for site rental revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.  Further, as our initial 2013 Outlook reflects, we expect AFFO to grow 14% from 2012, before the accretive impact of the T-Mobile transaction, net of related financing costs, and the investment of our cash flow.   This expected growth in AFFO is the result of significant increases in contracted cash payments in 2013 under previously disclosed lease agreements with some of our US customers, coupled with expected new 2013 leasing activity.  Finally, I am very pleased with our ability to have accessed the capital markets and raised long-term financing for our T-Mobile tower transaction at an attractive rate."
In October 2012, Crown Castle closed on a $1.65 billion senior notes offering, with an interest rate of 5.25% per annum, the proceeds of which are expected to fund a portion of the T-Mobile tower transaction consideration. The $1.65 billion of notes mature in 2023. Crown Castle expects to fund the balance of the T-Mobile transaction consideration with cash-on-hand and funds from its revolving credit facility.
During the
third
quarter of
2012
, Crown Castle invested approximately
$124 million
in capital expenditures, comprised of
$30 million
of land purchases,
$7 million
of sustaining capital expenditures and
$86 million
of revenue generating capital expenditures, the latter consisting of
$37 million
on existing sites and
$49 million
on the construction of new sites, primarily distributed antenna system ("DAS") nodes.
OUTLOOK
This Outlook section contains forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Information regarding potential risks which could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements herein is set forth below and in Crown Castle's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
The following Outlook table is based on current expectations and assumptions and assumes a US dollar to Australian dollar exchange rate of 1.0 US dollar to 1.0 Australian dollar.
As reflected in the following table, Crown Castle has increased the midpoint of its full year 2012 Outlook (previously issued on July 25, 2012) for site rental revenue by $7 million, site rental gross margin by $10 million, Adjusted EBITDA by $17 million, and AFFO by $2 million.
The Outlook excludes any benefit from the T-Mobile tower transaction but includes cash interest expense of approximately $18 million and $86 million in the fourth quarter 2012 and full year 2013, respectively, associated with the $1.65 billion of senior notes, the proceeds of which are expected to fund, in part, the T-Mobile tower transaction. Crown Castle expects to fund the balance of the consideration to be paid to T-Mobile through borrowings under its revolving credit facility, which has a cost of LIBOR plus 250 basis points. Crown Castle estimates the T-Mobile towers will produce approximately $125 million to $130 million in AFFO before financing costs in 2013. As a result, Crown Castle expects the T-Mobile tower transaction, net of related debt financing costs, to be accretive to AFFO in 2013.
Crown Castle expects 2013 AFFO to increase approximately $120 million, or 14%, compared to 2012, excluding the 2013 interest expense associated with the $1.65 billion of senior notes raised in advance of the expected T-Mobile tower transaction. The 2013 Outlook for site rental revenue growth of $100 million, or 5%, assumes that the vast majority of the 2013 leasing activity from the four largest carriers continues to be amendment activity related to 4G deployments. As a result of Crown Castle's previously disclosed contractual commitments for amendment activity with these four carriers, approximately half of the additional revenue benefit of the forecasted 2013 amendment activity is already included in the run-rate of site rental revenue as of the third quarter of 2012. Further, the 2013 Outlook assumes annual site rental revenue growth of approximately 40% and 9% from small cells and Australia, respectively. In addition, the 2013 Outlook
assumes 2% growth from escalators on the existing run-rate of site rental revenues, offset by tenant terminations of approximately 1% of total site rental revenues, consistent with historical averages.
The following table sets forth Crown Castle's current Outlook for fourth quarter
2012
, full year
2012
and full year 2013:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Calculations
This press release includes presentations of Adjusted EBITDA, funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as alternative measures of operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")). Each of the amounts included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, and AFFO are computed in accordance with GAAP, with the exception of: (1) sustaining capital expenditures, which is not defined under GAAP and (2) our adjustment to the income tax provision in calculations of FFO and AFFO.
Our measures of Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including other companies in the tower sector or those reported by REITs. FFO and AFFO presented are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have been achieved had we converted to a REIT, nor are they necessarily indicative of future financial position or operating results. Our FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to those reported in accordance with National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, including as a result of our adjustment to the income tax provision to reflect our estimate of the cash taxes had we been a REIT.
Adjusted EBITDA, recurring cash flow, FFO and AFFO are presented as additional information because management believes these measures are useful indicators of the financial performance of our core businesses. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of current financial performance used in our debt covenant calculations.
Adjusted EBITDA
. Crown Castle defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on retirements of long-term obligations , net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense.
Funds from operations.
Crown Castle defines funds from operations as net income plus adjusted tax provision plus real estate deprecation, amortization and accretion.
Adjusted funds from operations.
Crown Castle defines adjusted funds from operations as funds from operations before straight-line revenue, straight-line expense, stock-based compensation expense, non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of deferred financing costs, debt discounts and interest rate swaps, other (income) and expense, gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, acquisition and integration costs, and asset-write down charges, less capital improvement capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures.
Sustaining capital expenditures.
Crown Castle defines sustaining capital expenditures as either (1) corporate related capital improvements, such as information technology equipment and office equipment or (2) capital improvements to tower sites that enable our customers' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the tower.
The tables set forth below reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures. The components in these tables may not sum to the total due to rounding.
