ITEM 2.01  COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS
On November 30, 2012, Crown Castle International Corp., a Delaware corporation (Crown Castle), through certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries, completed its acquisition of the exclusive right to lease, operate or otherwise acquire approximately 7,100 wireless communications sites (the Sites) from T-Mobile USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, AG (T-Mobile), and certain T-Mobile subsidiaries for approximately $2.486 billion in cash (subject to certain post-closing adjustments).  Crown Castle completed the acquisition pursuant to the Master Agreement dated as of September 28, 2012, among Crown Castle, certain Crown Castle subsidiaries, T-Mobile and certain T-Mobile subsidiaries, filed as Exhibit 10.1 to Crown Castles Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 28, 2012 and filed on October 2, 2012, and the related Master Prepaid Lease, Management Agreement and MPL Site Master Lease Agreement and Sale Site Master Lease Agreement (together with the MPL Site Master Lease Agreement, the Master Lease Agreements) entered into by certain Crown Castle subsidiaries and T-Mobile or certain T-Mobile subsidiaries, as applicable, on November 30, 2012, in each case substantially in the forms described in, and filed as Exhibits 10.2 through 10.5 to, Crown Castles Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 28, 2012 and filed on October 2, 2012.  The executed Master Prepaid Lease, Management Agreement and Master Lease Agreements will be filed as exhibits to Crown Castles Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.
Of the approximately 7,100 Sites included in the transaction as of November 30, 2012, Crown Castle is leasing or subleasing 6,209 Sites pursuant to the Master Prepaid Lease from certain T-Mobile subsidiaries and has purchased 896 Sites from T-Mobile and certain T-Mobile subsidiaries, including 473 Sites located primarily in California and Nevada that are subject to certain of the terms of the Lease and Sublease dated as of December 14, 2000, among SBC Tower Holdings LLC, Southern Towers, Inc., SBC Wireless, LLC and SpectraSite Holdings, Inc. (filed as Exhibit 10.2 to the SpectraSite Holdings, Inc. Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (File No. 000-27217) filed on May 11, 2001), and certain related agreements. The number of Sites included in the transaction is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, and certain of the Sites are subject to management arrangements until all requisite authorizations for their lease, sublease or sale, as applicable, have been obtained.
The consideration paid by Crown Castle for the Sites was funded with cash on hand, with proceeds from Crown Castles private offering of $1,650,000,000 5.25% Senior Notes due 2023, which were issued on October 15, 2012, and with borrowings under Crown Castles revolving credit facility.
Upon the closing of the transaction, Crown Castle, through certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries, agreed to lease, sublease or otherwise make available collocation space at each Site to certain T-Mobile collocators pursuant to the Master Lease Agreements for a period of ten years, subject to automatic extension (unless terminated by the applicable T-Mobile collocators) for eight additional five-year renewal terms, for initial collocation rent of $1,905 per month for each Site (subject to adjustments).
