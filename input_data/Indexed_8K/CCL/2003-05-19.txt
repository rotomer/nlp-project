Cruises that begin in one accounting period and end in another have their pcds apportioned accordingly; the financial results are treated similarly. Figures include all ocean going vessels and riverboats operated by Carnival plc and its subsidiaries. Occupancy is calculated by dividing the achieved passenger cruise days by the offered passenger cruise days. Since the former includes upper berths whereas the latter includes only lower berths, the occupancy can exceed 100%. Commentary on first quarter results Passenger cruise days in the first quarter of 2003 were 16.5% higher than in the first quarter of 2002. In North America, Princess' passenger cruise days increased by 1.1% with the introduction of Coral Princess and Tahitian Princess offsetting the effects of transferring Crown Princess to A'ROSA in the second quarter of last year and Ocean Princess to P&O Cruises during the fourth quarter. For Europe and Australia, passenger cruise days increased by 50%, with growth in each of Germany, the UK and Australia. In Germany, AIDAvita and A'ROSA Blu (formerly Crown Princess) sailed throughout the first quarter, having been introduced during last year. In the UK, the P&O Cruises brand grew with the replacement of Victoria with the larger Oceana (formerly Ocean Princess) during the fourth quarter of 2002. In Australia, the new premium product on Pacific Princess operated for its first full quarter. For the fleet as a whole, occupancy for the quarter was 95.6%, against 98.8% in the first quarter of 2002, reflecting significantly lower occupancy levels in Germany. Gross revenues for the quarter increased by 24.8% to $639 million, reflecting the increase in passenger cruise days, higher overall gross revenues per passenger cruise day and favorable exchange rate movements. Princess' gross revenues per passenger cruise day recovered well from the first quarter of 2002 when they were impacted by the aftermath of the events of September 11, 2001. Direct operating costs increased by 29.2%, reflecting the increase in capacity, exchange rate movements, and higher fuel costs. Included within selling and administrative expenses is $6.2 million of costs related to the DLC transaction with Carnival Corporation. Excluding these transaction costs, selling and administrative expenses increased by 12.4%, reflecting the increase in capacity and exchange rate movements, offset by economies of scale, which reduced unit costs. Operating profit for the first quarter, before transaction costs, was $46.2 million, compared with $42.2 million in the first quarter of 2002, an increase of 9.5%. Net interest costs were $22.3 million, up from $16.1 million, due to the higher borrowings after the deliveries of Coral Princess at the start of the quarter and of AIDAvita during the second quarter of 2002. Profit before tax and transaction costs was $23.9 million, compared with $27.1 million in the first quarter of 2002, a decrease of 11.8%. The tax charge was $0.4 million. After deducting tax and transaction costs, the profit recorded for the quarter was $17.3 million. Earnings per share/ADS for the quarter were $0.025/$0.10, down from $0.037/$0.15, a reduction of 32.4%. Excluding the transaction costs which represented $0.009/$0.036 per share/ADS, earnings per share/ADS for the quarter were $0.034/$0.14, down from $0.037/$0.15, a reduction of 8.1%. Outlook As part of the larger Carnival Corporation & plc group, the combined companies are expected to provide a trading update along with the preliminary release of their consolidated results of operations for the three and six months ended May 31, 2003 on or about June 19, 2003. The consolidated results of Carnival Corporation & plc for the three and six months ended May 31, 2003, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, will include six months of Carnival Corporation's results and the results of Carnival plc from April 17, 2003, the date the DLC transaction was completed, to May 31, 2003.
