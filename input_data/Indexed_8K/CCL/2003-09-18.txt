The pro forma consolidated statements of operations gives pro forma effect to the dual listed company ("DLC") transaction between Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc, which was completed on April 17, 2003. This pro forma data is being furnished to update the previous pro forma information furnished to the SEC on the Carnival Corporation & plc joint Current Report on Form 8-K, dated June 25, 2003, primarily as a result of changes in the Carnival Corporation & plc statement of operations reporting format and to conform this information to the reclassifications made in the August 31, 2003 and 2002 Carnival Corporation & plc statements of operations. All the information contained in this Item 12 is being furnished solely for informational purposes and Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc do not intend for any of this information to be incorporated by reference into filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. CAUTIONARY NOTE CONCERNING FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS Some of the statements contained in this joint Current Report on Form 8-K are "forward-looking statements" that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions with respect to Carnival Corporation & plc, including some statements concerning future results, plans, outlook, goals and other events which have not yet occurred. You can find many, but not all, of these statements by looking for words like "will," "may," "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "forecast," "future," "intends," "plans," and "estimates" and for similar expressions. Because forward-looking statements, including those which may impact the forecasting of earnings per share, net revenue yields, booking levels, pricing, occupancy, operating, financing and tax costs, costs per available lower berth day, estimates of ship depreciable lives and residual values or business prospects, involve risks and uncertainties, there are many factors that could cause Carnival Corporation & plc's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied in this joint Current Report on Form 8-K. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: achievement of expected benefits from the DLC transaction; risks associated with the DLC structure; risks associated with the uncertainty of the tax status of the DLC structure; general economic and business conditions, which may impact levels of disposable income of consumers and the net revenue yields for cruise brands of Carnival Corporation & plc; conditions in the cruise and land-based vacation industries, including competition from other cruise ship operators and providers of other vacation alternatives and increases in capacity offered by cruise ship and land-based vacation alternatives; the impact of operating internationally; the international political and economic climate, armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, availability of air service and other world events and adverse publicity and their impact on the demand for cruises; accidents and other incidents at sea affecting the health, safety, security and vacation satisfaction of passengers; the ability of Carnival Corporation & plc to implement its shipbuilding programs and brand strategies and to continue to expand its businesses worldwide; the ability of Carnival Corporation & plc to attract and retain shipboard crew and maintain good relations with employee unions; the ability to obtain financing on terms that are favorable or consistent with Carnival Corporation & plc's expectations; the impact of changes in operating and financing costs, including changes in foreign currency and interest rates and fuel, food, insurance and security costs; changes in the tax, environmental, health, safety, security and other regulatory regimes under which
Carnival Corporation & plc operates; continued availability of attractive port destinations; the ability to successfully implement cost improvement plans and to integrate business acquisitions; continuing financial viability of Carnival Corporation & plc's travel agent distribution system; weather patterns or natural disasters; and the ability of a small group of shareholders effectively to control the outcome of shareholder voting. Forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. Subject to any continuing obligations under applicable law or any relevant listing rules, Carnival Corporation & plc expressly disclaims any obligation to disseminate, after the date of this announcement, any updates or revisions to any such forward-looking statements to reflect any change in expectations or events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements are based.
- -------------------------PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION------------------------
(1) The pro forma information gives pro forma effect to the DLC transaction between Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc, which was completed on April 17, 2003. Management has prepared the pro forma information based upon the companies' historical financial information and, accordingly, the above information should be read in conjunction with the companies' historical financial statements, as well as pro forma information included in the companies' joint Current Report on Form 8-K, dated May 29, 2003. The DLC transaction has been accounted for as an acquisition of Carnival plc by Carnival Corporation, using the purchase method of accounting. The Carnival plc accounting policies have been conformed to Carnival Corporation's policies. Carnival plc's reporting period has been changed to the Carnival Corporation reporting period and the information presented above covers the same periods of time for both companies. Carnival Corporation & plc are having an independent appraisal performed of all of Carnival plc's cruise ships and intangible assets. Accordingly, we believe it is possible that the fair value of some of Carnival plc's cruise ships could be less than their carrying value, thus reducing pro forma depreciation expense. In addition, amortizable intangibles which have not been valued and amortized in the above pro forma information, could also eventually be recorded and amortized, based primarily upon the appraisals. The above pro forma information has been prepared as if the DLC transaction had occurred on December 1, 2001 and has not been adjusted to reflect any net transaction benefits. In addition, the pro forma information does not purport to represent what the results of operations actually could have been if the DLC transaction had occurred on December 1, 2001 or what those results will be for any future periods. (2) Carnival plc's costs related to its terminated Royal Caribbean transaction and the completion of the DLC transaction with Carnival Corporation, which were expensed by Carnival plc prior to April 17, 2003. The amount of these nonrecurring expenses was approximately $20.1 million, $4.6 million, $24.5 million, $7.4 million, $10.9 million and $79.4 million in the three months ended February 28, 2003 and 2002, May 31, 2003 and 2002, August 31, 2002 and November 30, 2002, respectively. (3) Carnival plc has or is expected to receive insurance company and/or shipyard payments related to the Diamond Princess fire and the Island Princess delayed delivery. The present value of these payments, which approximate $99 million, has been recorded on the balance sheet of Carnival Corporation & plc as a Carnival plc fair value acquisition adjustment. Accordingly, the income originally expected to be recognized by Carnival plc of $6.8 million, $40.1 million, $30.6 million, $18.2 million and $3.2 million in the three months ended May 31, 2003, August 31, 2003, November 30, 2003, February 28, 2004 and May 31, 2004, respectively, will not be recognized in Carnival Corporation & plc's earnings, as it would have been by Carnival plc on a standalone basis, but will be accounted for as a collection of this receivable by the combined entity. - -----------------------END PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION----------------------
