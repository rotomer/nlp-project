During the term of the Consulting Agreement, Mr. Lanterman will provide such consulting services and other assistance as may be required by HAL's President on strategic, financial and historical analyses and other various services that are specified by HAL's President, up to a maximum of 1,000 hours annually. The initial term of the Consulting Agreement will be from January 1, 2005 through November 30, 2005 and renews automatically for one additional year unless earlier terminated by either party, but in no event will the consulting agreement be extended beyond November 30, 2006. The Consulting Agreement provides that Mr. Lanterman will receive annual compensation of $788,000, payable in monthly installments. He will not participate in any incentive compensation plans offered by HAL or any affiliate of HAL but will be eligible for medical and dental insurance and certain other benefits. The Consulting Agreement contains confidentiality and indemnification provisions and may be terminated by HAL for good cause or upon the death or disability of Mr. Lanterman. HAL has also agreed to indemnify Mr. Lanterman from any losses arising from his provision of the consulting services subject to the Consulting Agreement, subject to customary exceptions. At the end of the term of the Consulting Agreement, no further severance or other payments shall be provided to Mr. Lanterman except as set forth in the Retirement and Consulting Agreement between Mr. Lanterman and HAL, dated November 28, 2003, which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Carnival Corporation & plc for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2003.
