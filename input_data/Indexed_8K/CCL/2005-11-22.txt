ITEM 5.02(B). DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS. John P. McNulty, a valued and respected member of Carnival Corporation & plc's boards of directors, passed away suddenly on November 16, 2005, in Naples, Fla. Mr. McNulty joined Carnival Corporation & plc's boards of directors in June 2003 and also served as a member of the company's compensation committee. After earning his MBA from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, Mr. McNulty embarked on a distinguished 22-year career at Goldman Sachs, eventually heading up the firm's investment management division and significantly expanding the company's global investment management business. He retired from Goldman Sachs in 2001 but continued to serve as senior director of the firm. "All of us are greatly saddened by John's death and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family. He was a valued member of our boards of directors and his experience, wisdom and friendship will be missed by everyone in the Carnival organization," said Micky Arison, chairman and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. A scholarship has been established in his name and those interested in making memorial contributions may forward them to: The John P.
