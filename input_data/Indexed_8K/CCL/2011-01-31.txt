On January 28, 2011, the Compensation Committees of the Boards of Directors of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc ("Carnival Corporation & plc") approved awards of performance-based restricted stock units ("Performance RSUs") to certain executive officers and key executives pursuant to the Carnival Corporation 2002 Stock Plan (or, if applicable, the Carnival plc 2005 Employee Share Plan), and a form of RSU award agreement, including grants of the following target amounts of Performance RSUs to our named executive officers: 19,620 Performance RSUs to Micky Arison, Chairman of the Boards of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; 4,841 Performance RSUs to David Bernstein, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; 6,164 Performance RSUs to Gerald R.

Frank, Vice Chairman of the Boards of Directors and Chief Operating Officer.
Each holder of Performance RSUs may earn from 0-200% of his target amount of Performance RSUs depending on the extent of Carnival Corporation & plc's earnings per share growth over the three-year performance period ending with fiscal 2013, subject to his continued employment during the performance period (with earlier partial vesting in certain cases upon eligibility for retirement, or death or disability, prior to the expiration of the performance period). The forms of the Performance RSU award agreement for Performance RSUs made to our named executive officers under the Carnival Corporation 2002 Stock Plan and the Carnival plc 2005 Employee Share Plan are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively.

The Participant waives all and any rights to compensation and damages in consequence of the termination of the Participant's office or employment with any member of the Combined Group or any of its Affiliates for any reason whatsoever (whether lawfully or unlawfully) insofar as those rights arise, or may arise, from the Participant's ceasing to have rights under or the Participant's entitlement to the RSUs under this Agreement as a result of such termination or from the loss or diminution in value of such rights or entitlements.
