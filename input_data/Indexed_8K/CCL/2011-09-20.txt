Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
MIAMI (September 20, 2011)  Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE/LSE: CCL; NYSE: CUK) reported net income of $1.3 billion, or $1.69 diluted EPS, on revenues of $5.1 billion for its third quarter ended August 31, 2011. Net income for the third quarter of 2010 was $1.3 billion, or $1.62 diluted EPS, on revenues of $4.5 billion.
Carnival Corporation & plc Chairman and CEO Micky Arison noted that earnings were better than anticipated in the company's June guidance due to the combination of higher than expected revenue yields and lower than expected costs in the third quarter.
Commenting on the third quarter, Arison said, "Cruise ticket prices for our peak summer season remained strong close to sailing driving a 2.6 percent yield improvement (constant dollars). Our North American brands performed well, achieving an almost six percent yield increase, while our European, Australian and Asian brand yields fell two percent (constant dollars) due primarily to the geo-political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. Higher revenue yields helped offset a 45 percent increase in fuel prices, leading to improved quarterly profits."
Key metrics for the third quarter 2011 compared to the prior year were as follows:
 
 
 
Continuing with its strategic growth initiatives, during the third quarter the company announced it had reached agreements for the construction of three new cruise ships  one 132,500-ton vessel for its Costa Cruises brand and two 125,000-ton ships for its AIDA Cruises brand. The ships will be the largest ever constructed for these two cruise lines.
Outlook
At this time, cumulative advance bookings for the remainder of 2011 and the first half of 2012 are at higher prices with slightly lower occupancies compared to the prior year. Since June, booking volumes for the remainder of the year and the first half of 2012 have run ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices.
Arison noted, "Despite the uncertain economic environment, we have a strong base of business for the first half of 2012, and booking trends during the third quarter have been solid. The increased level of importance consumers are placing on value continues to drive demand for our cruise products."
Arison also noted the company recently repurchased 14.5 million shares of Carnival Corporation & plc stock at a total investment of $445 million. "The current share repurchase program demonstrates our confidence in the earnings power of our global cruise brands. Reduced capital commitments due to the slower pace of our shipbuilding program, along with our strong balance sheet and solid investment grade credit ratings, leave us well positioned to opportunistically return cash to shareholders," Arison stated.
The company continues to expect full year net revenue yields, on a constant dollar basis, to increase 2.0 percent, in line with its June guidance, up 1.5 to 2.5 percent. Net revenue yields on a current dollar basis are expected to increase 4.0 percent for the full year 2011 compared to 2010.
The company expects net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD for the full year 2011 to be up 1.0 percent on a constant dollar basis, at the higher end of its June guidance range, flat to up 1.0 percent, primarily due to the charge related to the sale of Costa Marina.
In addition, changes in fuel prices and currency exchange rates are expected to reduce full year 2011 earnings by $0.06 per share compared to the company's June guidance. Based on the current spot prices for fuel, fuel costs for the full year 2011 are now expected to increase $542 million compared to 2010, costing an additional $0.69 per share.
Taking all the above factors into consideration, the company now forecasts full year 2011 fully diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.44, compared to 2010 earnings of $2.47 per share.
Fourth Quarter 2011
Fourth quarter constant dollar net revenue yields are expected to increase 1.0 to 2.0 percent (up 1.5 to 2.5 percent on a current dollar basis) compared to the prior year. Net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD for the fourth quarter are expected to be down 3.0 to 4.0 percent on a constant dollar basis (down 2.5 to 3.5 percent on a current dollar basis) compared to prior year. Fuel costs for the fourth quarter are expected to increase $171 million compared to the prior year, costing an additional $0.22 per share.
Based on the above factors and using current fuel prices and currency exchange rates, the company expects fully diluted earnings for the fourth quarter 2011 to be in the range of $0.26 to $0.30 per share, compared to $0.31 per share in 2010.

Consolidated gross and net revenue yields were computed by dividing the gross and net cruise revenues, without rounding, by ALBDs as follows (dollars in millions, except yields) (a):
 
Consolidated gross and net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD were computed by dividing the gross and net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel, without rounding, by ALBDs as follows (dollars in millions, except costs per ALBD) (a):
 
(See next page for Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.)
 
Net revenue yields are commonly used in the cruise industry to measure a company's cruise segment revenue performance and for revenue management purposes. We use "net cruise revenues" rather than "gross cruise revenues" to calculate net revenue yields. We believe that net cruise revenues is a more meaningful measure in determining revenue yield than gross cruise revenues because it reflects the cruise revenues earned net of our most significant variable costs, which are travel agent commissions, cost of air and other transportation, certain other costs that are directly associated with onboard and other revenues and credit card fees. Substantially all of our remaining cruise costs are largely fixed, except for the impact of changing prices, once our ship capacity levels have been determined.
Net passenger ticket revenues reflect gross cruise revenues, net of (1) onboard and other revenues, (2) commissions, transportation and other costs and (3) onboard and other cruise costs. Net onboard and other revenues reflect gross cruise revenues, net of (1) passenger ticket revenues, (2) commissions, transportation and other costs and (3) onboard and other cruise costs. Net passenger ticket revenue yields and net onboard and other revenue yields are computed by dividing net passenger ticket revenues and net onboard and other revenues by ALBDs.
Net cruise costs per ALBD and net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD are the most significant measures we use to monitor our ability to control our cruise segment costs rather than gross cruise costs per ALBD. We exclude the same variable costs that are included in the calculation of net cruise revenues to calculate net cruise costs with and without fuel to avoid duplicating these variable costs in our non-GAAP financial measures.
We have not provided estimates of future gross revenue yields or future gross cruise costs per ALBD because the quantitative reconciliations of forecasted gross cruise revenues to forecasted net cruise revenues or forecasted gross cruise costs to forecasted net cruise costs would include a significant amount of uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure. As such, management does not believe that this reconciling information would be meaningful.
In addition, because our Europe, Australia & Asia cruise brands utilize the euro, sterling and Australian dollar to measure their results and financial condition, the translation of those operations to our U.S. dollar reporting currency results in increases in reported U.S. dollar revenues and expenses if the U.S. dollar weakens against these foreign currencies and decreases in reported U.S. dollar revenues and expenses if the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies. Accordingly, we also monitor and report our non-GAAP financial measures assuming the 2011 periods' currency exchange rates have remained constant with the 2010 periods' rates, or on a "constant dollar basis," in order to remove the impact of changes in exchange rates on our non-U.S. dollar cruise operations. We believe that this is a useful measure since it facilitates a comparative view of the growth of our business in a fluctuating currency exchange rate environment.
There are no specific rules for determining our non-GAAP current and constant dollar financial measures and, accordingly, it is possible that they may not be exactly comparable to the like-kind information presented by other cruise companies, which is a potential risk associated with using these measures to compare us to other cruise companies.
