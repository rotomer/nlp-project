Indemnification
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and Carnival plc against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or Carnival plc may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) (i) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or in any amendment thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus, or any amendment or
 
supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Disclosure Package or the Final Prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company or Carnival plc on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein (it being understood and agreed that the only information furnished on behalf of any Underwriter consists of the third paragraph under the caption "Underwriting" in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, concerning the terms of the offering by the Underwriters, and the seventh, eighth and ninth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting" in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, concerning short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales by the Underwriters); and will reimburse the Company or Carnival plc, as applicable, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or Carnival plc in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection except and then only to the extent such indemnifying party is materially prejudiced thereby. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory in the reasonable judgment of such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement or compromise of or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to any such action or claim effected without its consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and Carnival plc on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable, such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company and Carnival plc on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company and Carnival plc on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or Carnival plc on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, Carnival plc and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), an Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities sold by it to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
(e) The obligations of the Company and Carnival plc under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and Carnival plc may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to the directors and officers of an Underwriter and to each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of an Underwriter; and the
 
obligations of an Underwriter under this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which an Underwriter may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and Carnival plc and to each person, if any, who controls the Company or Carnival plc within the meaning of the Act.
8. . If any one or more Underwriters shall fail on the Closing Date to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions for each of the Securities which such Underwriter failed to purchase which the principal amount of the Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule I hereto bears to the aggregate principal amount of such Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth in Schedule I hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all of the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company and Carnival plc. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 8, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives and the Company shall determine in order that the required changes in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company, Carnival plc and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.

The provisions of Sections 4(i), 6 and 7 hereof shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

Re: Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc  Underwriting Agreement
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am the General Counsel of Carnival Corporation, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of Panama (the "Company"), and Carnival plc, a company incorporated and registered under the laws of England and Wales, and have acted as counsel to the Company and Carnival plc in connection with the preparation, authorization, execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), dated November [], 2012, by and between the Company, Carnival plc, Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, RBS Securities Inc. and UBS Securities LLC as Representatives of the underwriters named on Schedule I thereto (the "Underwriters") relating to the issuance and sale by the Company of $[500],000,000 aggregate principal amount of its []% Senior Notes Due 2017, guaranteed by Carnival plc (the "Securities"). This opinion is being furnished to you pursuant to Section 5(b) of the Underwriting Agreement.

In connection with the furnishing of this opinion, I have examined (a) a copy of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, (b) an executed copy of the Underwriting Agreement, (c) the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect on the date hereof (the "Articles of Incorporation"), and the By-laws
of the Company, as in effect on the date hereof (the "By-laws"), (d) copies of the Articles of Association of Carnival plc, as in effect on the date hereof (the "Articles of Association"), and the Memorandum of Association of Carnival plc, as in effect on the date hereof (the "Memorandum of Association"), (e) certain minutes of a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company and Carnival plc, (f) certain resolutions adopted by the Debt Committees of the Company and Carnival plc, and (g) certain other corporate records of the Company and Carnival plc. I have also examined such other documents and made such other investigations, as I have deemed necessary in connection with the opinions expressed below. As to certain factual matters, I have relied upon certificates of public officials delivered to you on the date hereof. In rendering the opinions set forth below, I have assumed without independent investigation that the signatures of all documents and instruments submitted to me as originals are authentic and all documents and instruments submitted to me as copies conform with the originals thereof.
Based upon the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:
1. The Company is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure to so qualify would have a Material Adverse Effect.
2. Carnival plc is duly qualified to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure to so qualify would have a Material Adverse Effect.
3. To my knowledge, and subject to the assumption below, the issuance and sale of the Securities, the compliance by the Company and Carnival plc with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the imposition of a lien or security interest under, any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company, Carnival plc or any Significant Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company, Carnival plc or any Significant
Subsidiary is bound or to which any of the property or assets used in the conduct of the business of the Company, Carnival plc or any Significant Subsidiary is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, the Articles of Association or the Memorandum of Association of Carnival plc, or the charter, by-laws or similar organizational documents of any Significant Subsidiary or any statute or any judgment, order, rule or regulation of any court or arbitrator or governmental or regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Company, Carnival plc or any Significant Subsidiary or any of their properties.
4. Other than as set forth in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company, Carnival plc or any of their Significant Subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company, Carnival plc or any of their Significant Subsidiaries is the subject which, if determined adversely to the Company, Carnival plc or any of their Significant Subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect and, to the best of my knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others.
5. Each document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, Disclosure Package and Final Prospectus (except in each case for the financial statements and other financial data included or incorporated therein, as to which I express no opinion) appeared on its face, as of its respective filing date, to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
I am a member of the Bar of the State of Florida and do not purport to be an expert in, or to express any opinion concerning, the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Florida and the Federal laws of the United States.

As Representatives of the
several Underwriters listed
in Schedule I to the Underwriting Agreement
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to Carnival Corporation, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of Panama (the "Company"), and Carnival plc, a company incorporated and registered under the laws of England and Wales (the "Guarantor"), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), dated as of November [], 2012, among the Representatives named on Schedule II thereto, as representatives of the underwriters named on Schedule I thereto (the "Underwriters"), the Company and the Guarantor, relating to the purchase today by the Underwriters of $[500],000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's []% Senior Notes Due 2017 (the "Notes"). This opinion is being furnished at the request of the Company and the Guarantor as contemplated by Section 5(c) of the Underwriting Agreement. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this letter have the respective meanings given those terms in the Underwriting Agreement.
The Company and the Guarantor have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (File Numbers 333-179936 and 333-179936-01) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). The Registration Statement was filed on March 6, 2012 and automatically became effective pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Act. In this letter, the Registration Statement as amended as of the Execution Time, including the documents incorporated by reference therein and the information deemed to be part of the Registration Statement under Rule 430B under the Act, is referred to as the "Registration Statement"; the base prospectus dated March 6, 2012 included as part of the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the preliminary prospectus supplement dated November [], 2012, including the documents incorporated by reference therein immediately prior to the
Applicable Time, is referred to as the "Preliminary Prospectus"; the Preliminary Prospectus, taken together with the information set forth in the term sheet dated November [], 2012 attached as Schedule IV to the Underwriting Agreement, is referred to as the "Disclosure Package"; and the base prospectus dated March 6, 2012 included as part of the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the final prospectus supplement dated November [], 2012, including the documents incorporated by reference therein as of its date, is referred to as the "Final Prospectus."
We have been advised orally by the staff of the Commission that no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued and to our knowledge no proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or are pending or are threatened by the Commission.
In connection with the furnishing of this opinion, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the following documents:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, we have examined those certificates, agreements and documents as we deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions and beliefs expressed below. We have also relied upon oral and written statements of officers and representatives of the Company and the Guarantor, the factual matters contained in the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor made in the Underwriting Agreement and upon certificates of the officers of the Company and the Guarantor.
In our examination of the documents referred to above, we have assumed, without independent investigation, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all individuals who have executed any of the documents reviewed by us, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as certified, photostatic, reproduced or conformed copies of
valid existing agreements or other documents, the authenticity of the latter documents and that the statements regarding matters of fact in the certificates, records, agreements, instruments and documents that we have examined are accurate and complete. We have also assumed, without independent investigation, that (i) the Company is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) the Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes, (iii) the execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and does not violate the Company's organizational documents or the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (iv) the due execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes by the Company, (v) the Guarantor is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (vi) the Guarantor has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Guarantees, (vii) the execution, delivery and performance of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Guarantees has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and does not violate the Guarantor's organizational documents or the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and (viii) the due execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Guarantees by the Guarantor. We have also assumed that you have complied with all of your obligations and agreements arising under the Underwriting Agreement, that the Indenture has been duly authorized and executed by, and represents a valid and legally binding obligation of, the Trustee and the due authentication of the Notes by the Trustee in the manner described in the certificate of the Trustee delivered to you today.
Based upon the above, and subject to the stated assumptions, exceptions and qualifications, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Notes, when duly authenticated by the Trustee, and duly issued and delivered by the Company against payment as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except that the enforceability of the Notes may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Notes, when issued and delivered, will conform in all material respects to the description contained in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of the Notes."
2. When the Notes are duly issued and delivered by the Company against payment as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, each Guarantee of the Guarantor will be a valid and legally binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except that enforceability of the Guarantee may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Guarantees, when issued and delivered, will conform in all material respects to the description contained in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of the Notes."
3. The Indenture is a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company and the Guarantor, enforceable against the Company and the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except that the enforceability of the Indenture may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and the Indenture conforms in all material respects to its description thereof contained in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus under the captions "Description of Debt Securities" and "Description of the Notes." The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.
4. The statements in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus under the heading "Material Panamanian, U.S. Federal Income Tax and U.K. Withholding Tax Consequences  United States," to the extent that they constitute summaries of United States federal law or regulation or legal conclusions, have been reviewed by us and fairly summarize the matters described under that heading in all material respects.
5. The Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, as of their respective effective or issue times, appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Act (the "Rules and Regulations"), except for the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference in or omitted from any of them and the Form T-1, as to which we express no opinion.
6. The issuance and sale of the Notes and the Guarantees by the Company and the Guarantor, the compliance by the Company and the Guarantor with all of the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees and the performance by the Company and the Guarantor of their obligations thereunder will not violate Applicable Law or any judgment, order or decree of any court or arbitrator listed on Schedule II hereto, except where the violation could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company, the Guarantor and their subsidiaries taken as a whole. For purposes of this letter, the term "Applicable Law" means those laws, rules and regulations of the United States of America and the State of New York, in each case which in our experience are normally applicable to the transactions of the type contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees except that "Applicable Law" does not include federal securities laws (except for purposes of the opinion expressed in paragraph 7 below) or state securities laws, other anti-fraud laws, or any law, rule or regulation that is applicable to the Company, the Indenture, the Notes, the Underwriting Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby solely because such law, rule or regulation is part of a regulatory regime applicable to any party to the Underwriting Agreement or any of its affiliates due to the specific assets or business of such party or such affiliate.
7. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing, registration or qualification with, any Governmental Authority, which has not been obtained, taken or made is required by the Company or the Guarantor under any Applicable Law for the issuance or sale of the Notes and the Guarantees by the Company and the Guarantor or the performance by the Company and the Guarantor of their respective obligations under the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees. For purposes of this letter, the term "Governmental Authority" means any executive, legislative, judicial, administrative or regulatory body of the State of New York or the United States of America.
8. The Company and the Guarantor are not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Notes, and the application of their proceeds as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus under the heading "Use of Proceeds," neither the Company nor the Guarantor will be required to be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated thereunder.
The opinions expressed above are limited to the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America. Our opinions are rendered only with respect to the laws, and the rules, regulations and orders under those laws, that are currently in effect.
This letter is furnished by us solely for your benefit in connection with the transactions referred to in the Underwriting Agreement and may not be circulated to, or relied upon by, any other person without our prior written consent.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to Carnival Corporation, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of Panama (the "Company"), and Carnival plc, a company incorporated and registered under the laws of England and Wales (the "Guarantor"), in connection with the Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), dated as of November [], 2012, among the Representatives named on Schedule II thereto, as Representatives of the underwriters named on Schedule I thereto (the "Underwriters"), the Company and the Guarantor, relating to the purchase today by the Underwriters of $[500],000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's []% Senior Notes Due 2017 (the "Notes"). This letter is being furnished at the request of the Company and the Guarantor in connection with the delivery of our opinion to you of even date herewith (the "Opinion") under the Underwriting Agreement. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this letter have the respective meanings given those terms in the Underwriting Agreement.
The Company and the Guarantor have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (File Numbers 333-179936 and 333-179936-01) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). The Registration Statement was filed on March 6, 2012 and automatically became effective pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Act. In this letter, the Registration Statement as amended as of the Execution Time, including the documents incorporated by reference therein and the information deemed to be part of the Registration Statement under Rule 430B under the Act, is referred to as the "Registration Statement"; the base prospectus dated March 6, 2012 included as part of the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the preliminary prospectus supplement dated November [], 2012, including the documents incorporated by reference therein immediately prior to the Applicable Time, is referred to as the "Preliminary Prospectus;" the Preliminary Prospectus, taken together with the information set forth in the Term Sheet dated November [], 2012 attached as Schedule IV to the Underwriting Agreement (the "term sheet"), is referred to as the "Disclosure Package"; and the base prospectus dated March 6, 2012 included as part of the Registration Statement, as supplemented by the final prospectus supplement dated November [], 2012, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, is referred to as the "Final Prospectus."
The primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish factual matters or financial, accounting or statistical information. In addition, many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, Preliminary Prospectus and the
Final Prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference therein are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of the Opinion. Furthermore, the limitations inherent in the independent verification of factual matters and in the role of outside counsel are such that we have not undertaken to independently verify, and cannot and do not assume responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of, the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Final Prospectus or the documents incorporated by reference therein (other than as explicitly stated in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Opinion).
In the course of acting as special counsel to the Company and the Guarantor in connection with the offering of the Notes, we have participated in conferences and telephone conversations with officers and other representatives of the Company and the Guarantor and the independent registered public accountants for the Company and the Guarantor during which conferences and conversations the contents of the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Final Prospectus and related matters were discussed. Based upon such participation (and relying as to factual matters on officers, employees and other representatives of the Company and the Guarantor), and our understanding of the U.S. federal securities laws and the experience we have gained in our practice thereunder, we hereby advise you that our work in connection with this matter did not disclose any information that gave us reason to believe that (i) at the time it became effective and the Execution Time, the Registration Statement (except for the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or from those documents incorporated by reference and the Form T-1, as to which we express no such belief),
included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; (ii) as of the Applicable Time, the Disclosure Package (except for the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or from those documents incorporated by reference, as to which we express no such belief) included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (iii) as of its date and the date hereof, the Final Prospectus (except for the financial statements, financial statement schedules and other financial data included or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom or from those documents incorporated by reference, as to which we express no such belief) included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

The Company shall cause to be kept at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 10.2 a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall, subject to the provisions of Section 2.5, provide for the registration of Securities and transfers of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.

Subject to the provisions of Section 2.5, at the option of the Holder, definitive Securities of any series may be exchanged for other definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the definitive Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any definitive Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the definitive Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
 
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto.
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue or register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the selection for redemption of Securities of that series under Section 11.3 and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing of notice of redemption, (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part, or (iii) to issue or register the transfer of or exchange any Security which has been surrendered for repayment at the option of the Holder, except the portion, if any, of such Security not to be so repaid.
Section 3.6. . If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, or, in case any such mutilated Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Securities
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding or, in case any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
Section 3.7. . Interest on any Security which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 10.2; ,, that each installment of interest on any Security may at the Company's option be paid by mailing a check for such interest, payable to or upon the written order of the Person entitled thereto pursuant to Section 3.8, to the address of such Person as it appears on the Security Register.

Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment.

Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (ii).
(ii) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.

Section 13.2. . The Company may (1) deliver to the Trustee Outstanding Securities of a series (other than any previously called for redemption) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company and (2) receive credit for Securities of a series which have been previously delivered to the Trustee by the Company or for Securities of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of the same series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as provided for by the terms of such Series, that such Securities have not been previously so credited.

Such certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its delivery the Company shall be obligated to make the cash payment or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date.

NOW THEREFORE:
In consideration of the promises provided for herein, the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree as follows:
Section 101
Provisions Applicable to All Series of Securities.
The provisions contained in this Article One shall apply to all Securities issued under the Indenture on or after the date hereof.
Section 102 .
Payment of Additional Amounts
The Indenture is hereby amended by replacing Section 10.5 in its entirety with the following:
"Section 10.5 . (a) The Company hereby agrees that any amounts to be paid by the Company with respect to each Security shall be paid without deduction or withholding for any and all present and future taxes, levies, imposts or other governmental charges ("Taxes") whatsoever imposed, assessed, levied or collected by or for the account of (i)(x) the Republic of Panama or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or (y) the jurisdiction of incorporation (other than the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof) of a successor corporation to the Company pursuant to Section 8.1, to the extent that such Taxes first become applicable as a result of the successor corporation becoming the obligor on the Securities, or (ii) any jurisdiction (other than the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof) from or through which any amount is paid by the Company hereunder or where it is resident or maintains a place of business or permanent establishment (each jurisdiction described in clauses (i) and (ii) above is referred to herein as a "Taxing Jurisdiction"), unless the withholding or deduction of such Tax is compelled by laws of the Republic of Panama or any other applicable Taxing Jurisdiction. If any deduction or withholding of any Taxes (other than Excluded Taxes, as defined below) is ever required by the Republic of Panama or any other Taxing Jurisdiction, the Company shall (subject to compliance by the Holder or beneficial owner of any Security with any relevant administrative requirements) pay such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") required to make the net amounts paid to the Holder of such Security or the Trustee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture or the Securities, after such deduction or withholding, equal to the amounts of principal, premium, if any, interest, if any, and sinking fund or analogous payments, if any, to which such Holder or the Trustee is entitled. However, the Company shall not be required to pay Additional Amounts in respect of the following Taxes ("Excluded Taxes"):
Additional Amounts
 
 
 
 
 
, that no such Additional Amounts shall be payable in respect of any Security held by (x) any Holder or beneficial owner that is not the sole beneficial owner of such Security, or that is a fiduciary, partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, but only to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary or a beneficial owner, partner or member of the partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, would not have been entitled to such Additional Amounts had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner, partner or member been the direct holder of such Security, (y) any Holder that is not a resident of the United States to the extent that, had such Holder been a resident of the United States and eligible (taking into account any applicable limitation on benefits article or similar provision) for the benefit of any double taxation treaty between the United States and the applicable Taxing Jurisdiction in relation to payments of amounts due under this Indenture and any Security, such Holder would not have been entitled to such Additional Amounts, or (z) any Holder that is a resident of the United States but that is not eligible for the benefit of any double taxation treaty between the United States, and the applicable Taxing Jurisdiction in relation to payments of amounts due under this Indenture and any Security (but only to the extent the amount of such deduction or withholding exceeds that which would have been required had such Holder of a Security been so eligible and made all relevant claims).
provided further
The Company or any successor to the Company, as the case may be, shall indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of a Security and upon written request reimburse each Holder for the amount of (i) any Taxes levied or imposed by the Republic of Panama or any other applicable Taxing Jurisdiction and paid by such Holder of any Security (other than Excluded Taxes) as a
 
result of payments made with respect to such Security, (ii) any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising from or in connection with the levying or imposing of any Taxes (other than Excluded Taxes) by the Republic of Panama or any other applicable Taxing Jurisdiction with respect to any Security, and (iii) any Taxes (other than Excluded Taxes) levied or imposed by the Republic of Panama or any other applicable Taxing Jurisdiction with respect to payment of Additional Amounts or any reimbursement pursuant to this sentence, in each case, to the extent not otherwise reimbursed by the payment of any Additional Amount and not excluded from the requirement to pay Additional Amounts, as described above.
The Company or any successor to the Company, as the case may be, shall also (i) make such withholding or deduction to the extent required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law. The Company or any successor to the Company, as the case may be, shall furnish the Trustee within 30 days after the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law, certified copies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Company or any successor to the Company, as the case may be, or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee. It is understood, however, that the Trustee is under no obligation to request such certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment.
At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Securities is due and payable, if the Company will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payments, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable, stating the amounts so payable and setting forth such other information as may be necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such Additional Amounts to Holders of the Securities on the payment date.
Whenever in this Indenture or any Security there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of the principal, premium, if any, or interest, or sinking fund or analogous payment, if any, in respect of such Security or overdue principal or overdue interest or overdue sinking fund or analogous payment, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts provided for herein to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this Section and express mention thereof in any provisions hereof shall not be construed as excluding Additional Amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made (if applicable).
The obligations of the Company (and any successor corporation to the Company pursuant to Section 8.1) under this Section 10.5 shall survive the termination of this Indenture and the payment of all amounts under or with respect to the Securities.
(b) Each Holder of a Security, by acceptance of such Security, agrees that, with reasonable promptness after receiving written notice from the Company to the effect that such Holder is eligible for a refund in respect of Taxes actually paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 10.5, such Holder will sign and deliver, as reasonably directed by the Company, any form provided to such Holder by the Company to enable such Holder to obtain a refund in respect of such Taxes; and if such Holder thereafter receives such refund in respect of such Taxes, such Holder will promptly pay such refund to the Company (together with interest, if any,
 
received by such Holder from the relevant taxing authority). If a Holder applies for a refund of such Taxes prior to a request by the Company to apply for such a refund, the Holder will, upon receipt of a request by the Company to apply for, or to turn over the proceeds of, any such refund, pay any such refund to the Company (together with interest, if any, received by such Holder from the relevant taxing authority), promptly upon receipt of such refund. The Company shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by a Holder in connection with obtaining such refund."
Section 103 .
Optional Redemption or Assumption of Securities Under Certain Circumstances
The Indenture is hereby amended by replacing Section 11.8 in its entirety with the following:
"Section 11.8 . (a)(i) Unless otherwise specified with respect to the Securities of any series, if as the result of any change in or any amendment to the laws, including any regulations thereunder and any applicable double taxation treaty or convention, of the Republic of Panama (or the jurisdiction of incorporation (other than the United States) of a successor corporation to the Company pursuant to Section 8.1), or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein affecting taxation, or any change in an application or interpretation of such laws, including any applicable double taxation treaty or convention, which change, amendment, application or interpretation ("Change") becomes effective on or after the original issuance date of such series (or, if such Change is imposed with respect to tax imposed with respect to payments from the jurisdiction in which a successor corporation to the Company pursuant to Section 8.1 is incorporated, such later date on which such successor corporation becomes a successor corporation to the Company pursuant to Section 8.1), it is determined by the Company based upon an opinion of independent counsel of recognized standing that (i) the Company would be required to pay Additional Amounts (as defined in Section 10.5 herein) in respect of principal, premium, if any, interest, if any, or sinking fund or analogous payments, if any, on the next succeeding date for the payment thereof (and such obligation could not be avoided by the Company taking reasonable measures available to it), or (ii) any taxes would be imposed (whether by way of deduction, withholding or otherwise) by the Republic of Panama (or the jurisdiction of incorporation (other than the United States) of a successor corporation to the Company pursuant to Section 8.1) or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, upon or with respect to any principal, premium, if any, interest, if any, or sinking fund or analogous payments, if any, then the Company may, at its option, on giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice (which shall be irrevocable) redeem such series of Securities in whole, but not in part, at any time (except in the case of Securities of a series having a variable rate of interest, which may be redeemed only on an Interest Payment Date) at a Redemption Price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date (except in the case of outstanding Original Issue Discount Securities which may be redeemed at the Redemption Price specified by the terms of each series of such Securities); , , that (i) no notice of redemption may be given more than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Company would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts or such tax would be imposed, as the case may be, and (ii) at the time that such notice of redemption is given, such obligation to pay Additional Amounts or such tax, as the case may be, remains in effect.
Optional Redemption or Assumption of Securities Under Certain Circumstances
provided
however
 
(ii) Unless otherwise specified with respect to the Securities of any series, if as the result of any change in or any amendment to the laws, including any regulations thereunder and any applicable double taxation treaty or convention, of the United Kingdom (or the jurisdiction of tax residence (other than the United States) of a successor corporation to the Guarantor pursuant to Section 8.1), or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein affecting taxation, or any change in an application or interpretation of such laws, including any applicable double taxation treaty or convention, which change, amendment, application or interpretation ("Change") becomes effective on or after the original issuance date of such series (or, if such Change is imposed with respect to tax imposed with respect to payments from the jurisdiction in which a successor corporation to the Guarantor pursuant to Section 8.1 has tax residence, such later date on which such successor corporation becomes a successor corporation to the Guarantor pursuant to Section 8.1), it is determined by the Guarantor based upon an opinion of independent counsel of recognized standing that (i) the Guarantor would be required to pay Guarantor Additional Amounts (as defined in Section 15.2 herein) in respect of principal, premium, if any, interest, if any, or sinking fund or analogous payments, if any, on the next succeeding date for the payment thereof (and such obligation could not be avoided by the Guarantor taking reasonable measures available to it), or (ii) any taxes would be imposed (whether by way of deduction, withholding or otherwise) by the United Kingdom (or the jurisdiction of tax residence (other than the United States) of a successor corporation to the Guarantor pursuant to Section 8.1) or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, upon or with respect to any principal, premium, if any, interest, if any, or sinking fund or analogous payments, if any, then the Company or the Guarantor may, at its option, on giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice (which shall be irrevocable) redeem such series of Securities in whole, but not in part, at any time (except in the case of Securities of a series having a variable rate of interest, which may be redeemed only on an Interest Payment Date) at a Redemption Price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date (except in the case of outstanding Original Issue Discount Securities which may be redeemed at the Redemption Price specified by the terms of each series of such Securities); , , that (i) no notice of redemption may be given more than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Guarantor would be obligated to pay such Guarantor Additional Amounts or such tax would be imposed, as the case may be, and (ii) at the time that such notice of redemption is given, such obligation to pay Guarantor Additional Amounts or such tax, as the case may be, remains in effect.
provided
however
(b) Prior to any redemption of a series of Securities pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the Company or the Guarantor shall provide the Trustee with an opinion of independent counsel of recognized standing which states that the conditions precedent to the right of the Company or the Guarantor to redeem such Securities pursuant to this Section shall have occurred. Each such opinion of independent counsel of recognized standing shall be based on the laws in effect on the date of such opinion or to become effective on or before the next succeeding date of payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, if any, and sinking fund or analogous payments, if any. For purposes of this Section, all references to the Company or the Guarantor in this paragraph shall include any successor corporation thereto pursuant to Section 8.1."
 
Section 104
Guarantor Gross-up.
The Indenture is hereby amended by replacing Section 15.2 in its entirety with the following:
"Section 15.2 . (a) All payments with respect to this Indenture and the Securities made by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantees shall be governed by this Section 15.2, and the Guarantor shall cause all such payments to be paid without deduction or withholding for any and all present and future taxes, levies, imposts or other governmental charges ("Guarantor Jurisdiction Taxes") whatsoever imposed, assessed, levied or collected by or for the account of (i)(x) the United Kingdom or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or (y) the jurisdiction of tax residence (other than the United States, or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof) of a successor corporation to the Guarantor, to the extent that such Guarantor Jurisdiction Taxes first become applicable as a result of such successor corporation becoming the obligor on the Guarantee, as applicable, or (ii) any other jurisdiction (other than the United States, or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof) from or through which any amount is paid by the Guarantor hereunder or where it is resident or maintains a place of business or permanent establishment (each jurisdiction described in clauses (i) and (ii) above is referred to herein as a "Guarantor Taxing Jurisdiction"), unless the withholding or deduction of such Guarantor Jurisdiction Tax is compelled by laws of the United Kingdom, or any other applicable Guarantor Taxing Jurisdiction. If any deduction or withholding of any Guarantor Jurisdiction Taxes (other than Guarantor Excluded Taxes, as defined below) is ever required by the United Kingdom or any other Guarantor Taxing Jurisdiction, the Guarantor shall (subject to compliance by the Holder or beneficial owner of each Security with any applicable administrative requirements) pay such additional amounts ("Guarantor Additional Amounts") required to make the net amounts paid to each Holder pursuant to the terms of this Indenture or the Securities after such deduction or withholding equal to the amounts then due and payable under the terms of this Indenture or the Securities. However, the Guarantor shall not be required to pay Guarantor Additional Amounts in respect of the following Taxes ("Guarantor Excluded Taxes"):
Guarantor Gross-up
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
, that no such Guarantor Additional Amounts shall be payable in respect of any Security held by (x) any Holder or beneficial owner that is not the sole beneficial owner of such Security, or that is a fiduciary, partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, but only to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary or a beneficial owner, partner or member of the partnership, limited liability company or other fiscally transparent entity, would not have been entitled to such Guarantor Additional Amounts had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner, partner or member been the direct holder of such Security, (y) any Holder that is not a resident of the United States to the extent that, had such Holder been a resident of the United States and eligible for the benefit of any double taxation treaty between the United States, and the applicable Guarantor Taxing Jurisdiction in relation to payments of amounts due under this Indenture and any Security, such Holder would not have
provided further
 
been entitled to such Guarantor Additional Amounts, or (z) any Holder that is a resident of the United States but that is not eligible for the benefit of any double taxation treaty between the United States and the applicable Guarantor Taxing Jurisdiction in relation to payments of amounts due under this Indenture and any Security (but only to the extent the amount of such deduction or withholding exceeds that which would have been required had such Holder of a Security been so eligible and made all relevant claims).
The Guarantor or any successor to it, as the case may be, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of a Security and upon written request reimburse each Holder for the amount of (i) any Guarantor Jurisdiction Taxes levied or imposed and paid by such Holder of a Security (other than Guarantor Excluded Taxes) as a result of payments made with respect to such Security, (ii) any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, and (iii) any Guarantor Jurisdiction Taxes (other than Guarantor Excluded Taxes) with respect to payment of Guarantor Additional Amounts or any reimbursement pursuant to this sentence, in each case, to the extent not otherwise reimbursed by the payment of any Guarantor Additional Amount and not excluded from the requirement to pay Guarantor Additional Amounts as described above. The Guarantor or any successor to it, as the case may be, shall also (i) make such withholding or deduction to the extent required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant authority in accordance with applicable law.
The Guarantor or any successor to it, as the case may be, shall furnish the Trustee within 30 days after the date the payment of any such Guarantor Jurisdiction Taxes is due, certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment by the Guarantor or any successor to it, as the case may be, or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee. It is understood, however, that the Trustee is under no obligation to request such certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment.
At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to a Security is due and payable by the Guarantor under the Guarantees, if the Guarantor will be obligated to pay Guarantor Additional Amounts with respect to those payments, the Guarantor shall deliver to the Trustee an officers' certificate stating that Guarantor Additional Amounts will be payable, stating the amounts that will be payable, and setting forth any other information necessary to enable the Trustee to pay the Guarantor Additional Amounts to holders of such Security on the payment date.
(b) Each Holder of a Security, by acceptance of such Security, agrees that, with reasonable promptness after receiving written notice from the Guarantor to the effect that such Holder is eligible for a refund in respect of Guarantor Jurisdiction Taxes actually paid by the Guarantor pursuant to this Section 15.2, such Holder will sign and deliver, as reasonably directed by the Guarantor, any form provided to such Holder by the Guarantor to enable such Holder to obtain a refund in respect of such Guarantor Jurisdiction Taxes; and if such Holder thereafter receives such refund in respect of such Guarantor Jurisdiction Taxes, such Holder will promptly pay such refund to the Guarantor (together with interest, if any, received by such Holder from the relevant taxing authority). If a Holder applies for a refund of such Guarantor Jurisdiction Taxes prior to a request by the Guarantor to apply for such a refund, the Holder will, upon receipt of a
 
request by the Guarantor to apply for, or to turn over the proceeds of, any such refund, pay any such refund to the Guarantor (together with interest, if any, received by such Holder from the relevant taxing authority), promptly upon receipt of such refund.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to Carnival Corporation, a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Panama (the "Company"), and Carnival plc, a company incorporated and registered under the laws of England and Wales (the "Guarantor"), in connection with the Registration Statement on Form S-3ASR (File Nos. 333-179936 and 333-179936-01) (the "Registration Statement"), which became effective on March 6, 2012. You have asked us to furnish our opinion as to the legality of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Company's 1.875% Senior Notes Due 2017 (the "Notes"), including the guarantees thereof (the "Guarantees"), which are registered under the Registration Statement and which are being sold today pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated as of November 29, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), by and among the representatives named on Schedule II thereto, as representatives of the underwriters named on Schedule I thereto (the "Underwriters"), the Company and the Guarantor.
The Notes and the related Guarantees are to be issued under an indenture, dated as of December 6, 2012 (the "Base Indenture"), by and among the Company, the Guarantor and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the supplemental indenture, dated as of December 6, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), among the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee and pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Offering Committee of the Company on November 29, 2012, as authorized by the Company's Board of Directors.
In connection with the furnishing of this opinion, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the following documents:
1. the Registration Statement;
2. the preliminary prospectus supplement dated November 29, 2012 (the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement");
3. the pricing term sheet dated November 29, 2012 set forth on Schedule IV to the Underwriting Agreement;
4. the final prospectus supplement dated November 29, 2012 (the "Final Prospectus," together with the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement, the "Prospectus Supplement");
5. the Underwriting Agreement;
6. the Indenture; and
7. the form of Notes to be issued on the date of this letter.
In addition, we have examined such other certificates, agreements and documents that we deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below. We have also relied upon the factual matters contained in the representations and warranties of the Company and the Guarantor made in the documents reviewed by us and upon certificates of public officials and the officers of the Company and the Guarantor.
In our examination of the documents referred to above, we have assumed, without independent investigation, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all individuals who have executed any of the documents reviewed by us, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as certified, photostatic, reproduced or conformed copies of valid existing agreements or other documents, the authenticity of all such latter documents and that the statements regarding matters of fact in the certificates, records, agreements, instruments and documents that we have examined are accurate and complete.
 
We have also assumed, without independent investigation, that (i) the Company is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) the Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes, (iii) the execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture and the Notes has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and does not violate the Company's organizational documents or the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (iv) the due execution and delivery of the Indenture and the Notes by the Company, (v) the Guarantor is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (vi) the Guarantor has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Indenture and the Guarantees, (vii) the execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture and the Guarantees has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and does not violate the Guarantor's organizational documents or the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and (viii) the due execution and delivery of the Indenture and the Guarantees by the Guarantor. We have also assumed that the Indenture has been duly authorized and executed by, and represents a valid and legally binding obligation of, the Trustee and the due authentication of the Notes by the Trustee.
Based upon the above, and subject to the stated assumptions, exceptions and qualifications, we are of the opinion that:
1. The Notes, when duly authenticated by the Trustee, and duly issued and delivered by the Company against payment as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except that the enforceability of the Notes may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
2. When the Notes are duly issued and delivered by the Company against payment as provided in the Underwriting Agreement, the Guarantee of the Guarantor will be a valid and legally binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with their terms, except that enforceability of the Guarantees may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
The opinions expressed above are limited to the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States of America. Our opinions are rendered only with respect to the laws, and the rules, regulations and orders under those laws, that are currently in effect.
We hereby consent to use of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the use of our name under the heading "Legal Matters" in the base
 
prospectus included in the Registration Statement and in the Final Prospectus. In giving this consent, we do not hereby admit that we come within the category of persons whose consent is required by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.
