EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Robert J. Hugin Senior VP and CFO Celgene Corporation (732) 271-4102 CELGENE BROADENS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ESTATE COVERING THALIDOMIDE ANALOGS Celgene, EntreMed Sign Agreements To Terminate Litigation Five-Year Collaboration to Develop Novel Anti-Cancer Therapies Initiated with Children's Hospital, Boston Celgene Acquires Equity Stake in EntreMed WARREN, NJ - (January 2, 2003) - Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) announced today that it has broadened its thalidomide analog patent estate through the acquisition of exclusive rights to the intellectual property covering thalidomide analogs from Children's Hospital, Boston and EntreMed, Inc. The agreements also provide for the termination of related litigation between the companies. Under the terms of the agreements, Celgene will acquire a significant equity stake in EntreMed and will enter into a five-year research collaboration with Children's Hospital to develop novel anti-cancer agents. "This transaction broadens our intellectual property estate for one of our most significant programs, the IMiDs. The elimination of a potentially lengthy litigation will allow us to further intensify our focus on the development of REVIMID and the entire IMiD class of products," said Robert J. Hugin, Chief Financial Officer of Celgene Corporation. "We are pleased that our research efforts have been strengthened by this new collaboration with Children's Hospital, a world-class research institution. I am confident that our equity investment will assist EntreMed in the achievement of their corporate objectives." Under the terms of the agreements, Celgene will receive convertible preferred stock and warrants from EntreMed in exchange for $16.75 million. The preferred stock is convertible into 16,750,000 shares of common stock at an equivalent price of $1.00 per share. The warrants, which may be exercised on a net issue basis, may be issued for up to 7,000,000 shares of common stock after six months at an exercise price of $1.50 per share. The agreements were completed on December 31, 2002 and will be accounted for in the fourth quarter of 2002. If Celgene chooses to convert all of the preferred stock and exercise all of the warrants, Celgene would own approximately 49 percent of EntreMed based on the shares of EntreMed's common stock currently outstanding. Celgene has also made a $10 million cash payment to EntreMed in connection with the litigation settlement. In addition, Celgene has obtained a one-year option to license one of three preclinical oncology products currently under development at EntreMed. Celgene and Children's Hospital have agreed to enter into a five-year sponsored research collaboration totaling $1.5 million over the term of the research. In consideration for the termination of the EntreMed Analog Agreements, Celgene made a $2.5 million payment to Children's Hospital with another $2.5 million payable by 2006. Additional payments are possible under the agreement dependent on the successful development and commercialization of thalidomide analogs. IMiDs IMiDS are novel, small molecule, orally available compounds that modulate the immune system. Data published in The Journal of Immunology demonstrated that IMiDs potently inhibit the inflammatory cytokines and growth factors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that are involved in tumor development. IMiDs were also reported in Blood to enhance T-cell proliferation, IL-2 production and apoptosis (cell death). Celgene has advanced two IMiDs, REVIMID(TM) (CC-5013) and ACTIMID(TM) (CC-4047), into clinical trials in cancer and inflammatory diseases. At the American Society of Hematology annual meeting in December, clinical investigators presented data on REVIMID, the lead IMiD, in both multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes that indicated REVIMID has significant anti-tumor activity in both indications. Celgene recently initiated two pivotal programs for REVIMID in multiple myeloma and metastatic melanoma that consist of multi-center, controlled, double-blind trials conducted in the United States and internationally. ACTIMID, the next IMiD, is being tested in a Phase I/II clinical trial in refractory multiple myeloma. Interim data from this trial was presented at the annual meeting of the International Society for Experimental Hematology and demonstrated that ACTIMID has anti-tumor activity in multiple myeloma and has an acceptable toxicity profile. Celgene Corporation, headquartered in Warren, New Jersey, is an independent biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases through gene and protein regulation.
