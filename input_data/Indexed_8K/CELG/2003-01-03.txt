Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets. On December 31, 2002 (the "Effective Time"), Celgene Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Registrant"), consummated the acquisition of Anthrogenesis Corp., a New Jersey corporation ("Anthrogenesis"). Anthrogenesis is an early-stage biotherapeutics company delivering stem cell therapies produced from renewable human placental sources/materials. The merger was consummated pursuant to the Purchase Option Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated April 26, 2002, as amended (the "Plan of Merger"), by and among the Registrant, Celgene Acquisition Corp., a New Jersey corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant (the "Merger Sub"), and Anthrogenesis. Pursuant to the Plan of Merger, the Merger Sub merged with and into Anthrogenesis, and Anthrogenesis continued as the surviving corporation. At the Effective Time, Anthrogenesis became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant. Under the Plan of Merger, each share of Anthrogenesis common stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the merger was converted into the right to receive 0.4545 of a share of the Registrant's common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"). The Registrant issued approximately 1.45 million shares of Common Stock to former Anthrogenesis shareholders in the merger. In addition, approximately 1.3 million shares of the Registrant's Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding Anthrogenesis stock options and warrants that were assumed by the Registrant pursuant to the Plan of Merger. These options and warrants were converted into options and warrants to acquire shares of the Registrant's Common Stock on the basis of the 0.4545 exchange ratio in the merger. Prior to the completion of the merger, the shares of the Registrant's Common Stock that were issued and reserved for issuance in connection with the merger were registered under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-101196) (the "Registration Statement"). The Registration Statement was declared effective on November 26, 2002. The merger is described in greater detail in the Registration Statement. The Registrant's acquisition of Anthrogenesis was structured as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. The foregoing description of the Plan of Merger does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan of Merger, including the amendment dated September 6, 2002 which, among other things, sets forth the exchange ratio, which are incorporated herein by reference as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 99.1 Contact: Robert J. Hugin Senior VP and CFO Celgene Corporation (732) 271-4102 CELGENE COMPLETES ANTHROGENESIS ACQUISITION Celgene Leverages Commercial and Scientific Franchises to Develop Transforming Placental Stem Cell Therapeutics WARREN, NJ - (January 2, 2003) - Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) announced today the completion of its merger with Anthrogenesis Corporation, a privately held biotherapeutics company pioneering the recovery of stem cells from human placental tissue. Anthrogenesis has developed proprietary methods for collecting, processing and storing placental stem cells and has organized three main business units: stem cell transplantation, private stem cell banking and the development of biomaterials for organ and tissue repair. Anthrogenesis will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene. Anthrogenesis' proprietary technology procures large quantities of high-potential stem cells from human placental tissue. These stem cells can be used in bone marrow transplants to treat cancer, particularly hematological cancers such as multiple myeloma and leukemia, in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. From a single placental source, Anthrogenesis can produce multiple stem cell transplant units that exceed current adult dosing standards for use in bone marrow transplants. From the same placental source, Anthrogenesis recovers large quantities of very early-stage stem cells that appear to have many of the characteristics attributed to embryonic stem cells. Unlike the embryo, the placenta is a non-controversial source of stem cells. Through its commercial franchise, Celgene will provide stem cell transplant units to oncologists treating hematological cancers. "Placental stem cells have the potential to transform the way physicians treat serious diseases and the way novel therapies are developed," said John W. Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Celgene Corporation. "This strategic acquisition combines the proprietary technology of Anthrogenesis with our commercial and development expertise to realize the substantial commercial and therapeutic potential of placental stem cells." Summary of Financial Terms Under the terms of the agreement first announced in November, Celgene will acquire all Anthrogenesis outstanding shares in a tax-free, stock-for-stock merger that will be accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. Based on an exchange ratio of .4545, Celgene will issue 1.45 million common shares. Celgene will also issue 1.3 million options and warrants at the same exchange ratio. The acquisition was completed on December 31, 2002 and will be accounted for in the fourth quarter of 2002. Celgene expects the merger with Anthrogenesis to be $0.05 to $0.10 dilutive to earnings in 2003, $0.05 to $0.10 accretive in 2004, and to have a positive impact on earnings thereafter. 7
