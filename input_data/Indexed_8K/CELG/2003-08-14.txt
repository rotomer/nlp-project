ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS. On August 13, 2003, Celgene Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to its Rights Agreement, dated as of September 16, 1996, as amended, between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement"), to create an exception to the definition of "Acquiring Person" to permit a qualified institutional investor to beneficially own 15% or more but less than 17% of the Company's common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock") then outstanding without being deemed an Acquiring Person if such institutional investor meets the following requirements: (i) such institutional investor is described in Rule 13d-1(b)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is eligible to report (and does in fact report) beneficial ownership of Common Stock on Schedule 13G; (2) such institutional investor is principally engaged in the business of managing investment funds for unaffiliated securities investors having an aggregate value of at least $10 billion; (3) such institutional investor is not required to file a Schedule 13D (or any comparable or successor report) which Schedule 13D would state a present intention to hold such Common Stock with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the Company, or in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect; and (4) such institutional investor does not beneficially own 17% or more of the Common Stock then outstanding (other than as a result of a Permitted Offer as defined in the Rights Agreement). Under the terms of the Rights Agreement, a "Person" (other than the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or any person or entity holding Common Stock for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan) who does not meet the aforementioned exception is deemed an Acquiring Person if such Person is the beneficial owner of 15% or more of Common Stock (other than as a result of a Permitted Offer). A copy of the Amendment is set forth as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein. The foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment. ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS.

EXHIBIT 4.1 AMENDMENT NUMBER TWO TO THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT DATED AS OF SEPTEMBER 16, 1996 BETWEEN CELGENE CORPORATION AND AMERICAN STOCK TRANSFER & TRUST COMPANY, AS RIGHTS AGENT Reference is made to the Rights Agreement dated as of September 16, 1996 between Celgene Corporation (the "Corporation") and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Rights Agent, as thereafter amended (the "Rights Agreement"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Rights Agreement. 1. Section 1 of the Rights Agreement is hereby amended to include the following new definition in the appropriate alphabetical position, with the subsequent definitions being appropriately re-lettered and cross-references thereto being appropriately revised: "Institutional Investor" shall mean, as of any time of determination, a Person that is described in Rule 13d-1(b)(1) promulgated under the Exchange Act (as such rule is in effect on the date hereof) and that is principally engaged in the business of managing investment funds for unaffiliated securities investors having an aggregate value of at least $10 billion. 2. Section 1(a) of the Rights Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and restated to read as follows: (a) "Acquiring Person" shall mean any Person who or that, together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, shall be the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the then outstanding Common Shares (other than as a result of a Permitted Offer (as hereinafter defined)) or was such a Beneficial Owner at any time after the date hereof, whether or not such Person continues to be the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the then outstanding Common Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the term "Acquiring Person" shall not include (i) the Corporation, (ii) any Subsidiary of the Corporation, (iii) any employee benefit plan of the Corporation or of any Subsidiary of the Corporation, (iv) any Person or entity organized, appointed or established by the Corporation for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan, or (v) any Person that is an Institutional Investor, but only so long as (1) such Institutional Investor shall be the Beneficial Owner of less than 17% of the then outstanding Common Shares (other than as a result of a Permitted Offer) and (2) such Institutional Investor is eligible to report (and does in fact report) such ownership on Schedule 13G under the Exchange Act, and is not required to file a Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act (or any comparable or successor report) which Schedule 13D would state a present intention to hold such Common Shares with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the Corporation, or in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect, and (B) no Person shall become an "Acquiring Person": (i) as a result of the acquisition of Common Shares by the Corporation which, by reducing the number of Common Shares outstanding , increases the proportional number of shares beneficially owned by such Person together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person; provided that if (1) a Person would be or become an Acquiring Person (but for
the operation of this subclause (i)) as a result of the acquisition of Common Shares by the Corporation, and (2) after such share acquisition by the Corporation, such Person, or an Affiliate or Associate of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of any additional Common Shares, then such Person shall be deemed an Acquiring Person; or (ii) if the Board of Directors determines in good faith that a Person who would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person" has become such inadvertently, and such Person (1) does not attempt to exercise any control over the business affairs or management of the Corporation, including by means of a proxy solicitation, and (2) divests as promptly as practicable a sufficient number of Common Shares so that such Person would no longer be an "Acquiring Person," then such Person shall not be deemed an "Acquiring Person" for any purposes of this Agreement.
