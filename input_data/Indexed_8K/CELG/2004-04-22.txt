Total revenue for the first quarter increased more than 68.8% to $82.9 million from $49.1 million for the prior-year quarter. THALOMID net sales in the first quarter of 2004 increased 51.7% to $69.2 million from $45.6 million in the first quarter of 2003.

Sequentially, total revenue increased 2.6% to $82.9 million in the first quarter from $80.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, with THALOMID(TM) sales rising approximately 5.5% quarter-over-quarter to $69.2 million from $65.6 million. During the quarter, Celgene invested more than 45 percent of total revenues into accelerating R&D spending with the immediate focus on the approval and commercialization of our lead investigational drug REVLIMID(TM). The increased investments in R&D advanced ongoing pivotal REVLIMID Phase III Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) trials for multiple myeloma and malignant metastatic melanoma, and continued to accelerate key regulatory programs for REVLIMID in myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma. Celgene spent $37.7 million in R&D programs during the first quarter of 2004 representing an increase of 52.6% compared to the year ago quarter. These R&D expenditures support rapid clinical progress in multiple development core programs including; THALOMID, REVLIMID, ACTIMID(TM), and our newest IMiD(TM) CC-11006, as well as other high potential investigational compounds including; SelCID(TM), kinase, benzopyran, ligase, tubulin inhibitors and stem cell programs. Celgene reported $695.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase from $667 million reported at year-end. "Celgene delivered growing profitability, strong product performance and significant progress across all key regulatory programs this quarter, a reflection of the extraordinary efforts of our people," said John W. Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Celgene Corporation. "We will continue to accelerate our investments in R&D that are essential to our future success. We look forward to an eventful year with meaningful milestones including; regulatory announcements, key presentations and publications reporting new clinical data on our lead products at major medical meetings, as well as further advancement of our rich product pipeline."

Additionally, we are increasing our target for 2004 total revenue to be in the range of $365 to $385 million from our initial target of $360 to $380 million. THALOMID revenue guidance has been increased to a range of $285-295 million from our prior guidance of $280-290 million.
