The DMC yesterday afternoon reviewed the unblinded interim results of our Phase III monotherapy REVLIMID melanoma trials and has determined that the trials would not demonstrate a statistically significant treatment effect and therefore recommended based on stopping rules that we halt the trials. We have accepted this recommendation and following formal notification and review of the analysis, physicians and patients will be advised of this information. The results of this later stage monotherapy trial do not effect our development plan or timelines for other indications such as myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloma and other solid tumors for which this agent is being or planned to be investigated, these include; prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer and renal cell carcinoma. We are also planning combination trials in melanoma. Importantly this drug was generally well tolerated in these advanced cancer patients.
