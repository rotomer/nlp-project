The Vendors shall have no greater liability to an assignee of the Purchaser under, or in respect of a breach of, this Agreement than they would have had to the Purchaser under the Agreement in respect of such breach if the assignment had not been made. In this respect it is acknowledged by the Vendors that, in the event that the Purchaser either assigns this Agreement, in whole or in part, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, or directs that Shares be transferred directly to such third parties (pursuant to paragraph 1.1.1 of Schedule 2), the Purchaser may receive payment in respect of such assignment or transfer, which payment may be greater than or less than the appropriate proportion of the Purchase Price.

accordance with English law, and any right any Party might otherwise have to rely upon the law of the forum or any other law is hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waived. 10.2 Submission to jurisdiction -------------------------- 10.2.1 Each Party submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales in relation to all claims, disputes, differences or other matters arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. 10.2.2 Each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have: (a) to object on any ground to an action being brought in the Courts of England and Wales, to claim that the action brought in the Courts of England and Wales has been brought in an inconvenient forum, or to claim that the Courts of England and Wales do not have jurisdiction. The waiver contained in this clause 10.2.2(a) includes (without limitation) a waiver of all formal and substantive requirements of any otherwise competent jurisdiction in relation to this clause 10.2.2(a); (b) to oppose the enforcement of any judgment of any court of England and Wales whether on any ground referred to in clause 10.2.2(a) or otherwise. 10.3 Service of process ------------------ 10.3.1 Each Party agrees that, without prejudice to the validity of any other mode of service, any document in an action (including, but not limited to, any claim form, application notice or other originating process) may be served on any party by being delivered to or left for that party at its address for service of notices under clause 9.4. 10.3.2 Notwithstanding and without prejudice to the foregoing the Purchaser and the Guarantor appoint the Purchaser's Solicitors as its agent to receive service of process in respect of any proceedings commenced in the Courts of England and Wales arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. 10.3.3 Without prejudice to the effectiveness of service pursuant to any other method recognised by the Rules of Civil Procedure, service of such process upon the Purchaser's Solicitors at their address given in this Agreement or elsewhere within the jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales pursuant to the Rules of Civil Procedure for the time being in force shall constitute good service on the Purchaser. The Purchaser and the Guarantor undertake not to contest in any court in any jurisdiction the enforcement in that jurisdiction of any judgment of the Courts of England and Wales against it on the ground that the Courts of England and Wales did not have jurisdiction over it or that service of process (being service in accordance with this clause) was invalid or ineffective or resulted in it not having due or adequate notice of the proceedings. 25

4 OVER-PROVISIONS AND RELIEFS 4.1 The Purchaser shall at the request of the Warrantors (or the Vendors Representative on behalf of the Warrantors) require the Auditors to determine (as experts and not as arbitrators and at the expense of the Warrantors) whether: 4.1.1 any provision for Taxation in the Completion Accounts has proved to be an over-provision and if so its amount; 4.1.2 any right to a repayment of Taxation treated as an asset in the Completion Accounts has proved to be understated and if so its amount or, where no right to repayment of Taxation was treated as an asset in the Completion Accounts, whether any such amount should have been treated as an asset in the Completion Accounts the Closing Balance Sheet and if so the amount; or 4.1.3 any Actual Taxation Liability which arises or would otherwise have arisen (other than one which would otherwise have given rise to a corresponding liability of the Warrantors under paragraph 1 of part 2) is avoided or reduced or any repayment of an amount of Taxation is obtained in either case by the use of a Vendor's Relief, and, if so, the amount of Taxation so saved or the amount of that repayment; and if the Auditors determine that there has proved to be any such over-provision, understatement or amount, the amount of such over-provision, understatement or amount (as the case may be) shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 4.3. 4.2 The Purchaser shall at the request of the Warrantors (or the Vendors' Representative on behalf of the Warrantors) require the Auditors to determine (as experts and not as arbitrators and at the expense of the Warrantors) whether any Taxation Liability (or the Event giving rise to such Taxation Liability or the discharge of it) which has resulted in any sum having been paid or becoming payable by the Warrantors under part 2 or for breach of any Taxation Warranty has given rise to a Relief (or would give rise to a Relief assuming that all reasonable steps are taken to obtain such Relief) which would not otherwise have arisen, and: 4.2.1 a liability of the Company to make an actual payment or increased payment of Taxation has been satisfied or avoided in whole or in part by the use of that Relief; or 4.2.2 a right to a repayment of Taxation has arisen as a result of the use of that Relief; and, if the Auditors so determine, the amount by which that liability has been satisfied or avoided or an amount equal to the amount of that repayment (as the case may be) shall be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 4.3 (for the avoidance of doubt this shall not avoid the Warrantors making a payment in respect of any Taxation Liability if the determination by the Auditors has not been completed or the Relief as so determined by the Auditors is not available 40
by the time of the due date for payment by the Warrantors under part 2 in respect of such Taxation Liability). 4.3 Where it is provided under paragraph 4.1 or 4.2 that any amount is to be dealt with in accordance with this paragraph 4.3: 4.3.1 the amount shall first be set off against any payment then due from the Warrantors under part 2 or for breach of any Taxation Warranty; 4.3.2 to the extent there is an excess, a refund shall be made to the Warrantors, within 5 business days of the auditor's determination referred to in paragraph 4.1, of any previous payment made by the Warrantors under part 2 or for breach of any Taxation Warranty and not previously refunded under this clause up to the amount of such excess; and 4.3.3 to the extent that the excess referred to in paragraph 4.3.1 is not exhausted thereunder, the remainder of that excess shall be carried forward and set off against any future payment which becomes due from the Warrantors under part 2 or for breach of any Taxation Warranty. 4.4 Where such determination by the Auditors as is mentioned in paragraph 4.1 or 4.2 has been made, the Warrantors (or the Vendors' Representative on behalf of the Warrantors) or the Purchaser may request the Auditors to review such determination (at the expense of the person making the request) in the light of all relevant circumstances, including any facts which have become known only since such determination, and to determine whether such determination remains correct or whether, in the light of those circumstances, the amount that was the subject of such determination should be amended. 4.5 If the Auditors determine under paragraph 4.4 that an amount previously determined should be amended, that amended amount shall be substituted for the purposes of paragraph 4.1 or 4.2, as the case may be, in place of the amount originally determined and such adjusting payment (if any) as may be required by virtue of such substitution shall forthwith be made by the Warrantors to the Purchaser or, as the case may be, by the Purchaser to the Warrantors. 5 RECOVERY FROM THIRD PARTIES If, in the event of any payment becoming due from the Warrantors under part 2 or for breach of any Taxation Warranty and the Company either is immediately entitled at the due date for the making of that payment to recover from some other person any sum in respect of the Taxation Liability that has resulted in that payment becoming due from the Warrantors, or at some subsequent date becomes entitled to make such a recovery, then the Purchaser shall procure that the Company shall (in either of those cases) but without prejudice to the Warrantors' obligations to make payment under part 2 or for breach of any Taxation Warranties on the due date, promptly notify the Warrantors of its entitlement and the Purchaser shall procure, if so required by the Warrantors, (provided the Warrantors shall first indemnify the Company to the Purchaser's reasonable satisfaction against all losses, damages, reasonable costs and expenses which may be incurred by the Company) that the Company takes such 41
reasonable steps as the Warrantors shall reasonably request to enforce that recovery (keeping the Warrantors informed of the progress of any action taken) and shall account to the Warrantors for so much of any sum so recovered (less (a) any Tax payable by the Company thereon, and (b) all reasonable charges, costs and expenses incurred by the Company in recovering such sum) as does not exceed the amount which the Warrantors have paid or that is due to be paid by the Warrantors under this Deed). 6 APPEALS AND CONDUCT OF CLAIMS 6.1 If the Purchaser or the Company (or any of their officers, employees, servants or agents) becomes aware of a Claim, the Purchaser shall or shall procure that the Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable give written notice of the Claim to the Warrantors and, in any event, where a statutory or other time limit is applicable for responding to or appealing against the Claim or to any assessment, notice, demand or other document issued (or deemed to be issued) or action taken which constitutes the Claim, the Purchaser shall give written notice of the Claim to the Warrantors at least 14 days prior to the expiry of such time limit. To the extent reasonably possible, having regard to the information and time available, such written notice shall include an estimate of the Warrantors' liability under this schedule in respect of such Claim, the basis of calculation of that estimate and such details of the Claim as are then available to the Purchaser or the Company. 6.2 The Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the Company shall, take such action to appeal, protest against, mitigate, reduce, avoid, dispute, resist or compromise the Claim and make available such documents, information and assistance in connection with the Claim as the Warrantors (or the Vendors' Representatives on behalf of the Warrantors) may by written notice request provided the Warrantors shall indemnify the Purchaser and the Company to their reasonable satisfaction against reasonable costs and expenses and any fines, penalties, surcharges, interest or additional Taxation which the Purchaser or the Company incurs as a result of taking such action or providing such information and assistance. 6.3 The Warrantors (or the Vendors' Representatives on behalf of the Warrantors) may, if the Warrantors (or the Vendors' Representatives on behalf of Warrantors) request in writing and the Purchaser consents (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such request, elect to have any action referred to in paragraph 6.2 conducted by professional advisers acting in the name of the Company but reporting to, and taking instructions from, the Warrantors (or the Vendors' Representatives on behalf of the Warrantors) in which event the provisions of paragraph 6.4 shall apply. 6.4 The Warrantors hereby undertake to the Purchaser to: 6.4.1 keep the Purchaser informed of all matters relating to the action and deliver to the Purchaser copies of all material correspondence relating to the action; 6.4.2 obtain the prior written approval of the Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to the content and sending of written communications relating to the action to a Taxation Authority; and 42
6.4.3 obtain the prior written approval of the Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to: (a) the settlement or compromise of the Claim which is the subject of the action; and (b) the agreement of any matter in the conduct of the action which is likely to affect the amount of the Claim. 6.5 The Purchaser shall not be obliged to procure that the Company take any action under this clause which involves contesting a Claim before any appellate tribunal or court unless the Warrantors furnish the Purchaser with the written opinion of Counsel of at least ten years call approved by the Purchaser (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) who is experienced in the subject matter of the Claim to the effect that an appeal in respect of the matter in question has a reasonable prospect of being won. 6.6 If at any time the Warrantors request that the Purchaser take, or procure that the Company take, any action referred to in paragraph 6.2, but do not make any request referred to in paragraph 6.3 (or the Purchaser does not consent to any such request), the provisions of paragraph 6.4 shall apply as if references to "the Warrantors" are references to "the Purchaser" and reference to "the Purchaser" are references to "the Warrantors". 7 DISPUTES 7.1 In the event of any dispute under paragraph 3, 4, 5, 6 or 8 of this schedule, such dispute shall if the Parties so agree be determined by the Independent Expert (acting as expert and not as arbitrator) and in the absence of manifest error his determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties.

SCHEDULE 6 The Completion Accounts ----------------------- 1 The first draft of the Completion Accounts shall be prepared by Penn and the Company at the direction of the Vendors' Representatives on behalf of the Vendors as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within 15 Business Days of Completion. The Purchaser shall ensure that the Vendors Representatives and the Vendors' Accountants are allowed all reasonable access to all relevant information, personnel and records of, or under the control of, the Company solely for that purpose and the Vendors shall not be in breach of their obligations pursuant to this Schedule to the extent the Purchaser fails to ensure the same. 2 The Purchaser's Accountants shall, on the Completion Date, carry out a full physical stock-take in respect of the stock of the Company as at the Completion Date. 3 The Vendors shall instruct: 3.1 the Vendors' Accountants to audit the profit and loss account and the Closing Balance Sheet (which form part of the Completion Accounts) as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any event within 15 Business Days of the provision of first draft of the Completion Accounts pursuant to paragraph 1); and 3.2 no later than 5 Business Days after completion of such audit the Vendors' Representatives to prepare a statement ("THE STATEMENT") setting out, in their opinion, the Closing Net Financial Position, the Closing Debt and the Purchase Price and deliver a copy of the Statement and the Completion Accounts to the Purchaser and the Purchaser's Solicitors as soon as practicable thereafter. 4 The Completion Accounts shall be prepared: 4.1 in accordance with bases, policies, principles and procedures consistent with those employed in the worked example set out in annexure 1 to this Agreement; and 4.2 in the event that bases, policies, principles, practices and procedures set out in annexure 1 to this Agreement do not specify the treatment to be applied in relation to a particular item, then in accordance with appropriate accounting bases, policies, principles, practices and procedures generally accepted in the United Kingdom. 5 The Purchaser shall review the Statement and the Completion Accounts following delivery of the same by the Vendors' Representatives pursuant to paragraph 3 and shall, within 20 Business Days of such delivery, deliver to the Vendors' Representatives a letter ("THE LETTER") specifying any disputes or differences they may have in connection with the Statement or the Completion Accounts, failing which (or if the Purchaser confirms in writing to the Vendors' 80
Representatives that it proposes no adjustments to the Statement or Completion Accounts) the Statement and the Completion Accounts shall be final and binding. 6 The Vendors shall ensure that the Purchaser and the Purchaser's Accountants are allowed all reasonable access to all relevant information, personnel and records (including (provided the Purchaser and the Purchaser's Accountants agree to such terms in connection therewith as the Vendors' Accountants may reasonably require) all access to the working papers of the Vendors' Accountants relating to the preparation of the profit and loss account and the Closing Balance Sheet (which form part of the Completion Accounts) and relating to the preparation of the Statement and (to the extent required) all relevant information, personnel and records of, or under the control of Penn or any member of Penn Group) for the purposes of their review of the Statement. 7 The Vendors jointly on the one part and the Purchaser on the other shall each use their reasonable endeavours to resolve any disputes or differences that may be specified in the Letter in connection with the Statement or any matter stated in it within 15 Business Days following the delivery of the Letter. If the Vendors and the Purchaser agree on the adjustments to be made to the Statement and/or the Completion Accounts they shall jointly incorporate such adjustments into the Statement and the Completion Accounts and the Statement and the Completion Accounts shall be final and binding. Failing resolution of the same within such period (or longer period as the Purchaser and the Vendors' Representatives may agree in writing) any such disputes or differences shall forthwith be referred to the decision of the Independent Accountant and so that: 7.1 the Independent Accountant shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator in connection with the giving of a determination; 7.2 each determination of the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding on the Parties (save in the case of manifest error) and shall be notified to the Parties by means of a written determination of the Independent Accountant; and 7.3 the Statement and the Completion Accounts as so determined by the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding. 8 In the event that an Independent Accountant is so appointed, the Vendors jointly on the one part and the Purchaser on the other, shall be entitled to make such written submissions to the Independent Accountant as they shall respectively think fit during such period for making such submissions as the Independent Accountant shall determine (but which period shall be no longer than 10 Business Days from appointment of the Independent Accountant). 9 Each of the Vendors and the Purchaser will promptly provide to the Independent Accountant all such information and documentation as the Independent Accountant may reasonably require. 10 The Independent Accountant shall have the right to such professional assistance and advice as the Independent Accountant may reasonably require. 81
11 The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant and other professional fees incurred by the Independent Accountant shall be apportioned between the Vendors on the one part and the Purchaser on the other, as the Independent Accountant shall see fit in his determination. 82

(a) any matter provided for or contemplated in each case (specifically and expressly) by the terms of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; (b) any voluntary act, omission, transaction or arrangement of the Purchaser or the Purchaser's Group at any time or of the Company after Completion or any of their respective officers, agents or successors in title (to the extent only that the Purchaser was aware that such change would give rise to a Warranty Claim); (c) any matter specifically provided for in the Latest Accounts or any previous accounts of the Company; (d) any matter taken into account in the determination of the Purchase Price or the preparation of the Completion Accounts in each case in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; (e) any asset acquired by the Company after Completion; (f) the disposal by the Company of any asset after Completion; (g) the passing of a resolution for the winding up of the Company after Completion; (h) any change in the nature of the business of the Company (or in the manner of conducting it) after Completion (to the extent only that the Purchaser was aware that such change would give rise to a Warranty Claim); (i) any statutory provision not in force at the date of Completion or any change in any statutory provision after the date of Completion or any decision of the Courts after the date of this Completion altering the accepted interpretation of any statutory provision; (j) any departure from the format, matter, bases, priorities and principles used in the preparation of the audited accounts of the Company after Completion; or (k) any change on or after Completion of the accounting reference date of the Company; 6.2.3 the Warranty Claim arises in connection with any matter or thing done or omitted prior to Completion by the Company at the written request of or with the prior written approval of any member of the Purchaser's Group or their representatives or professional advisers; 6.2.4 the loss or liability to which such Warranty Claim relates has been or is made good or otherwise compensated for at no expense to the Company, the Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Group; or 85
6.2.6 the loss or liability suffered or incurred by the Purchaser to which the Warranty Claim relates is contingent, future or unascertainable and no Warranty Claim may be brought in respect of such loss or liability until such time as the Purchaser shall have actually suffered the loss or incurred the liability in question. 7 SUBSEQUENT RECOVERY FROM THIRD PARTY 7.1 The Purchaser shall reimburse to each Warrantor forthwith an amount equal to any sum paid by him in respect of any Warranty Claim which is subsequently recovered by or paid to the Purchaser or any other member of the Purchaser's Group by any other person in respect of the matter giving rise to the Claim (less any Expenses incurred in making such recovery and any Taxation thereon (if any)). 7.2 Any amount paid by the Purchaser pursuant to paragraphs 4.3 or 7.1 or Part 1 of schedule 3 shall be taken into account, with retrospective effect, in ascertaining whether the amounts in paragraph 4.1 above are exceeded.

Thereafter any Warranty Claim shall be limited (in addition to the limitations on the liability of the Warrantors referred to in this schedule 7) to the amount by which the loss or damage suffered by the Purchaser as a result of such breach shall exceed the amount (if any) so recovered. 86

SCHEDULE 8 Rights of First Refusal and Last Refusal ---------------------------------------- 1 The provisions of this schedule 8 shall only apply in the event of a Relevant Transaction and not otherwise and shall following a CR Disposal terminate and be of no further effect in relation to Craig Rennie and shall following an LI Disposal terminate and be of no further effect in relation to the Lead Investor and shall following an Asset Sale terminate and be of no further effect. 2 Subject to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this schedule 8 (which shall for the avoidance of doubt prevail), in the event that any person wishes to effect a Relevant Transaction then: 2.1 if the Relevant Transaction results from an Unsolicited Offer being received from a Third Party, the provisions of paragraphs 6 to 11 inclusive of this schedule 8 shall apply; or 2.2 if the Relevant Transaction does not result from such an Unsolicited Offer, then the board of directors of Penn (the "PENN BOARD") shall serve on the Purchaser a transfer notice in respect of the Offered Shares or Offered Assets, as the case may be, in accordance with paragraph 3 of this schedule 8 (a "TRANSFER NOTICE"). 3 A Transfer Notice served by the Penn Board in accordance with paragraph 2.2 above shall: 3.1 state the number of Offered Shares or, in the case of an Asset Sale, describe in reasonable detail the Offered Assets; 3.2 (to the extent possible without breaching the terms of any confidentiality agreement to which Penn, any member of the Penn Group or any shareholder of Penn is party) state the full name and address of the proposed offeree (if any); 3.3 state the terms (including as to price, type of consideration and any restrictions on the receipt of cash (or its equivalent) consideration, if any) upon which the Offeror wishes to effect the Relevant Transaction or, if an offer has been received which, if accepted, would result in a Relevant Transaction, the terms of such offer (the "OFFER TERMS"); and 3.4 invite the Purchaser to make an offer to acquire all of the Offered Shares or Offered Assets, as the case may be, upon terms that are no less favourable than the Offer Terms within 14 days of the date of the Transfer Notice (the "FIRST REFUSAL PERIOD"). 4 If, within the First Refusal Period, the Purchaser makes no response to the Transfer Notice or confirms that it does not wish to make an offer for the Offered Shares or Offered Assets, as the case may be, on the Offer Terms at that time or makes an offer for the Offered Shares or Offered Assets on terms that are less favourable than the Offer Terms, then the Penn Board may offer for sale and transfer the Offered Shares or Offered Assets at any time within the next six 89
months to a third party purchaser on any terms (including as to price) provided that these are no less favourable than the Offer Terms. If no third party offer for the Offered Shares or Offered Assets is received within the said six month period, then the provisions of paragraph 2 shall apply. 5 If, within the First Refusal Period, the Purchaser makes an offer for the Offered Shares or Offered Assets, as the case may be, on terms which, taken as a whole (including as to price, type of consideration and any restrictions on the receipt of cash (or its equivalent) consideration), are no less favourable than the Offer Terms (the "FIRST REFUSAL OFFER"), then the Offeror shall accept the First Refusal Offer and the provisions of paragraph 11 shall apply. 6 If an Unsolicited Offer is received by an Offferor from a third party purchaser (the "THIRD PARTY PURCHASER") which the Offeror is minded to accept, then the Offeror shall, prior to completion of the Relevant Transaction, serve on the Purchaser a notice in writing of the Third Party Purchaser's offer (the "THIRD PARTY OFFER NOTICE"). 7 The Third Party Offer Notice shall: 7.1 state the number of Offered Shares or, in the case of an Asset Sale, describe in reasonable detail the Offered Assets; 7.2 (to the extent possible without breaching the terms of any confidentiality agreement to which Penn, any member of the Penn Group or any shareholder of Penn is party) state the full name and address of the Third Party Purchaser; and 7.3 invite the Purchaser to make an offer to acquire all of the Offered Shares or Offered Assets, as the case may be, within 14 days of the date of receipt by the Purchaser of the confidentiality undertaking referred to in paragraph 8 below or, if the Purchaser does not enter into such a confidentiality undertaking, within 14 days of the date of the Third Party Offer Notice (the "LAST REFUSAL PERIOD"). 8 Craig Rennie shall procure, or shall procure that Penn shall procure, that a confidentiality undertaking executed by the Third Party Purchaser in a form that is in all material respects no more onerous than that agreed between the Offeror and the Third Party Purchaser and which expressly permits the Offeror to disclose the terms (including as to price, type of consideration and any restrictions on the receipt of cash (or its equivalent) consideration, if any) of the Unsolicited Offer (the "THIRD PARTY OFFER TERMS") is delivered to the Purchaser as soon as practicable following delivery of the Third Party Offer Notice. Within 24 hours of the Purchaser executing such confidentiality undertaking, the Offeror shall notify the Purchaser of the terms (including as to price, type of consideration and any restrictions on the receipt of cash (or its equivalent) consideration, if any) of the Unsolicited Offer (the "THIRD PARTY OFFER TERMS"). 9 If, within the Last Refusal Period, the Purchaser makes no response to the Third Party Offer Notice or confirms that it does not wish to make an offer for the Offered Shares or Offered Assets, as the case may be, at that time or makes an offer for the 90
Offered Shares or Offered Assets on terms that are less favourable than the Third Party Offer Terms, then the Offeror may offer for sale and transfer the Offered Shares or Offered Assets at any time within the next six months to the Third Party Purchaser on terms including as to price that in all material respects are no less favourable than the Third Party Offer Terms. 10 If, within the Last Refusal Period, the Purchaser makes an offer for the Offered Shares or Offered Assets, as the case may be, on terms which, taken as a whole (including as to price, type of consideration and any restrictions on the receipt of cash (or its equivalent) consideration), are no less favourable than the Third Party Offer Terms (the "LAST REFUSAL OFFER"), then the Offeror shall accept the Last Refusal Offer and the provisions of paragraph 11 shall apply. 11 If the Offeror notifies the Purchaser that it accepts either the First Refusal Offer or the Last Refusal Offer (as the case may be), then the Offeror shall be bound to sell and the Purchaser shall be bound to purchase all of the Offered Shares or Offered Assets, as the case may be, within 14 days of the date of the notice of acceptance (or such longer period as the Offeror and the Purchaser shall agree in writing). Between the date of the notice of acceptance and the expiry of the 14 day period, the Offeror shall permit the Purchase to undertake a reasonable due diligence exercise and the Purchaser and the Offeror shall negotiate in good faith to agree the terms of the transaction including, without limitation, the extent of the warranties and indemnities to be given by the Offeror; provided always that: (a) in no circumstances shall either the Lead Investor of its Permitted Transferees be required to give any warranties or indemnities (other than warranties in relation to title to shares and capacity) and (b) in no circumstances shall the Offeror be required to give any warranties or accept any liability to the extent that the same is greater than that required by the Third Party Purchaser. The Purchaser shall be responsible for payment of any stamp duties on any sale of Offered Shares to it pursuant to this schedule 8. If the terms of the transaction are not agreed within such 14 day period referred to above (or such longer period as the Offeror and the Purchaser shall agree in writing), then the provisions of clause 4 or 9 shall apply as if the Purchaser had made no response to the Transfer Notice or Third Party Offer Notice (whichever is applicable). 12 If the Articles are amended or replaced and at the relevant time it is possible under the terms of this schedule that one or more Relevant Transactions could take place, the Vendors shall procure that the amended or replacement Articles include provisions on the same, or substantially the same, terms as those set out at Article 6.6 of the Articles. 13 The Vendors shall use their reasonable endeavours to ensure that any confidentiality agreement entered into by Penn, any member of the Penn Group or any shareholder of Penn does not operate to prevent the full name and address of any Third Party Purchaser being disclosed to the Purchaser in accordance with paragraphs 3.2 and 7.2. 14 In this Schedule, unless the context otherwise requires: 91
