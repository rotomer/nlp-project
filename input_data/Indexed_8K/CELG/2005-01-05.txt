CELGENE UK MANUFACTURING II LIMITED (FORMERLY PENN T LIMITED) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDED 31 MARCH 2004 F-1
REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CELGENE UK MANUFACTURING II LIMITED We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Celgene UK Manufacturing II Limited (the "Division") as at 31 March 2004 and 2003 and the related profit and loss accounts, and cash flow statements for each of the years in the two-year period ended 31 March 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of Celgene UK Manufacturing II Limited management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Division as at 31 March 2004 and 2003, the results of its operations and its cash flows, for each of the years in the two-year period ended 31 March 2004, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom vary in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Information relating to the nature and effect of such differences is presented in note 23 to the financial statements. KPMG LLP CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTS BRISTOL, UNITED KINGDOM 22 DECEMBER 2004 F-2

CELGENE UK MANUFACTURING II LIMITED (FORMERLY PENN T LIMITED) CASH FLOW STATEMENT FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDED 31 MARCH 2004 F-5
CELGENE UK MANUFACTURING II LIMITED (FORMERLY PENN T LIMITED) ACCOUNTING POLICIES The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom. A summary of the more important accounting policies is set out below. BASIS OF PREPARATION These Celgene UK Manufacturing II Limited financial statements have been prepared under generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom ("UK GAAP"). A reconciliation has been prepared and included within these financial statements to show the effect of the differences between UK GAAP and generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("US GAAP"). The information set out in these accounts does not constitute the company's statutory accounts for the two years ended 31 March 2004. Those accounts have been reported on by the company's auditors; their reports were unqualified and did not contain a statement under section 237(2) or (3) of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985. The accounts for the two years ended 31 March 2004 have been delivered to the United Kingdom registrar of companies. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention. TURNOVER Turnover is recorded on the sale of goods at the point of which the possession of title passes. Royalty income is recorded on a receivable basis in accordance with sales reported by the licensee. STOCKS Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. Cost is determined on a first-in first-out basis. The cost of work in progress comprises materials, direct labour and attributable production overheads. Net realisable value is based on the estimated sales price after allowing for all further costs of completion and disposal. Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective stocks. DEFERRED TAXATION Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. A net deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and/or from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis. GOODWILL Goodwill arising on acquisition represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill arising on acquisition is eliminated by amortisation through the profit and loss account over its useful economic life, which the directors estimate to be 20 years. F-6

CELGENE UK MANUFACTURING II LIMITED (FORMERLY PENN T LIMITED) NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE TWO YEARS ENDED 31 MARCH 2004 23 SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UK AND US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The financial statements are prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, which differs in certain respects from US GAAP. Differences which have an effect on the profit and loss account and balance sheet are set out below: Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisition and representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is amortised through the profit and loss account over its useful economic life. Under US GAAP the transaction to set up the company was a transaction among entities under common control and assets and liabilities are reported at the historical cost of the transferor. The company was created as the result of a demerger of a business previously controlled by an associated company. Therefore, the assets are reported at historical cost for US GAAP purposes and goodwill would not be recorded. F-18
CELGENE CORPORATION INTRODUCTION TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) On October 21, 2004, Celgene Corporation, through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired all of the outstanding shares of Penn T Limited ("Penn T"), from a consortium of private investors (the "Acquisition") for approximately $114.6 million, including estimated acquisition related costs of approximately $2.3 million and estimated working capital adjustments of approximately $3.2 million, which are expected to be paid upon final completion and agreement of the net working capital amounts. The Company did not assume existing debt (consisting of a bank loan and related party debt) of approximately $14.2 million, which was retained by the existing shareholders. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2004 gives effect to the Acquisition as if the Acquisition occurred on that date. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and for the year ended December 31, 2003, combine the historical consolidated statements of operations of the Company and Penn T, giving effect to the acquisition of Penn T as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2003. The Company made pro forma adjustments to the historical consolidated financial information to give effect to events that are (i) directly attributable to the acquisition, (ii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results, and (iii) factually supportable. The fiscal year end of Penn T is March 31, whereas the fiscal year end of the Company is December 31. The pro forma condensed unaudited statement of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 is derived from Penn T's statement of operations for the year ended March 31, 2004 and the Company's statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. The pro forma condensed unaudited statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 is derived from Penn T's Unaudited statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and the Company's unaudited statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred if the Acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2003 and should not be construed as being representative of future operating results or financial position. The unaudited pro forma condensed financial information should be read in conjunction with the: o Accompanying Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Financial Information; o Company's historical consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003; o Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2004, and the quarterly period ended June 30, 2004; and o Celgene UK Manufacturing II, Limited (formerly Penn T Limited) historical financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 (included in this 8-K/A filing).

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION Penn T's fiscal year ends on March 31. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes Penn T's results for their fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Statement of Operations for the nine-months ended September 30, 2004 includes Penn T's results for the same nine-months. Penn T's results for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 were included in both Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Statement of Operations. For the quarter ended March 31, 2004, Penn T's revenue was approximately $4.2 million and net income was approximately $1.9 million. (A) Historical Penn T's financial statements are presented in British Pounds. The historical financial statements were converted to U.S. dollars using an exchange rate of 1GBP to $1.80 as of September 30, 2004, 1 GBP to $1.82 for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and 1 GBP to $1.69 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The Penn T financials have been reclassified to conform to Celgene's presentation. (B) Penn T financial statements have been prepared under UK generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These adjustments show the effect of the differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP. The primary difference relates to eliminating goodwill of approximately $17.6 million, which would not have been recognized under U.S. GAAP and eliminating the related amortization expense of approximately $0.8 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2004 and approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. (C) To eliminate approximately $8.9 million of current liabilities and approximately $6.1 million of long-term debt and related interest expense from historical Penn T liabilities that were not assumed in the acquisition. (D) To record the estimated purchase accounting effects as if the acquisition had occurred on either the pro forma balance sheet date or on January 1 of the appropriate pro forma statement of operations. The Company's preliminary estimate for the purchase price allocation is as follows (in thousands of $): Accounts receivable $5,891 Inventory 3,542 Intangibles: Amortizable intangibles 104,510 Goodwill 34,929 Accounts payable (453) Accrued expenses (acquisition related costs) (2,283) Accrued expenses (additional purchase price due to estimated working capital adjustment) (3,194) Other current liabilities (1,530) Deferred tax liabilities (32,318) -------- $109,094 ======== Amortizable intangibles include supply contracts. (E) To eliminate the historical Penn T stockholders' equity accounts. (F) To record amortization expense for the estimated intangible assets which will be recorded as a result of the Acquisition over their estimated useful life of 13 years based on the preliminary valuation report. (G) To eliminate inter-company sales and profit recognition on inter-company sales from Penn T to Celgene which have not yet been sold to an unrelated third party. (Prior to the acquisition the Company purchased product from Penn T under a supply agreement. Penn T also sold product to other unrelated third parties). (H) To pro forma the effects of interest income that may have been generated with the internal funds used to make the acquisition (I) To reflect tax impact of pro forma adjustments F-23
