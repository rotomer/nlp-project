SUMMIT, NJ - (JULY 28, 2005) - CELGENE CORPORATION (NASDAQ: CELG) announced adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.17 for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, driven by record product sales. On a reported basis, under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Celgene reported net income of $10.8 million, or earnings per diluted share of $0.06 in the second quarter of 2005 compared to net income of $2.6 million, or earnings of $0.02 per diluted share in the second quarter of the prior year. Total revenue for the second quarter, including a $20 million milestone payment for the NDA approval of FOCALIN XR(TM), increased 66.0% to $145.7 million from $87.7 million for the prior-year quarter. THALOMID(R) net sales in the second quarter of 2005 increased 26.6% to $94.4 million from $74.6 million in the second quarter of 2004. Celgene posted second quarter adjusted net income of $30.5 million, or adjusted earnings of $0.17 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of $12.4 million or adjusted earnings of $0.07 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. For the six-month period, total revenue reached a record $258.1 million, an increase of 51.3% over the same period in 2004. THALOMID sales for the six-month period were $182.8 million compared to $143.8 million in 2004, an increase of 27.2% year-over-year. Celgene posted adjusted net income of $49.6 million or adjusted earnings of $0.27 per diluted share, during the six-month period, compared to adjusted net income of $21.0 million or adjusted earnings of $0.12 per diluted share in the comparable 2004 period. During the six-month period on a reported basis, Celgene announced GAAP net income of $59.0 million or earnings of $0.32 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $11.5 million or earnings of $0.07 per diluted share in the first six-months of last year. Adjusted net income and per share amounts for the six-month period ended June 30, 2005, eliminate the effects of first and second quarter charges for accelerated depreciation expense related to the Company's corporate headquarters relocation. Adjusted net income and per share amounts for the six-month period ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, eliminate the effects of first and second quarter charges recorded for changes in the estimated value of the Company's investment in EntreMed, Inc. warrants, charges associated with the write-down of in-process research and development costs resulting from our purchase of EntreMed shares of common stock in connection with the exercise of our warrants and our subsequent share of equity losses in EntreMed. Adjusted net income and per share amounts for the six-month period ended June 30, 2005, also adjusts the income tax provision to a projected cash tax rate of 28 percent including the reversal of a tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2005 associated with the recognition of net deferred tax assets which were previously reserved. (Attached to the press release is a table that reconciles GAAP and adjusted amounts) Adjusted or Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis because certain unusual or non-recurring items that do not affect the Company's basic operations also do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual non-recurring items. Adjusted earnings are not, and should not be, viewed as a substitute for GAAP net income. Our definition of adjusted earnings may differ from others.
To support clinical development and to advance U.S. and European regulatory filings, Celgene increased R&D expenditures in REVLIMID(R) Phase II and Phase III regulatory programs in myelodysplastic syndromes, and pivotal Phase III SPA trials for multiple myeloma. Celgene incurred R&D expenses of $49.0 million in the second quarter of 2005, representing an increase of 26.9% compared to the year ago quarter. These R&D expenditures continue to support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs. As of June 30, 2005, Celgene reported $723.7 million in cash and marketable securities, an increase of $22 million versus the prior quarter. "We are very pleased with both the strong operating performance and the significant clinical and regulatory advances achieved with REVLIMID this quarter." said John W. Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Celgene Corporation. "These results position us to meet or exceed key operating and strategic objectives for the year." 2005 SECOND QUARTER COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS: CLINICAL AND REGULATORY ACHIEVEMENTS: o REVLIMID NDA was granted a Priority Review designation with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of October 7, 2005. Celgene is seeking approval to market REVLIMID as a targeted treatment for transfusion-dependent patients with low and intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with deletion 5q chromosomal abnormality. It is the expectation of the Company that the application will be reviewed at an Oncology Drug Advisory Committee meeting in September 2005. o FOCALIN XR(TM) was granted FDA approval for the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults, adolescents and children. The approval of FOCALIN XR for the treatment of ADHD was based on efficacy and safety data from clinical trials involving approximately 320 adults, adolescents and children diagnosed with ADHD. o At an ASCO Plenary Session, updated REVLIMID clinical data were presented from a Phase II multi-center trial (MDS-003) evaluating REVLIMID in the treatment of low and intermediate risk MDS patients with deletion 5q chromosomal abnormality. The study achieved its primary endpoint, and reported positive clinical results with 66% of transfusion-dependent MDS patients becoming transfusion independent with median hemoglobin increase of 5.3g/dl, on an intent-to-treat basis. The study also reported that myelosuppression is common and manageable with treatment interruption and dose adjustment. o At an ASCO Scientific Symposium, updated REVLIMID clinical data were presented from Pivotal Phase III Special Protocol Assessment trials using REVLIMID in the treatment of previously treated patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The studies showed overwhelmingly positive statistically significant difference in median TTP, the primary endpoint of the two trials. In both trials, side effects were well characterized and manageable; the combination of REVLIMID(R) and dexamethasone appeared to be well tolerated.
o At ASCO, clinical results were presented on REVLIMID as an innovative approach for treating patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Dr. Chanan-Khan of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York reported that twelve out of fourteen relapsed or refractory CLL patients responded to treatment with REVLIMID experiencing a median decrease of 61% in absolute lymphocyte count, a measure of tumor burden. One patient achieved complete response, two patients achieved partial response and nine patients achieved stable disease. Progressive disease had not been observed in any patient. o At the 10th Congress of the European Hematology Association, updated REVLIMID clinical data were presented from a Phase II multi-center trial (MDS-002) evaluating REVLIMID in patients with low and intermediate risk MDS. The study reported 51% of eligible low and intermediate risk transfusion dependent MDS patients without deletion 5q chromosomal abnormality achieved hematologic improvement, with 33% achieving transfusion independence; Transfusion independence was maintained for a median of 43 weeks, and median hemoglobin increased 3.3 g/dl from a baseline of 8.0 g/dl in responders, on an intent-to-treat basis. The study reported that myelosuppression is common and manageable with treatment interruption and dose adjustment.

CELGENE CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS THREE MONTHS ENDED (UNAUDITED) (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) CELGENE CORPORATION NOTES TO RECONCILIATION OF GAAP EARNINGS TO "ADJUSTED" EARNINGS THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2005 AND 2004 (UNAUDITED) (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) (1) To exclude accelerated depreciation expense related to the relocation of the Company's corporate headquarters. (2) To exclude the Company's share of equity losses in EntreMed, Inc. (3) To exclude the charge recorded for changes in the estimated value of the Company's investment in EntreMed, Inc. warrants. (4) To adjust the income tax provision to a projected cash tax rate of 28.0% and 8.7% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The projected cash tax rate differs from the GAAP provision due primarily to (i) the use of net operating losses that arose from employee stock option deductions that reduce cash taxes, but not the tax provision, (ii) the exercise of employee stock options in the current year that reduce cash taxes, but not the tax provision, and (iii) the payment in the current year of prior year taxes, that increase cash taxes, but not the tax provision. (5) For the three-month period ended June 30, 2005, the Company's convertible debt was anti-dilutive on a GAAP basis but dilutive on an adjusted basis. Accordingly, the weighted-average shares used to compute the adjusted diluted earnings includAes the additional common shares assuming conversion of the convertible debt.
