o Excluding any potential REVLIMID Revenue and Launch Expenses Expected to Total Approximately $35 Million in 2005, Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share Target Affirmed to Achieve $0.55 Range SUMMIT, NJ - (NOVEMBER 3, 2005) - CELGENE CORPORATION (NASDAQ: CELG) announced adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.06 for the quarter ended September 30, 2005. On a reported basis, under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Celgene reported net income of $668.0 thousand compared to net income of $19.0 million, or earnings of $0.11 per diluted share in the third quarter of the prior year. Total product sales for the third quarter increased 35.9 % to $113.9 million from $83.8 million for the prior-year quarter. THALOMID(R) net sales in the third quarter of 2005 increased 25.9% to $99.1 million from $78.7 million in the third quarter of 2004. Celgene posted third quarter adjusted net income of $10.4 million, or adjusted earnings of $0.06 per diluted share compared to adjusted net income of $21.2 million or adjusted earnings of $0.12 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year. For the nine-month period, total product sales reached a record $316.9 million, an increase of 32.6% over the same period in 2004. THALOMID sales for the nine-month period were $281.9 million compared to $222.5 million in 2004, an increase of 26.7% year-over-year. Celgene posted adjusted net income of $60.1 million or adjusted earnings of $0.33 per diluted share, during the nine-month period, compared to adjusted net income of $42.2 million or adjusted earnings of $0.24 per diluted share in the comparable 2004 period. During the nine-month period on a reported basis, Celgene announced GAAP net income of $59.7 million or earnings of $0.33 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $30.5 million or earnings of $0.17 per diluted share in the nine-months of last year. Adjusted net income and per share amounts for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2005, eliminate the effects of charges for accelerated depreciation expense related to the Company's corporate headquarters relocation, charges to record our share of equity losses in EntreMed, Inc. and to adjust the income tax provision to a projected cash tax rate of 28.0 percent. Adjusted net income and per share amounts for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005, also excludes the effects of charges recorded for changes in the estimated value of the Company's investment in EntreMed, Inc. warrants which were exercised on March 31, 2005. Adjusted or Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis because certain unusual or non-recurring items that do not affect the Company's basic operations also do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual non-recurring items. Adjusted earnings are not, and should not be, viewed as a substitute for GAAP net income. Our definition of adjusted earnings may differ from others. To support clinical development and to advance U.S. and European regulatory filings, Celgene increased R&D expenditures in REVLIMID(R) regulatory programs in myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma. Celgene incurred R&D expenses of $49.3 million in the third quarter of 2005, representing an increase of 22.9% compared to the year ago quarter. These R&D expenditures are expected to increase in the fourth quarter in support of our ongoing global
regulatory filings, late stage clinical trials, clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs and related clinical manufacturing costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $46.9 million in the third quarter of 2005, a 69.2% increase over third quarter last year, driven primarily by higher marketing and sales expenses related to product launch activities. Approximately $13 million in marketing and sales expenses, or approximately $0.07 per diluted share, were spent to support pre-launch activities for REVLIMID and THALOMID, and headcount growth in commercial support groups. These marketing and sales expenditures are expected to increase in the fourth quarter 2005 as Celgene optimizes its commercial launch preparations. As of September 30, 2005, Celgene reported $746.0 million in cash and marketable securities, an increase of $22.3 million versus the prior quarter. "We are pleased with the progress of our REVLIMID regulatory application for MDS in the U.S. and Europe achieved during the third quarter," said John W. Jackson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Celgene Corporation." Our commercial preparations are being finalized to ensure rapid access to REVLIMID upon approval." 2005 THIRD QUARTER COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS: CLINICAL AND REGULATORY ACHIEVEMENTS: ------------------------------------- o The Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended full approval of REVLIMID for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. The committee based its recommendation on clinical data from an open label Phase II trial, evaluating REVLIMID(R) in the largest trial with MDS patients with deletion 5q chromosomal abnormality to date. The original action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) for the REVLIMID NDA was extended from October 7, 2005 to January 7, 2006 to allow more time for completion of review of the REVLIMID risk-management program. o The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) accepted the Company's Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for REVLIMID for review. The application is based on clinical data from an open-label Phase II trial, evaluating REVLIMID in the largest clinical trial to date of MDS patients with deletion 5q chromosomal abnormality. Celgene is seeking authorization to market REVLIMID as a treatment for transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.
CORPORATE AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS: -------------------------------------- o The Celgene management team was further strengthened by the addition of Mr. Aart Brouwer as President of Celgene International, Sarl based in Neuchatel, Switzerland. Aart brings over 30 years of global pharmaceutical and biotechnology experience building successful major product franchises throughout Europe. Prior to Celgene, Aart spent 14 years building Amgen's international business in Europe. His accomplishments included building subsidiaries in all of Europe, with Sales, Marketing and high quality Clinical Development organizations. o Celgene contributed $2 million in financial support to an independent, non-profit 501(c)(3) charity whose mission is to support the needs of the underinsured. The foundation provides financial support to eligible patients suffering from certain diseases. These patients have insurance coverage, but may not be able to afford the out-of-pocket costs associated with that coverage, which are necessary to obtain prescription drug therapies critical to their overall treatment. The foundation, which is not affiliated with Celgene, assesses patients' eligibility to receive co-payment assistance based upon its own independent objective eligibility criteria. Celgene has no involvement or influence over any patient eligibility decisions, and is one of many donors to the foundation.

CELGENE CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS THREE MONTHS ENDED (UNAUDITED) (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) CELGENE CORPORATION NOTES TO RECONCILIATION OF GAAP EARNINGS TO "ADJUSTED" EARNINGS THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2005 AND 2004 (UNAUDITED) (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) (1) To exclude accelerated depreciation expense related to the relocation of the Company's corporate headquarters. (2) To exclude the Company's share of equity losses in EntreMed, Inc. and to adjust for our share of THALOMID royalties payable to EntreMed, Inc. (3) To exclude the charge recorded for changes in the estimated value of the Company's investment in EntreMed, Inc. warrants prior to our March 31, 2005 exercise. (4) To adjust the income tax provision to a projected cash tax rate of 28.0% and 8.7% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The projected cash tax rate differs from the GAAP provision due primarily to (i) The recognition of deferred tax assets in the first quarter of 2005 that decreased the tax provision but not cash taxes (ii) the use of net operating losses that arose from employee stock option deductions that reduce cash taxes, but not the tax provision, (iii) the exercise of employee stock options in the current year that reduce cash taxes, but not the tax provision, and (iv) the payment in the current year of prior year taxes, that increase cash taxes, but not the tax provision (5) For the three-month period ended September 30, 2004, the Company's convertible debt was anti-dilutive on a GAAP basis but dilutive on an adjusted basis. Accordingly, the weighted-average shares used to compute the adjusted diluted earnings includes the additional common shares assuming conversion of the convertible debt.
