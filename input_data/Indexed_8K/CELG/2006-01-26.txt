Adjusted net income and per share amounts for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2004 excludes charges recorded for changes in the estimated value of our investment in EntreMed, Inc. warrants and to adjust the income tax provision to reflect cash taxes. To further accelerate the progress of key late-stage regulatory programs, Celgene increased R&D expenditures in REVLIMID(R) Phase II and Phase III regulatory programs in myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma, including the ongoing pivotal Phase III MDS deletion 5q trial to support the Company's MAA seeking approval to market REVLIMID in Europe. Celgene incurred R&D expenses of $52.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, representing an increase of 19% compared to the year ago quarter. These R&D expenditures continue to support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for THALOMID(R), REVLIMID, and for other immunomodulatory drugs such as CC-4047, CC-11006 and CC-10050, as well as in the TNF alpha, kinase and ligase inhibitor programs and stem cell program. Celgene reported $724.3 million in cash and marketable securities as of December 31, 2005. "In 2005, we made great strides across all areas of Celgene, and in 2006, we will continue to prepare for an incredibly promising future," said Celgene Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John W. Jackson. " We believe that the REVLIMID transformation is well on its way." 2005 COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS: CLINICAL, REGULATORY AND DRUG DISCOVERY ACHIEVEMENTS: - ----------------------------------------------------- o The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval of REVLIMID for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. REVLIMID is now available through an Education and Prescribing Safety Program, called RevAssist(SM) via specialty pharmacies. o The FDA granted approval for FOCALIN XR (dexmethylphenidate HCl) extended-release capsules for the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults, adolescents and children. The approval of FOCALIN XR for the treatment of ADHD was based on efficacy and safety data from clinical trials involving approximately 320 adults, adolescents and children diagnosed with ADHD. o The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) accepted for review the Company's Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for REVLIMID. The application is based on the same
clinical data, from an open-label Phase II trial, evaluated by the FDA to support its decision to approve REVLIMID as a treatment for transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. o Celgene submitted its Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for REVLIMID to the Division of Oncology Drug Products at the FDA seeking approval to market REVLIMID as a treatment for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. o Celgene submitted its MAA for REVLIMID to the Swiss Intercantonal Medicines Control Office seeking approval to market REVLIMID as a treatment for transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. o The FDA issued an approvable letter in response to the Company's sNDA seeking approval to market THALOMID as a treatment for multiple myeloma (MM). The FDA requested revised product labeling with the specific indication of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and updated safety information, as well as some additional patient information to finalize its review. The Company has completed its response, and anticipates an action by the FDA in the first half of 2006. o The Company announced that an external Independent Data Monitoring Committee analysis of the multi-centered, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III study (MM-003) evaluating combination thalidomide plus dexamethasone versus dexamethasone alone as induction therapy for previously untreated multiple myeloma met the pre-specified p<0.0015 value for stopping the trial. The IDMC found time to disease progression - the primary endpoint of this Phase III trial - of 75.7 weeks versus 27.9 weeks (p=0.000065), plus progression-free survival of 55.7 weeks versus 24.3 weeks (p=0.0003) in patients receiving THALOMID plus dexamethasone compared to patients receiving dexamethasone alone. o At THE 47TH AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGY MEETING (ASH), clinical investigators from leading cancer research centers presented data from recent and on-going clinical trials of THALOMID, and REVLIMID in broad indications, including survival data in multiple myeloma. The presentations included 30 abstracts clinically evaluating REVLIMID in both oral and poster sessions, including a plenary session, across a broad range of disease indications, as well as 77 abstracts clinically evaluating THALOMID in both oral and poster sessions. o At the ASH plenary session, updated clinical data were presented on two Phase III pivotal studies evaluating REVLIMID plus dexamethasone in previously treated multiple myeloma patients. The updated clinical data from the pivotal International Phase III trial (MM-010), demonstrated that the combination of REVLIMID plus dexamethasone led to a statistically significant improvement in median time to disease progression (p=0.001). The updated clinical data from the pivotal North American Phase III trial (MM-009), reported that the combination of REVLIMID(R) plus dexamethasone led to a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in addition to a statistically significant improvement in
median time to disease progression. As of June 2005, median overall survival in patients treated with REVLIMID plus dexamethasone has not been reached as compared to 104 weeks with dexamethasone plus placebo (p=0.013). o At ASH, clinical data from two phase III studies evaluating oral combination THALOMID(R) reported survival advantage for elderly newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. The Italian study reported a statistically significant difference in event-free survival of 68 percent versus 32 percent (p<0.001) after twenty-six months of treatment with melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (MPT) versus melphalan and prednisone (MP) alone. The French study reported a significant difference in progression-free survival of 73 percent versus 55 percent (p=0.0001) after treatment with MPT versus melphalan and autologous stem cell transplant. Importantly, the study reported a significant difference in overall survival that has not been reached after 55 months. o At the XXIII Chemotherapy Foundation Symposium, preliminary clinical data evaluating THALOMID as an oral combination therapy for the treatment of recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer in patients who had received prior treatments reported 50% of patients achieved overall response in median progression free survival. 2005 CORPORATE AND COMMERCIAL ACHIEVEMENTS: - ------------------------------------------- o Celgene announced that its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John W. Jackson will retire as Chief Executive Officer on May 1, 2006. Mr. Jackson will continue as Chairman of the Board of Directors and stand for re-election at the Company's annual meeting on June 15, 2006. On May 1st, Sol J.

The stock split is subject to stockholder's approval to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 280,000,000 to 580,000,000, an action that will be voted on at a Special Meeting of the Stockholders on February 16, 2006. o Celgene expanded its international infrastructure through investments in ongoing commercial, manufacturing, clinical and regulatory activities in Europe to support the potential launch of REVLIMID for the treatment of MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality, as well as preparations for the potential launch of REVLIMID as a treatment for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. o Celgene was added to the Nasdaq-100 Index(R), and included in the Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock (NASDAQ: QQQQ).
