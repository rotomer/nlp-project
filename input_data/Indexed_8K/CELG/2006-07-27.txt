On a reported basis under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Celgene reported net income of $9.6 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.03, including share-based employee compensation expense, compared to net income in the prior year period of $10.8 million. Total revenue was a record $197.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, an increase of 35.4% (56.8% excluding a one-time milestone payment) over the same period in 2005 driven by strong REVLIMID net sales of $63.0 million, and THALOMID net sales of $107.2 million, an increase of 13.5% year-over-year. ALKERAN(R) net sales for the second quarter were $4.5 million compared to $9.1 million in 2005. Revenue from
Focalin(TM) and the Ritalin(R) family of drugs totaled $17.7 million for the second quarter compared to $15.8 million over the same period last year, excluding a $20 million milestone payment for the NDA approval of FOCALIN XR(TM). For the six-month period, total net product sales reached a record $336.6 million, an increase of 65.8% over the same period in 2005. REVLIMID(R) sales for the six-month period reached $95.5 million. THALOMID(R) sales for the six-month period were $214.4 million compared to $182.8 million in 2005, an increase of 17.3% year-over-year. Celgene posted adjusted net income of $76.2 million or adjusted earnings of $0.20 per diluted share, during the six-month period, compared to adjusted net income of $49.9 million or adjusted earnings of $0.14 per diluted share in the comparable 2005 period. During the six-month period on a reported basis, Celgene announced GAAP net income of $25.6 million or earnings of $0.07 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $59.1 million or earnings of $0.16 per diluted share in the first six-months of last year. Adjusted net income and adjusted per share amounts for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2006, eliminate the effects of charges for share-based employee compensation expense associated with the application of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment", (SFAS 123(R)) during the 2006 periods. The after tax net impact of share-based employee compensation expense reduced GAAP diluted earnings by $14.2 million, or $0.04 per share for the three-month period ended June 30, 2006 and by $25.2 million, or $0.07 per share for the six-month period ended June 30, 2006. Adjusted net income and per share amounts, for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, also excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles resulting from the acquisition of Penn T Limited, charges for accelerated depreciation expense related to the Company's corporate headquarters relocation and charges to record our share of equity losses in EntreMed, Inc., and to adjust the income tax provision to reflect a projected cash tax rate of 32.0% and 28.0% for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Adjusted net income and per share amounts, for the three-month period ended June 30, 2006 and six-month period ended June 30, 2006 and 2005 also excludes gains (losses) recorded for changes in the estimated value of our investment in EntreMed, Inc. warrants. Adjusted or Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the Company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual non-recurring items. Adjusted earnings are not, and should not be, viewed as a substitute for GAAP net income. We define adjusted diluted earnings per share amounts as adjusted net income divided by the GAAP weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others. Based on its commitment to bring more disease-altering therapies to patients in need, Celgene continued to advance development of promising compounds in early-stage, preclinical and discovery programs. The Company increased R&D investments in multiple Phase II and Phase III programs evaluating REVLIMID across a broad range of hematological cancers with unmet
medical needs including: multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic lymphocyte leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In the second quarter of 2006, Celgene incurred adjusted R&D expenses of $53.6 million, representing an increase of 9.4% compared to the year ago quarter. These R&D expenditures support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID(R) and THALOMID(R) internationally; for other promising immunomodulatory drugs such as CC-4047, CC-11006 and CC-10015; for our lead anti-inflammatory compound, CC-10004, and our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs and placental-derived stem cell program. On a reported GAAP basis R&D expenses were $57.0 million. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $63.7 million in the second quarter of 2006 driven primarily by significantly higher marketing and sales expenses related to increased product launch activities in the United States both for REVLIMID and THALOMID, and headcount growth to support Celgene international expansion in Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada. On a reported GAAP basis selling, general and administrative expenses were $82.8 million. Celgene reported $758 million in cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2006, an increase of $33 million year-over-year. "We are very pleased with the FDA action to approve REVLIMID and THALOMID as oral therapies for multiple myeloma patients in need. Having begun our formal launch we are now looking forward to maximizing REVLIMID's full commercial and clinical potential," said Celgene Chief Executive Officer Sol J. Barer.
