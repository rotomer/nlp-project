Based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Celgene reported net income of $20.4 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.05 for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, including share-based employee compensation expense, compared to net income in the prior year period of $0.7 million. Total revenue was a record $244.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, an increase of 89.1% over the same period in 2005 driven by REVLIMID net sales of $101.3 million, and THALOMID net sales of $108.4 million, an increase of 9.3% year-over-year. ALKERAN(R) net sales for the Third Quarter were $12.2 million in 2006 compared to $13.9 million in 2005. Revenue from Focalin(TM) and the Ritalin(R) family of drugs totaled $17.9 million for the Third Quarter of 2006 compared to $10.7 million over the same period last year. For the nine-month period, total net product sales reached a record $559.7 million, an increase of 76.6% over the same period in 2005. REVLIMID(R) sales for the nine-month period reached $196.8 million. THALOMID(R) sales for the nine-month period of 2006 were $322.8 million compared to $282.0 million in 2005, an increase of 14.5% year-over-year. Celgene posted
adjusted net income of $135.7 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.35, during the nine-month period of 2006, compared to adjusted net income of $60.6 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.17 in the comparable 2005 period. During the nine-month period on a reported basis of 2006, Celgene announced GAAP net income of $46.1 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.12, compared to GAAP net income of $59.7 million or earnings of $0.16 per diluted share in the first nine-months of last year, which did not include charges for stock option expense. Adjusted net income and adjusted per share amounts for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2006, eliminate the effects of charges for share-based employee compensation expense associated with the application of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment", (SFAS 123(R)). The after tax net impact of share-based employee compensation expense reduced GAAP net income by $15.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share for the three-month period ended September 30, 2006 and by $40.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted share for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006. Adjusted net income and per share amounts, for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, excludes amortization of acquisition intangibles resulting from the acquisition of Penn T Limited and charges to record our share of equity losses in EntreMed, Inc. Also, adjusted net income and per share amounts, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2006 and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 excludes gains (losses) recorded for changes in the estimated value of our investment in EntreMed, Inc. warrants. The nine-month periods ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the three-month period ended September 30, 2005, also excludes accelerated depreciation expense related to the Company's corporate headquarters relocation. Adjusted net income and per share amounts, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 includes adjustments to the income tax provision to reflect a projected cash tax rate of 32.0% and 28.0%, respectively. Adjusted or Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the Company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual non-recurring items. Adjusted earnings are not, and should not be, viewed as a substitute for GAAP net income. We define adjusted diluted earnings per share amounts as adjusted net income divided by the GAAP weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others. In support of the Company's commitment to bring more disease-altering therapies to patients in need, Celgene continued to advance development of promising compounds in early-stage, preclinical and discovery programs. The Company increased R&D investments in multiple Phase II and Phase III programs evaluating REVLIMID across a broad range of hematological cancers with unmet medical needs including: multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic lymphocyte leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and myelofibrosis. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company incurred adjusted R&D expenses of $64.1 million, representing an increase of 29.8% compared to the year ago quarter. These R&D expenditures support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID(R) and THALOMID(R) internationally; for other promising immunomodulatory compounds such as CC-4047, CC-11006
and CC-10015; for our lead anti-inflammatory compounds CC-10004 and CC-11050; and our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs and placental-derived stem cell program. On a reported GAAP basis R&D expenses were $66.8 million in the third quarter of 2006. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $67.3 million, representing an increase of 5.6% over the second quarter of 2006 and an increase of 44.2% compared to the year ago quarter. Expenses during the third quarter of 2006 were driven primarily by significantly higher marketing and sales expenses related to REVLIMID and THALOMID product launch activities in the United States, and continued expansion of Celgene International in 23 countries, including Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada. On a reported GAAP basis selling, general and administrative expenses were $89.6 million in the third quarter of 2006. Celgene reported $872.5 million in cash and marketable securities as of September 30, 2006, an increase of $148.2 million from December 31, 2005. "During the third quarter we continued to make significant progress towards our objective to maximize REVLIMID's full commercial and clinical potential worldwide," said Celgene Chief Executive Officer Sol J. Barer. "We continue to build on our strong science capabilities and to invest in our future by advancing promising compounds through our research and development pipeline."
