2007 Milestones:
Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) announced adjusted net income of $85.6 million, or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.20 for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. Based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Celgene reported net income of $57.4 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.14 for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, including after-tax share-based employee compensation expense of $7.8 million, compared to net income in the prior year period of $16.0 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.04, including after-tax share-based employee compensation expense of $11.1 million. Total revenue was a record $293.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, an increase of 61.4% over the same period in 2006. The increase in total revenue was driven by REVLIMID net sales of $146.2 million. THALOMIDnet sales reached $106 million. ALKERAN net sales for the first quarter were $16.0 million in 2007 compared to $18.3 million in 2006. Revenue from Focalin and the Ritalin family of drugs totaled $19.8 million for the first quarter of 2007 compared to $19.4 million over the same period last year.
SUMMIT, NJ  (May 3, 2007) 
See the attached Consolidated Statements of Operations and Reconciliation of GAAP Earnings to Adjusted Earnings for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at adjusted net income, adjusted per share amounts and adjusted pro-forma income tax rate, for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2007 and 2006. Adjusted or Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the Company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Adjusted net income is not, and should not be, viewed as a substitute for GAAP net income. We define adjusted diluted earnings per share amounts as adjusted net income divided by the GAAP weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.
 
To support clinical development and to advance global regulatory filings the Company increased R&D investments in multiple international clinical programs evaluating REVLIMIDand other IMIDs across a broad range of hematological cancers with unmet medical needs including: multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic lymphocyte leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, myelofibrosis and hemoglobinopathies. For the first quarter period of 2007, the Company incurred adjusted R&D expenses of $77.0 million. These R&D expenditures support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID and THALOMID; for other IMiDs compounds such as CC-4047, CC-11006, CC-10015, CC-13097 and CC-15965; for our lead anti-inflammatory compounds CC-10004 and CC-11050; our pleiotropic pathway modifier program; as well as our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs and placental-derived stem cell program. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $79.6 million for the first quarter period of 2007.
Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $98.6 million for the first quarter period in 2007. SG&A expenses were driven primarily by significantly higher marketing and sales expenses related to product launch activities in Europe, increased contributions to non-profit co-pay foundations and continued expansion of Celgene International in more than 30 countries, including Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada. European marketing and sales expenditures are expected to increase in the second and third quarters of 2007 as Celgene optimizes its commercial launch preparations. On a reported GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $107.4 million for the first quarter period in 2007.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2007, adjusted net interest and other net income (expense) increased $19.3 million to $23.1 million over the same period in 2006.
Celgene reported more than $2.1 billion in cash and marketable securities as of March 31, 2007, an increase of $133 million over the sequential quarter ended December 31, 2006.
"The financial and operational results of first quarter 2007 were outstanding. These results clearly reflect the positive efforts of the global Celgene team and its partners," said Celgene Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sol J. Barer. "As a result of the strong momentum established in the first quarter, Celgene is positioned favorably to achieve its key objectives in 2007."
