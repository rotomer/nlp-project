Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) announced adjusted net income of $110.4 million, or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.26 for the quarter ended June 30, 2007. Based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Celgene reported net income of $54.9 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.13 for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, including after-tax share-based employee compensation expense of $12.7 million, compared to net income in the prior year period of $9.6 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.03, including after-tax share-based employee compensation expense of $20.7 million. Total revenue was a record $347.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, an increase of 76.4% over the same period in 2006. The increase in total revenue was driven by REVLIMID net sales of $180.9 million, an increase of 187.2% over the same period in 2006. THALOMID net sales reached $117.7 million. ALKERAN net sales for the second quarter of 2007 were $18.7 million compared to $4.5 million in the second quarter of 2006.

SUMMIT, NJ  (July 26, 2007) 
For the six-month period of 2007, total revenue was a record $641.3 million, an increase of 69.2% year-over-year. Total net product sales reached a record $588.7 million, an increase of 74.9% year-over-year. REVLIMID net sales for the six-month period of 2007 reached $327.2 million compared to $95.5 million in 2006. THALOMID net sales for the six-month period of 2007 were $223.7 million compared to $214.4 million in 2006. Celgene posted adjusted net income of $196.1 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.46 during the six-month period of 2007, compared to adjusted net income of $76.2 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.20 for the six-month period of 2006. For the six-month period of 2007 on a U.S. GAAP basis, Celgene reported net income of $112.3 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.27, compared to net income of $25.6 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.07 in 2006.
See the attached Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Reconciliation of GAAP Earnings to Adjusted Earnings for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at adjusted net income, adjusted per share amounts and adjusted pro-forma income tax rate, for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2007 and 2006. Adjusted or Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the Company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define adjusted diluted earnings per share amounts as adjusted net income divided by the GAAP weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.
 
To support clinical development and to advance global regulatory filings the Company increased R&D investments in multiple international clinical programs evaluating REVLIMID and other IMIDs compounds. For the second quarter of 2007, the Company incurred adjusted R&D expenses of $86.6 million. These R&D expenditures support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID and other IMiDs compounds; for our lead oral anti-inflammatory compounds; our pleiotropic pathway modifier program; as well as our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs and placental-derived stem cell program. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $89.9 million for the second quarter of 2007.
Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $103.3 million for the second quarter in 2007. SG&A include increased spending for marketing and sales expenses related to product launch activities in Europe and continued expansion of Celgene International in nearly 35 countries, including Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada. Marketing and sales expenses are expected to remain flat in the third and fourth quarters of 2007. On a reported GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $114.0 million for the second quarter in 2007.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2007, adjusted net interest and other net income (expense) increased to $23.6 million from $7.7 million over the same period in 2006.
Celgene reported more than $2.3 billion in cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2007, an increase of $207 million over the sequential quarter ended March 31, 2007.

"We are building a world leading hematology-oncology Company with a major presence in inflammatory diseases. As a result of the strong momentum established in the second quarter we have made significant progress towards accomplishing that mission."
