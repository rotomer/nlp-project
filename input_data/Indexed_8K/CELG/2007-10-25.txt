See the attached Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Reconciliation of GAAP Earnings to Adjusted Earnings for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at adjusted net income, adjusted per share amounts and adjusted pro-forma income tax rate, for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2007 and 2006. Adjusted or Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the Company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define adjusted diluted earnings per share amounts as adjusted net income divided by the GAAP weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.
To support clinical development and to advance global regulatory filings the Company increased R&D investments in multiple international clinical programs evaluating REVLIMIDand other IMIDs compounds. For the third quarter of 2007, the Company incurred adjusted R&D expenses of $84.3 million. These R&D expenditures support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID and other IMiDs compounds; for our lead oral anti-inflammatory compounds; our pleiotropic pathway modifier program; as well as our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs and placental-derived stem cell program. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $130.5 million for the third quarter of 2007, including a one-time charge of $41 million dollars primarily for the 2007 collaboration arrangement with Array BioPharma.
Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $85.7 million for the third quarter in 2007 compared to $67.3 million for the quarter ending September 30, 2006. The increase of 27 percent is due to marketing and sales expenses related to product launch activities in Europe and continued expansion of Celgene International in over 40 countries and regions including the rest of Europe, Japan, Australia, and Canada. On a reported GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $97.3 million for the third quarter in 2007.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2007, adjusted net interest and other net income (expense) increased to $26.5 million from $8.1 million over the same period in 2006.
Celgene reported more than $2.5 billion in cash and marketable securities as of September 30, 2007, an increase of $208 million over the sequential quarter ended June 30, 2007.
