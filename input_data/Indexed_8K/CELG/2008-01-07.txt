 Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) will review 2007 achievements and provide outlook for 2008 milestones at the JPMorgan 26th Annual Healthcare Conference. In 2007, Celgene achieved exceptional results in all areas of its global operations, underscored by EMEA approval for REVLIMID and globalization of Celgene operations in more than 40 countries.
SUMMIT, NJ  (January 6, 2008)
The Company's commercial performance is based on record total revenue and profits supported primarily by the initial launch of REVLIMID in several European countries as well as from multiple product revenue streams that include, REVLIMID, THALOMID, ALKERAN, FOCALIN XR and the Ritalin Family of products. The successful growth of product revenue continues to reflect the positive reception by hematologist/oncologists worldwide for REVLIMID based on approved indications in multiple countries, compendia listing for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma in the United States, clinical findings across a broad range of blood cancers presented worldwide at major international medical meetings, and reported in peer-reviewed publications.
 
In 2007, preliminary unaudited results indicate that total revenue will increase by more than 50 percent, year-over-year, to approximately $1.4 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to double to approximately $1.05. The Company will report its 2007 full-year financial results on January 31, 2008.
2008 total revenue growth is targeted to increase more than 30 percent to approximately $1.8 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are targeted to increase approximately 45 percent to a range of $1.50 to $1.55.
