Total revenue was $414.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 50.8 percent from 2006. The increase in total revenue was driven by REVLIMID net sales of $247.4 million, an increase of 100 percent over the same period in 2006. THALOMIDnet sales reached $112.6 million. ALKERAN net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $20 million compared to $15.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, an increase of 29.7 percent.

SUMMIT, NJ  (January 31, 2008) 
 
For the full year of 2007, total revenue was a record $1.406 billion, an increase of 56.4 percent year-over-year. Total net product sales reached a record $1.3 billion, an increase of 60.2 percent year-over-year. REVLIMID net sales for the full year 2007 reached $773.9 million compared to $320.6 million in 2006. THALOMID net sales for the full year 2007 were $447.1 million compared to $433.0 million in 2006. Celgene posted adjusted net income of $452.9 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.06 during the full year 2007, compared to adjusted net income of $210.1 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.53 for 2006. For the full year of 2007 on a U.S. GAAP basis, Celgene reported net income of $226.4 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.54, compared to GAAP net income of $69 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.18 in 2006.
See the attached Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Reconciliation of GAAP Earnings to Adjusted Earnings for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at adjusted net income, adjusted per share amounts and adjusted pro-forma income tax rate, for the three-month and full-year periods ended December 31, 2007, and 2006. Adjusted or Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the Company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define adjusted diluted earnings per share amounts as adjusted net income divided by the GAAP weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.
To support clinical development and to advance global regulatory filings, the Company increased R&D investments in multiple international clinical programs evaluating REVLIMIDand other IMIDs compounds. For the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company incurred adjusted R&D expenses of $93 million. These R&D expenditures support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID and other IMiDs compounds; for our lead oral anti-inflammatory compounds; our pleiotropic pathway modifier program; as well as our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs and placental-derived stem cell program. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $98.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2007.
Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses were $119.8 million for the fourth quarter in 2007 compared to $83 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. The increase is due to marketing and sales expenses related to product launch activities in Western Europe and continued expansion of Celgene International in over 50 countries and regions including the rest of Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, Russia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. On a reported GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $133.2 million for the fourth quarter in 2007.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2007, adjusted interest and other income, net, increased to $28.1 million compared to $17.3 million in the same period in 2006.
 
Celgene reported $2.739 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2007, an increase of $209.2 million over the sequential quarter ended September 30, 2007.
"These major accomplishments across all business functions position Celgene to achieve even greater success in 2008 and beyond that will benefit both our patients and stakeholders around the world," said Celgene Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sol J. Barer, Ph.D.
