The transaction brings together three medically meaningful therapies, Revlimid, Thalomid and Vidaza, treating patients worldwide. These products are expected to generate multiple global revenue streams for accelerated financial growth as we move into nearly 100 countries over the next five years and beyond.
"By bringing together these two outstanding companies, we are creating a global leader in hematology/oncology," said Sol J. Barer, PhD, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Celgene Corporation. "We are now able to serve these patients through three major approved therapies, with a strong portfolio of hematology and solid tumor candidates advancing through our pipeline to address future needs. In addition, we have a number of innovative programs encompassing therapies for immune/inflammatory disorders, hematological malignancies and other cancers. We believe our combined capabilities can maximize the clinical, regulatory and commercial potential of all of these programs."
Celgene plans to announce its first quarter financial results on Thursday, May 8 at which time it will also provide updated 2008 financial guidance relative to the acquisition, as well as provide an update on the initiation of its global integration strategy. As the Company has stated, it expects the acquisition to be slightly dilutive to earnings in 2008, accretive in 2009 and materially accretive in 2010 and beyond.
Celgene Corporation, headquartered in Summit, New Jersey, is an integrated global biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases through gene and protein regulation.
