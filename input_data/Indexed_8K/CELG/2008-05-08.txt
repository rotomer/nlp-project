Based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Celgene reported net losses of $1.64 billion, or diluted earnings per share of ($3.98) for the quarter ended March 31, 2008. The first quarter of 2008 included an after-tax in-process research and development charge of $1.74 billion associated with the acquisition of Pharmion Corporation, and the after-tax impact of share-based employee compensation expense of $17.5 million, compared to net income in the prior year of $57.4 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.14, including the after-tax impact of share-based employee compensation expense of $7.8 million.
SUMMIT, NJ  (May 8, 2008) 
Non-GAAP total revenue was $461.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, an increase of 57 percent from 2007. GAAP total revenue was $462.6 million. The increase in total revenue was driven by REVLIMID net sales of $286.8 million, an increase of 96 percent over the same period in 2007. THALOMIDnet sales reached $113.9 million. ALKERAN net sales for the first quarter of 2008 were $15.1 million compared to $16.0 million in the first quarter of 2007. Revenue from Focalin and the Ritalin family of drugs totaled $25.9 million for the first quarter of 2008 compared to $19.8 million over the same period last year. First quarter 2008 product sales included only three weeks of revenue from VIDAZA and international thalidomide sales from March 8, 2008 through March 31, 2008.
To support clinical development and to advance global regulatory filings, the Company increased R&D investments in multiple international clinical programs. For the first quarter of 2008 on a non-GAAP basis the Company incurred R&D expenses, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and the $45 million dollar upfront collaborative payment to Acceleron, of $102.3 million compared to $77.0 million for the first quarter of 2007. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $156.9 million compared to $79.6 for the same quarter in 2007. These R&D expenditures support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID and other IMiDs compounds; for apremilast (CC-10004), and other oral anti-inflammatory compounds; our pleiotropic pathway modifier program; as well as our kinase inhibitor and placental-derived stem cell programs. In the second quarter of 2008, our R&D expenditures will expand to include programs that support clinical research for VIDAZA, and other epigenetic compounds, as well as amrubicin, our lead compound for small cell lung cancer.
 
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, which exclude stock-based compensation expenses, were $129.3 million for the first quarter of 2008 compared to $98.6 million for the first quarter of 2007. On a GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $140.5 million for the first quarter in 2008 compared to $105.2 million for the same quarter in 2007. The increase reflects marketing and sales expenses related to ongoing product launch activities in Europe. Also, the increased expenses reflect the continued expansion of Celgene International operations in over 50 countries.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2008, interest and other income, (net) increased to $28.3 million compared to $23.0 million in the same period during the prior year.
Celgene reported $2.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of March 31, 2008, a decrease of $700.0 million over the quarter ended December 31, 2007, reflecting the cash used in connection with the acquisition of Pharmion.
"The clinical, regulatory and commercial momentum established in the first quarter continues to advance our business and strategic programs toward maximizing the global potential of Celgene," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sol J. Barer, Ph.D. "The Pharmion acquisition brings together extraordinary people, science and resources that continues to expand our portfolio of innovative therapies, our industry leading programs for access, safety and patient support, and ultimately moves us closer to our vision of becoming the leading hematology and oncology company in the world."
See the attached Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the three-months ended March 31, 2008, and 2007. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the Company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define non-GAAP diluted earnings per share amounts as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.
