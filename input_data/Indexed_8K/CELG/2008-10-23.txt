Based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), Celgene reported net income of $136.8 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.29 for the quarter ended September 30, 2008. GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2008 included the after-tax impact of share-based employee compensation expense of $22.3 million. GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2007 was $38.8 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.09, including the after-tax impact of share-based employee compensation expense of $12.8 million.
SUMMIT, NJ  (October 23, 2008) 
Non-GAAP total revenue was $586.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, an increase of 68 percent over the same period in 2007. GAAP total revenue was $592.5 million. The increase in total revenue was driven by REVLIMID net sales of $342.6 million, an increase of 72 percent over the same period in 2007. Global THALOMID/Thalidomide and VIDAZA net sales reached $132.4 million and $63.5 million, respectively. ALKERAN net sales for the third quarter of 2008 were $21.8 million compared to $18.9 million in the third quarter of 2007. Revenue from Focalin and the Ritalin family of drugs totaled $23.8 million for the third quarter of 2008 compared to $15.8 million over the same period last year.
For the first nine months of 2008, non-GAAP total revenue was $1.614 billion, an increase of 63 percent year-over-year. REVLIMID net sales for the first nine months of 2008 reached $955.2 million compared to $526.5 million in 2007, an increase of 81 percent year-over-year. Global THALOMID/Thalidomide and VIDAZA net sales for the first nine months of 2008 were $377.9 million, and $137.0 million, respectively. Celgene posted non-GAAP net income of $517.9 million or non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.13 during the first nine months of 2008. For the first nine months of 2008, on a GAAP basis, Celgene reported a net loss of $1.384 billion, or a loss per diluted share of $3.17, compared to GAAP net income of $151.1 million, or earnings per diluted share of $0.36 for the first nine months of 2007.
To support clinical development and to advance global regulatory filings, the company increased R&D investments in multiple international clinical programs. For the third quarter of 2008 on a non-GAAP basis the company incurred R&D expenses, which exclude share-based compensation expense, of $149.9 million compared to $84.6 million for the third quarter of 2007. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $160.9 million compared to $130.8 million for the same quarter in 2007. These R&D expenditures continue to support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID; pomalidomide and other IMiDs compounds; VIDAZA; amrubicin, our lead compound for small cell lung cancer; apremilast (CC-10004); and other oral anti-inflammatory compounds; our pleiotropic pathway modifier program; our kinase inhibitor program; and our placental-derived stem cell programs.
 
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, which exclude share-based compensation expense, were $152.0 million for the third quarter of 2008 compared to $85.5 million for the third quarter of 2007. On a GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $168.6 million for the third quarter in 2008 compared to $94.7 million for the same quarter in 2007. The increase reflects marketing and sales expenses related to ongoing product launch activities for REVLIMID and Global Thalidomide in Europe, Canada and Australia, as well as activities for the relaunch of VIDAZA in the U.S. and preparation for VIDAZA launch in Europe. Also, the increased expenses reflect the continued expansion of the international operations of Celgene in over 65 countries.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2008, interest and other income, net was $21.6 million compared to $26.4 million in the same period during the prior year. Celgene reported $2.454 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2008.
"The third quarter results reflect our ongoing progress marked by multiple commercial, clinical, regulatory, operational and financial milestones toward our goal of becoming the premier global biopharmaceutical company," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sol J. Barer, Ph.D. "The results achieved by our worldwide team demonstrate the value of our innovative products for our patients and stakeholders."
See the attached Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define non-GAAP diluted earnings per share amounts as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.

Explanation of adjustments:
Adjusted net income and earnings per share on both a basic and diluted basis have been revised for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2007 to conform to the current year's presentation basis. Amounts reported in the previous year for the three-month period ended September 30, 2007 were $124,078, $0.32 and $0.29, respectively. Amounts reported in the previous year for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 were $320,144, $0.84 and $0.75, respectively. The current year basis eliminates certain immaterial adjustments and revises the method for determining the tax impact of pro-forma adjustments. The 2007 adjusted income tax provision previously reported reflected a pro-forma annual income tax rate of 28.0%.
