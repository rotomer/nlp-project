2009 Selected Corporate Objectives:
Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) announced non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income of $200.9 million, or non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.43 for the quarter ended December 31, 2008. Based on U.S. GAAP, Celgene reported a net loss of $149.3 million, or a loss per diluted share of $0.33 for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, including the after-tax impact of share-based employee compensation expense of $24.3 million. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $75.3 million, or earnings per diluted share of $0.18, including the after-tax impact of share-based employee compensation expense of $15.3 million.
SUMMIT, NJ  (January 29, 2009) 
Non-GAAP total revenue was $623.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, an increase of more than 50 percent from 2007. GAAP total revenue was $628.3 million. The increase in total revenue was driven by global market share gains and increased duration of therapy of REVLIMID. This resulted in REVLIMID net sales of $369.4 million, an increase of more than 49 percent over the same period in 2007. Global THALOMID/Thalidomide and VIDAZA net sales reached $126.8 million and $69.7 million, respectively. ALKERAN net sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $24.4 million compared to $20.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. As of March 31, 2009, ALKERAN will no longer be commercialized by Celgene as we conclude the ALKERAN license agreement with GlaxoSmithKline. Revenue from Focalin and the Ritalin family of drugs totaled $27.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $28.4 million over the same period last year.
 
For the full year of 2008, non-GAAP total revenue was a record $2.238 billion, an increase of 59 percent year-over-year. GAAP total revenue was $2.255 billion. Total non-GAAP net product sales reached a record $2.121 billion, an increase of 63 percent year-over-year. REVLIMID net sales for the full year 2008 reached $1.325 billion compared to $773.9 million in 2007. Global THALOMID/Thalidomide net sales for the full year 2008 were $504.7 million. VIDAZA net sales for the full year 2008 reached $206.7 million. Celgene posted non-GAAP net income of $718.8 million or non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.56 during the full year 2008. For the full year of 2008, on a GAAP basis, Celgene reported a net loss of $1.534 billion or a loss per diluted share of $3.46, compared to GAAP net income of $226.4 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.54 in 2007.
To support clinical development and to advance global regulatory filings, the company increased R&D investments in multiple international clinical programs around a deepened and diversified pipeline. For the fourth quarter of 2008, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $153.8 million compared to $93.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. These R&D expenditures continue to support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID, pomalidomide and other IMiDs compounds; VIDAZA; amrubicin, our lead compound for small cell lung cancer; apremilast and our oral anti-inflammatory compounds; as well as our kinase inhibitor programs; our Activin inhibitor program and placenta-derived stem cell programs. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $468.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, including share-based employee compensation expense and the purchase of the VIDAZA royalty obligation.
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses were $181.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $119.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase is due to marketing and sales expenses related to product launch activities in Western Europe, the re-launch of VIDAZA in the U.S. as a result of the expanded survival label and continued expansion of the international operations of Celgene in over 65 countries and regions including Eastern Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, Russia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. On a GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $200.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, including share-based employee compensation expense.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2008, interest and other income, net, increased to $34.9 million compared to $28.1 million in the same period in 2007.
Celgene reported $2.222 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2008, a decrease of $517 million over the year ended December 31, 2007. This reflects the net cash component related to the acquisition of Pharmion of $747 million and the purchase of a previous royalty obligation for VIDAZA for all future periods of $425 million, partly offset by cash generated from operations during the year.
 
"2008 was an exceptional year for Celgene as we continued to build a major global biopharmaceutical company," said Celgene Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sol J. Barer, Ph.D. "We delivered impressive financial results. We strengthened our global business franchise in hematology. We significantly advanced our clinical programs, and strengthened our pipeline of early stage compounds. We have never been more optimistic about our prospects, and we look forward to exceptional growth over the next five years, and beyond."
See the attached Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the three-month and full year periods ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define non-GAAP diluted earnings per share amounts as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.

Amounts reported in the previous year for the twelve-month period were $452,940, $1.18 and $1.06, respectively. The current year basis eliminates certain immaterial adjustments and revises the method for determining the tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments. The 2007 adjusted income tax provision previously reported reflected a non-GAAP annual income tax rate of 28.0%.
