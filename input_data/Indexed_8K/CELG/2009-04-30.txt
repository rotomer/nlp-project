"Despite a challenging global economic environment, we continue to deliver strong operational and financial results. We continue to execute our long-term growth strategy by strengthening our global franchise in hematology, maximizing the potential of our clinical programs, and advancing our pipeline of early stage compounds. Based on our long-term outlook, we are confident about our prospects, and we look forward to exceptional growth over the next five years and beyond," said Celgene Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sol J. Barer, Ph.D.
Non-GAAP total revenue was $601.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, an increase of approximately 30 percent from the same period in 2008. GAAP total revenue was $605.1 million. The increase in total revenue was driven by global market share gains and increased number of patients, prescriptions and duration of therapy of REVLIMID. This resulted in REVLIMID net sales of $362.5 million, an increase of more than 26 percent over the same period in 2008. THALOMID (inclusive of Thalidomide Pharmion subsequent to the acquisition of Pharmion Corporation on March 7, 2008) and VIDAZA net sales reached $114.0 million and $75.4 million, respectively. ALKERAN net sales for the first quarter of 2009 were $19.9 million compared to $15.1 million in the first quarter of 2008. Effective March 31, 2009, ALKERAN is no longer commercialized by Celgene as we concluded the ALKERAN license agreement with GlaxoSmithKline. Revenue from Focalin and the Ritalin family of drugs totaled $26.8 million for the first quarter of 2009 compared to $25.9 million during the same period last year.

See the attached Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2009 and 2008. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before, during and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define non-GAAP diluted earnings per share amounts as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.
