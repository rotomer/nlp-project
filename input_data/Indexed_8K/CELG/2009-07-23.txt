2009 Selected Corporate Objectives:
Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG) announced non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income of $216.0 million, or non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.46 for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Based on U.S. GAAP, Celgene reported net income of $142.8 million, or earnings per diluted share of $0.31 for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $119.9 million, or earnings per diluted share of $0.26.
SUMMIT, NJ  (July 23, 2009) 
 
Celgene posted non-GAAP net income of $421.2 million or non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.90 during the first six months of 2009 as compared to non-GAAP net income of $332.0 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.73 in 2008. On a GAAP basis, Celgene reported net income of $305.7 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.65 for the first six months of 2009, compared to GAAP net loss of $1.521 billion or a loss per diluted share of $3.56 in 2008, which was primarily due to an in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Pharmion Corporation in March 2008.
"The second quarter was one of exceptional results across many functions, including significant progress on the commercial, clinical, and financial fronts", said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sol J. Barer, Ph.D., "We continue to launch our best-in-class therapies across the globe and now have sales and operations in more than 70 countries. We are pleased with the continued market share and durations gains achieved by REVLIMID during the quarter, progress that is particularly encouraging given the challenging economic environment. Finally, we are looking forward to reporting data from multiple key clinical trials throughout the remainder of 2009 as we advance our deep and diverse clinical pipeline".
The first pre-specified interim analysis of MM-015, a 459 patient, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, phase III trial comparing melphalan, prednisone, REVLIMID (MPR) followed by continuous REVLIMID (MPR+R) and MPR followed by placebo and melphalan and prednisone followed by placebo (MP+Pl) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma ineligible for stem cell transplantation was conducted at 50% of the planned number of progression free survival (PFS) events.
MM-015 Update
The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) met this week and notified Celgene that the pre-specified efficacy analysis comparing MPR+R to MP+Pl demonstrated a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary efficacy endpoint of PFS. This difference crossed the O'Brien-Fleming boundary for superiority. In addition, no safety concerns were reported by the IDMC.
Celgene will meet with regulatory authorities over the next few months and will discuss potential filing strategies for Europe, the United States and other international markets for the use of REVLIMID in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We expect the MM-015 trial results to be presented at the December 2009 meeting of the American Society of Hematology.
Non-GAAP total revenue was $626.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, an increase of more than 10 percent from 2008. GAAP total revenue was $628.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. The increase in total revenue was driven by global market share gains and increased duration of therapy of REVLIMIDand the global growth of VIDAZA. REVLIMID net sales were $397.3 million, an increase of 22 percent over the same period in 2008. THALOMID net sales (inclusive of Thalidomide Pharmion and Thalidomide Celgene) were $105.2 million. VIDAZA net sales were $92.0 million, an increase of 54 percent over sales in the second quarter of 2008. Revenue from Focalin and the Ritalin family of drugs totaled $24.2 million for the second quarter of 2009 compared to $26.2 million over the same period last year.
Product Sales Performance
 
For the first six months of 2009, non-GAAP total revenue was a record $1.227 billion, an increase of 19 percent year-over-year. GAAP total revenue was $1.234 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2009. REVLIMID net sales for the first six months of 2009 reached $759.8 million, an increase of 24 percent over $612.6 million for the same period in 2008. THALOMID net sales for the first six months of 2009 were $219.2 million. VIDAZA net sales for the first six months of 2009 reached $167.4 million.
To support clinical development and to advance global regulatory filings, the company increased R&D investments in multiple international clinical programs around a deepened and diversified pipeline. For the second quarter of 2009, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $169.0 million compared to $133.2 million for the second quarter of 2008. These R&D expenditures continue to support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID, pomalidomide and other IMiDs compounds; VIDAZA; amrubicin, our lead compound for small cell lung cancer; apremilast and our other oral anti-inflammatory compounds; our kinase inhibitor programs; our Activin inhibitor program and placenta-derived stem cell programs. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $218.5 million for the second quarter of 2009 and $144.9 for the same period in 2008, including share-based employee compensation expense and upfront collaborative payments.
Research and Development
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses were $156.9 million for the second quarter of 2009 compared to $162.5 million for the second quarter of 2008. The decrease in expenses was due primarily to the completion of certain initial product launch activities in Europe. On a GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of both 2009 and 2008 were $176.3 million, including share-based employee compensation expense.
Selling, General, and Administrative
For the quarter ended June 30, 2009, interest and other income, net, increased to $28.7 million compared to $20.3 million in the same period in 2008.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
See the attached Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2009 and 2008. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-
Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
recurring items that management does not believe affect the company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define non-GAAP diluted earnings per share amounts as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.
