SUMMIT, NJ  (October 22, 2009) 
Celgene posted non-GAAP net income of $681.0 million or non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.46 during the first nine months of 2009 as compared to non-GAAP net income of $517.9 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.13 in 2008. On a GAAP basis, Celgene reported net income of $522.5 million or earnings per diluted share of $1.12 for the first nine months of 2009, compared to GAAP net loss of $1.384 billion or a loss per diluted share of $3.17 in 2008, which was primarily due to an in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Pharmion Corporation in March 2008.
"All key functional areas  commercial, clinical, regulatory, and operations  executed as planned globally and delivered an exceptional quarter," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sol J. Barer, Ph.D., "We are looking forward to sharing significant clinical data with you across a broad range of Celgene compounds in the fourth quarter that will demonstrate the extraordinary global potential of our deep and diverse clinical pipeline."
Non-GAAP total revenue was a record $692.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, an increase of 18 percent from 2008. GAAP total revenue was $695.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. The increase in total revenue was driven by global market share gains, reimbursement approvals, increased duration of therapy of REVLIMIDand the global growth of VIDAZA. REVLIMID net sales were $449.6 million, an increase of 31 percent over the same period in 2008. THALOMID net sales (inclusive of Thalidomide Pharmion and Thalidomide Celgene) were $110.0 million. VIDAZA net sales were $103.1 million, an increase of 62 percent over sales in the third quarter of 2008. Revenue from Focalin and the Ritalin family of drugs totaled $25.8 million for the third quarter of 2009 compared to $23.8 million over the same period last year.
Product Sales Performance
For the first nine months of 2009, non-GAAP total revenue was a record $1.919 billion, an increase of 19 percent year-over-year. GAAP total revenue was $1.929 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. REVLIMID net sales for the first nine months of 2009 reached $1.209 billion, an increase of 27 percent over $955.2 million for the same period in 2008. THALOMID net sales for the first nine months of 2009 were $329.2 million. Vidaza net sales for the first nine months of 2009 reached $270.5 million, an increase of 97 percent over the same period in 2008, which excludes 2008 Vidaza sales prior to the March 7 acquisition of Pharmion.
 
To support clinical development and to advance global regulatory filings, the company increased R&D investments in multiple international clinical programs. For the third quarter of 2009, non-GAAP R&D expenses, which exclude share-based employee compensation expense, were $178.2 million compared to $149.9 million for the third quarter of 2008. These R&D expenditures continue to support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID, pomalidomide and other IMiDs compounds; VIDAZA; amrubicin, our lead compound for small cell lung cancer; apremilast and our other oral anti-inflammatory compounds; our kinase inhibitor programs; our Activin inhibitor program with ACE-011 and placenta-derived stem cell programs. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $193.4 million for the third quarter of 2009 and $160.9 million for the same period in 2008.
Research and Development
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, which exclude share-based employee compensation expense, were $172.3 million for the third quarter of 2009 compared to $152.0 million for the third quarter of 2008. The increase in expenses was due primarily to unrestricted donations to non-profit organizations for co-pay assistance. On a GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $192.5 million for the third quarter of 2009 compared to $168.6 million for the third quarter of 2008.
Selling, General, and Administrative

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
See the attached Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define non-GAAP diluted earnings per share amounts as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.
