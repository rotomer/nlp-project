SUMMIT, NJ  (January 28, 2010) 
Celgene posted non-GAAP net income of $971.3 million or non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08 during 2009 as compared to non-GAAP net income of $718.8 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.56 in 2008. On a GAAP basis, Celgene reported net income of $776.7 million or diluted earnings per share of $1.66 for 2009, compared to GAAP net loss of $1.534 billion or a diluted loss per share of $3.46 in 2008, which was primarily due to an in-process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of Pharmion Corporation in March 2008.
 
Product Sales Performance
Non-GAAP total revenue was a record $757.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2009, an increase of 22 percent from 2008. GAAP total revenue was $761.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2009. The increase in total revenue was driven by global market share gains, increased duration of therapy of REVLIMID and reimbursement approvals. Net sales of REVLIMID were $497.1 million, an increase of 35 percent over the same period in 2008. Global THALOMID (inclusive of Thalidomide Celgene and Thalidomide Pharmion) and VIDAZA net sales were $107.7 million and $116.7 million, respectively. Revenue from Focalin and the Ritalin family of drugs totaled $27.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $27.9 million over the same period in 2008.
For the full year of 2009, non-GAAP total revenue was a record $2.677 billion, an increase of 20 percent year-over-year. GAAP total revenue was $2.690 billion for 2009. Total non-GAAP net product sales reached a record $2.555 billion, an increase of 21 percent year-over-year. REVLIMID net sales for the full year reached $1.706 billion compared to $1.325 billion in 2008. Global 2009 THALOMID and VIDAZA net sales for the full year were $436.9 million and $387.2 million, respectively.
Research and Development
For the fourth quarter of 2009, non-GAAP R&D expenses, which exclude share-based employee compensation expense, were $181.8 million compared to $153.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, which also excluded the purchase of the VIDAZA royalty obligation. These R&D expenditures continue to support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID, pomalidomide and other IMiDs compounds; VIDAZA; amrubicin, our lead compound for small cell lung cancer; apremilast and our oral anti-inflammatory compounds; our kinase inhibitor programs; our activin inhibitor program with ACE-011; and cellular therapy programs. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $201.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $468.6 million in the same period in 2008.
Selling, General, and Administrative
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, which exclude share-based employee compensation expense, were $193.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $181.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase was primarily due to marketing and sales expenses related to product launch activities of VIDAZA in Europe. On a GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $211.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $200.2 million in the same period in 2008.
Interest and Other Income, Net
For the quarter ended December 31, 2009, interest and other income, net, decreased to $22.0 million compared to $34.9 million in the same period in 2008.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
Celgene reported $2.997 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2009, an increase of $774.7 million from December 31, 2008.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Information
See the attached Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the three-month and full year periods ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define non-GAAP diluted earnings per share amounts as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.
