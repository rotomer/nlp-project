SUMMIT, NJ  (April 29, 2010) 
"Our exceptional first quarter operating results represent the collective efforts of our Celgene team worldwide as we not only continue our global expansion, but also continue our efforts to discover and deliver new therapies," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sol J. Barer, Ph.D. "To this end we highlighted the next generations of Celgene therapies at our recent R&D day and we are aggressively investing in this pipeline to ensure sustainable growth."
 
Product Sales Performance
Non-GAAP total revenue was a record $788.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, an increase of 31 percent from 2009. GAAP total revenue was $791.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. The increase in total revenue was driven by global market share gains and increased duration of therapy of REVLIMID. Net sales of REVLIMID were $530.5 million, an increase of 46 percent over the same period in 2009. Global THALOMID (inclusive of Thalidomide Celgene and Thalidomide Pharmion) and VIDAZA net sales were $104.0 million and $120.3 million, respectively. Revenue from Focalin and the Ritalin family of drugs totaled $29.7 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $27.0 million over the same period in 2009.
Healthcare Reform Legislation
Recently passed U.S. healthcare reform legislation negatively impacted first quarter 2010 revenues by approximately $4 million. The full year 2010 revenue impact is expected to be approximately $35-$40 million. The primary components of the legislation that are expected to impact the Company's business during 2010 include an increase in the Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% and an extension of that rebate to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations.
Research and Development
For the first quarter of 2010, non-GAAP R&D expenses, which exclude share-based employee compensation expense, were $185.5 million compared to $166.5 million for the first quarter of 2009. These R&D expenditures continue to support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID, pomalidomide and other IMiDs compounds; VIDAZA; ISTODAX; amrubicin, our lead compound for small cell lung cancer; apremilast and our oral anti-inflammatory compounds; our kinase inhibitor programs; our activin inhibitor program with ACE-011; and cellular therapy programs. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $204.7 million for the first quarter of 2010 and $181.2 million in the same period in 2009.
Selling, General, and Administrative
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, which exclude share-based employee compensation expense, were $188.0 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $156.6 million for the first quarter of 2009. The increase was primarily due to marketing and sales expenses related to product launch activities of VIDAZA in Europe and the continued expansion of our international commercial activities. On a GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $208.0 million for the first quarter of 2010 and $173.4 million in the same period in 2009.
Interest and Other Income, Net
For the quarter ended March 31, 2010, interest and other income, net, decreased to $17.4 million compared to $49.6 million in the same period in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to reduced net hedging and foreign currency revaluation gains.
 
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
Celgene reported $2.954 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of March 31, 2010.
Non-GAAP Financial Information
See the attached Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2010 and 2009. See the attached Reconciliation of Full-Year 2010 Projected GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at projected non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the year ending December 31, 2010. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define non-GAAP diluted earnings per share amounts as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.
