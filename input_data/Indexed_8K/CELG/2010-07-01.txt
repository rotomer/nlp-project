Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Merger Agreement
On June 30, 2010, Celgene Corporation ("Celgene"), Abraxis BioScience, Inc. ("Abraxis") and Artistry Acquisition Corp., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Celgene ("Merger Sub"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into Abraxis and Abraxis will become a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Celgene (the "Merger").
On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Abraxis (the "Abraxis Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than treasury shares of Abraxis and any shares of Abraxis Common Stock owned by Celgene, Merger Sub or any wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene or Abraxis) will be converted into the right to receive (i) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to $58.00 (the "Cash Consideration"), (ii) 0.2617 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Celgene (the "Celgene Common Stock"), and (iii) one contingent value right (a "CVR") issued by Celgene subject to and in accordance with the CVR Agreement described below (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"). No fractional shares of Celgene Common Stock will be issued in the Merger, and Abraxis stockholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Celgene Common Stock.
All outstanding stock options ("Options"), stock appreciation rights ("SARs") and restricted stock units ("RSUs") of Abraxis will be canceled at the Effective Time. Holders of Options and SARs with an exercise or base price below the Per Share Amount (as defined below) will receive, for each share of Abraxis Common Stock subject to such Option or SAR, (i) a cash payment equal to the difference between the Per Share Amount and the exercise price or base price of the Option or SAR, as applicable, and (ii) one CVR. Holders of Options and SARs with an exercise or base price above the Per Share Amount will be given the right to elect, during a period of at least five business days ending the business day preceding the closing of the Merger, to pay to Abraxis a cash payment equal to the difference between the exercise price or base price of the Option or SAR, as applicable, and the Per Share Amount, and in exchange receive one CVR. Holders of RSUs will receive (i) a cash payment equal to the Per Share Amount and (ii) one CVR. The "Per Share Amount" means the sum of (x) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the Exchange Ratio and (2) the Celgene Share Cash Value (as defined below), with such amount rounded up to the nearest cent, and (y) the Cash Consideration. The "Celgene Share Cash Value" will be an amount equal to the average of the closing sale prices for Celgene Common Stock on NASDAQ, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, for each of the ten consecutive trading days ending with the seventh complete trading day prior to the Effective Time.
Celgene and Abraxis each made representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants by Abraxis to conduct its business in the ordinary course during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and consummation of the Merger. The representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement are made for the purposes of allocation of risk between the parties and as conditions to closing, may be subject to exceptions in a disclosure letter provided before the signing of the Merger Agreement, are not necessarily accurate or complete as made and should not be relied upon by any stockholders or potential investors.
 
The Merger Agreement prohibits Abraxis from soliciting or knowingly encouraging competing acquisition proposals. However, Abraxis may, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, provide information to a third party that makes an unsolicited acquisition proposal, and may engage in discussions and negotiations with a third party that makes an unsolicited acquisition proposal that the Abraxis board of directors determines constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
The consummation of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of Abraxis' stockholders, the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the effectiveness of Celgene's Registration Statement on Form S-4 covering shares of Celgene Common Stock and CVRs to be issued in the Merger, and the approval of such shares of Celgene Common Stock for listing (subject to notice of issuance) on NASDAQ;.
The Merger Agreement also provides for certain termination rights for both Celgene and Abraxis. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Abraxis may be required to pay Celgene a termination fee of $145 million.
Contingent Value Rights Agreement
At the closing of the Merger, Celgene and a mutually acceptable trustee will enter into a Contingent Value Rights Agreement ("CVR Agreement") governing the terms of the CVRs. A holder of a CVR is entitled to receive a pro rata portion of cash payments that Celgene is obligated to pay to all holders of CVRs, as follows:
 
Celgene has agreed to use diligent efforts to achieve each of the Milestones above through the fifth year anniversary of the CVR Agreement and to obtain FDA regulatory approval for the commercial manufacture, marketing and sale of Abraxane for the treatment of melanoma, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer and first-line metastatic breast cancer unless the data generated in an appropriate clinical trial does not support further development of Abraxane for the applicable indication. Celgene has also agreed to use diligent efforts to sell Abraxane or any other the Products for which Celgene has obtained regulatory approval for the commercial manufacture, marketing and sale thereof.
Celgene has also agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the CVRs to be approved for listing for trading on NASDAQ and to maintain such listing for as long as CVRs remain outstanding.
Celgene may, at any time on and after the date that 50% of the CVRs issued pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement either are (i) no longer outstanding, and/or (ii) repurchased, acquired, redeemed or retired by Celgene, redeem all (but not less than all) of the outstanding CVRs at a cash redemption price equal to the average price paid for all CVRs by Celgene in prior transactions.
Voting Agreement
As an inducement to Celgene and as a condition to Celgene entering into the Merger Agreement, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong and related entities holding, in the aggregate, approximately 82% of the issued and outstanding Abraxis Common Stock (the "Principal Stockholders") entered in a Voting Agreement with Celgene and Merger Sub (the "Voting Agreement"), pursuant to which the Principal Stockholders have agreed, subject to the terms thereof, to vote their shares of Abraxis Common Stock in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and against, among other things, any business combination or extraordinary corporate transaction other than the Merger or another business combination or transaction with Celgene or any of its affiliates. The Principal Stockholders also granted Celgene an irrevocable proxy to vote their shares of Abraxis Common Stock in accordance with the preceding sentence.
The Voting Agreement also limits the ability of the Principal Stockholders to sell or otherwise transfer their shares of Abraxis Common Stock, other than to certain permitted transferees. The Voting Agreement will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time, (ii) a material amendment of the Merger Agreement that is adverse to the Principal Stockholders that is not consented to by the Principal Stockholders (including a decrease or change in the form of the Merger Consideration) and (iii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.
Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality Agreement
As an inducement to Celgene and as a condition to Celgene entering into the Merger Agreement, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong entered in a Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality Agreement with Celgene (the "Noncompetition Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, Dr. Soon-Shiong will be generally prohibited, for 10 years from and after the Effective Time, subject to certain exceptions, from owning or otherwise engaging in the business of researching, developing, licensing, manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, importing, using, marketing, distributing, practicing or otherwise exploiting any Albumin-Bound Nab Products (as defined in the Noncompetition Agreement) in the United States and any foreign jurisdiction in which Abraxis was engaged in the business of researching, developing, licensing, manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, importing, using, marketing, distributing, practicing or otherwise exploiting any Albimin-Bound Nab Products as of the Effective Time.
 
Stockholders' Agreement
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain of the Principal Stockholders entered in a Stockholders' Agreement with Celgene (the "Stockholders' Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, the Principal Stockholders have agreed not to sell, pledge or otherwise transfer the Celgene Common Stock to be acquired by them in the Merger (the "Merger Common Stock") for three years following the Effective Time, other than to certain permitted transferees or in connection with a third party tender or exchange offer, merger or similar transaction involving Celgene; provided that after two years the Principal Stockholders may sell up to 25% of the aggregate Merger Common Stock held by all Principal Stockholders immediately after the Effective Time. In addition, the Principal Stockholders have agreed that prior to the fourth anniversary of the Merger, the Principal Stockholders will not sell, pledge or otherwise transfer, in any calendar month, in open market transactions, more than 30% of the aggregate Merger Common Stock held by all Principal Stockholders immediately after the Effective Time.
The foregoing descriptions of the Merger Agreement, the CVR Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Noncompetition Agreement and the Stockholders' Agreement do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 2.1, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4 respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this CVR Agreement and (subject to Section 4.1) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in
 
this Section. The Company may set a record date for purposes of determining the identity of Holders entitled to vote or consent to any action by vote or consent authorized or permitted under this CVR Agreement. If not previously set by the Company, (i) the record date for determining the Holders entitled to vote at a meeting of the Holders shall be the date preceding the date notice of such meeting is mailed to the Holders, or if notice is not given, on the day next preceding the day such meeting is held, and (ii) the record date for determining the Holders entitled to consent to any action in writing without a meeting shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Company. If a record date is fixed, those Persons who were Holders of Securities at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to take such action by vote or consent or, except with respect to clause (d) below, to revoke any vote or consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security or the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof, in respect of anything done, suffered or omitted to be done by the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.

In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this CVR Agreement provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
(b) In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause, it shall be impracticable to mail notice of any event as required by any provision of this CVR Agreement, then any method of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice.

Successors
Section 10.1 .

(a) holders of Senior Obligations will be entitled to receive payment in full in cash or cash equivalents of all Senior Obligations of the Company (including interest after the commencement of any bankruptcy proceeding at the rate specified in the applicable Senior Obligation, whether or not permitted under such bankruptcy proceedings) before the Holders will be entitled to receive any payment of any kind with respect to the Junior Obligations; and
 
(b) until all Senior Obligations of the Company (as provided in clause (a) above) are paid in full in cash or cash equivalents, any distribution to which Holders would be entitled but for this Article 10 will be made to holders of Senior Obligations of the Company, as their interests may appear.
Section 10.3 . The Company may not make any payment or distribution to any Holder in respect of Junior Obligations or acquire from any Holder for cash or property any Junior Obligations:
Default on Senior Obligations
(a) if any default on any Senior Obligations exceeding twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) in aggregate principal amount would occur as a result of such payment, distribution or acquisition;

(d) following the occurrence of any default (other than a payment default, and after the expiration of any applicable grace period) with respect to any Senior Obligations with an aggregate principal amount of more than twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000), the effect of which is to permit the holders of such Senior Obligations (or a trustee or agent acting on their behalf) to cause, with the giving of notice if required, the maturity of such Senior Obligations to be accelerated, for a period commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee (with a copy to the Company) of a written notice of such default from the representative of the holders of such Senior Obligations and ending when such Senior Obligations are paid in full in cash or cash equivalents or, if earlier, when such default is cured or waived.
Section 10.4 .

(b) Any amount received by any Holder as a result of direct or indirect credit support for the Junior Obligations from any Affiliate of the Company shall be treated as payments received by such Holder from the Company that are subject to the provisions of this Article 10.

Section 10.5 . The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any facts known to the Company that would cause a payment of any Junior Obligations to violate this Article 10, but failure to give such notice will not affect the subordination of the Junior Obligations to the Senior Obligations as provided in this Article 10.
Notice by Company
Section 10.6 .
Subordination Effective Notwithstanding Deficiencies with Respect to Senior Obligations; Waiver of Right to Contest Senior Obligation; Reinstatement of Subordination Provisions
(a) The Holders hereby agree that subordination provisions contained in this Article 10 are unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the Senior Obligations, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any holder of Senior Obligations with respect to any provisions thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense. Without limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this CVR Agreement, in the event that the amount of Senior Obligations are reduced or diminished for any reason (other than as a result of the payment in cash or cash equivalents thereof), whether because of the applicability of fraudulent conveyance or other applicable Laws, or any other invalidity or limitation on the amount of Senior Obligations, the subordination provisions thereof shall apply to the full amount of Senior Obligations (without giving effect to any reduction, invalidity or diminution thereof), and the turnover provisions hereunder shall be fully enforceable with respect to the full amount of Senior Obligations (without giving effect to any such reduction, invalidity or diminution thereof), even if the effect thereof is that there will be no (or a limited amount of) Senior Obligations to which the Junior Obligations are subrogated after the payment in full in cash of any of then remaining Senior Obligations (without giving effect to any reductions, invalidity or diminution thereof, except for reductions as a result of payments thereof in cash or cash equivalents).
(b) The Trustee and the Holders agree that they shall not (and hereby waive any right to) take any action to contest or challenge (or assist or support any other Person in contesting or challenging), directly or indirectly, whether or not in any proceeding (including in any proceeding commenced by or against any Person under any provision of Title 11 of the United States Code, as now and hereinafter in effect, or any successor statute or under any other state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency Law, assignments for the benefit of creditors, formal or informal moratoria, compositions, extensions generally with creditors, or proceedings seeking reorganization, arrangement, or other similar relief), the validity or enforceability of the Senior Obligations.
 
(c) If any payment made or in respect to the Senior Obligations must be disgorged or returned for any reason, the Senior Obligations shall be reinstated hereunder and for all purposes of this Article 10 (including, without limitation, the turnover provisions hereof) such payment shall be deemed to have never been made with respect to the Senior Obligations.
Section 10.7 . After all Senior Obligations are paid in full in cash or cash equivalents and until the Junior Obligations are paid in full, Holders will be subrogated to the rights of holders of Senior Obligations to receive distributions applicable to Senior Obligations to the extent that distributions otherwise payable to the Holders have been applied to the payment of Senior Obligations. The Holders by accepting the Securities acknowledge that to the extent that the Senior Obligations are determined to be unenforceable, or the Senior Obligations are subordinated to other obligations of the Company, such subrogation rights may be impaired.
Subrogation
Section 10.8 . This Article 10 defines the relative rights of Holders and holders of Senior Obligations. Nothing in this CVR Agreement will:
Relative Rights
(a) impair, as between the Company and Holders, the obligations of the Company under this CVR Agreement and the Securities; or
(b) affect the relative rights of Holders and creditors of the Company other than their rights in relation to holders of Senior Obligations.
(c) If the Company fails because of this Article 10 to pay any amounts due in respect of the Securities on a due date in violation of Section 8.1, the failure is still an Event of Default.
Section 10.9 . No right of any holder of Senior Obligations to enforce the subordination of the Junior Obligations may be impaired by any act or failure to act by the Company or any Holder or by the failure of the Company or any Holder to comply with this CVR Agreement.
Subordination May Not Be Impaired by Company
Section 10.10 . Whenever a distribution is to be made or a notice given to holders of Senior Obligations, the distribution may be made and the notice given to their representative in accordance with the terms of the instrument or other agreement governing such Senior Obligations. Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in this Article 10, the Trustee and the Holders will be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction or upon any certificate of such representative or of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution to the Trustee or to the Holders for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Obligations and other obligations of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 10.
Distribution or Notice to Representative
 
Section 10.11 . Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 10 or any other provision of this CVR Agreement, the Trustee will not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment or distribution by the Trustee, and the Trustee may continue to make payments on the Securities, unless the Trustee has received at its address for notice specified in Section 1.5 at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date of such payment written notice of facts that would cause the payment of any Junior Obligations to violate this Article 10. Only the Company or a representative of Senior Obligations may give the notice. Nothing in this Article 10 will impair the claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 4.7 hereof. The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may hold Senior Obligations with the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee.
Rights of the Trustee
Section 10.12 . Each Holder, by the Holder's acceptance of the Securities, authorizes and directs the Trustee on such Holder's behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article 10, and appoints the Trustee to act as such Holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. If the Trustee (or any other Person acting on behalf of and at the direction of the Majority Holders) does not file a proper proof of claim or proof of debt in the form required in any proceeding referred to in Section 8.2 hereof at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, the representatives of the Senior Obligations are hereby authorized to file an appropriate claim for and on behalf of the Holders of the Securities.
Authorization to Effect Subordination
Section 10.13 . The provisions of this Article 10 are expressly made for the benefit of the holders from time to time of the Senior Obligations, and may not be amended or modified without the written consent of the representatives of the holders of all Senior Obligations.
Amendments
Section 11.1 . If the Company elects to redeem Securities pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of Section 11.6 hereof, it shall furnish to the Trustee, at least forty five (45) days (unless a shorter period shall be agreed to by the Trustee) but not more than sixty (60) days before a redemption date (but in any event prior to the notice provided pursuant to Section 11.3 hereof), an Officer's Certificate (a "") setting forth (i) the clause of this CVR Agreement pursuant to which the redemption shall occur, (ii) the redemption date, (iii) the amount of CVRs to be redeemed and (iv) the redemption price.

In the event of partial redemption by lot, the particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected, unless otherwise provided herein, not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption date by the Trustee from the outstanding Securities not previously called for redemption.

(f) the clause of this CVR Agreement pursuant to which the Securities called for redemption are being redeemed; and
(g) that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP and ISIN number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Securities.
At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption in the Company's name and at its expense; provided, however, that the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee at least forty five (45) days (unless a shorter period shall be agreed to by the Trustee) but not more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption date, an Officer's Certificate requesting that the Trustee give such notice and setting forth the information to be stated in such notice as provided in the preceding paragraph.
Section 11.4 . Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 11.3 hereof, Securities called for redemption shall become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption date at the redemption price. A notice of redemption shall be deemed to be given when mailed, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. In any event, failure to give such notice, or any defect in such notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of the Securities held by Holders to whom such notice was properly given.
Effect of Notice of Redemption

If any Security called for redemption or subject to purchase shall not be so paid upon surrender for redemption or purchase because of the failure of the Company to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid redemption price from the redemption date or Purchase Date, as applicable, until such redemption price is paid at the Shortfall Interest Rate.
Section 11.6 . The Company may, at any time on and after the Redemption Eligibility Date, redeem all (but not less than all) of the outstanding Securities at a cash redemption price equal to the average price paid per Security for all Securities previously purchased by the Company calculated as of the Business Day immediately prior to the date of the Call Notice mailed by the Company in accordance with Section 11.3 hereof.
