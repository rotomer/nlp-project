Celgene posted non-GAAP net income of $617.8 million or non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.32 during the first six months of 2010 as compared to non-GAAP net income of $421.2 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.90 in 2009. On a GAAP basis, Celgene reported net income of $389.8 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.83 for the first six months of 2010, compared to GAAP net income of $305.7 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.65 in 2009.
 
"These outstanding results reflect the effectiveness of our operating strategies and the exceptional execution of our global team," said Robert J. Hugin, Chief Executive Officer of Celgene Corporation. "Our portfolio of products and promising hematology and immune-inflammatory pipeline position us to make an increasingly meaningful impact on the lives of patients suffering from serious unmet medical conditions. By combining operational excellence with innovative science, we are strategically positioned to produce sustained long-term growth."
Non-GAAP total revenue was a record $850.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, an increase of 36 percent from 2009. GAAP total revenue was $852.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2010. The increase in total revenue was driven by global market share gains and increased duration of therapy of REVLIMID. Net sales of REVLIMID were $587.1 million, an increase of 48 percent over the same period in 2009. Global THALOMID (inclusive of Thalidomide Celgene and Thalidomide Pharmion) and VIDAZA net sales were $97.8 million and $131.8 million, respectively. Revenue from Focalin and the Ritalin family of drugs totaled $27.0 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $24.2 million over the same period in 2009.
Product Sales Performance
For the first six months of 2010, non-GAAP total revenue was a record $1.639 billion, an increase of 34 percent year-over-year. GAAP total revenue was $1.644 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2010. REVLIMID net sales for the first six months of 2010 reached $1.118 billion, an increase of 47 percent over $759.8 million for the same period in 2009. THALOMID net sales for the first six months of 2010 were $201.8 million. Vidaza net sales for the first six months of 2010 reached $252.1 million, an increase of 51 percent over the same period in 2009.
For the second quarter of 2010, non-GAAP R&D expenses, which exclude upfront collaboration payments and share-based employee compensation expense, were $201.6 million compared to $169.0 million for the second quarter of 2009. These R&D expenditures continue to support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID, pomalidomide and other IMiDs compounds; VIDAZA; ISTODAX; amrubicin; apremilast and our oral anti-inflammatory compounds; our kinase inhibitor programs; our activin inhibitor program with ACE-011; and cellular therapy programs. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $342.8 million for the second quarter of 2010 and $218.5 million in the same period in 2009.
Research and Development
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, which exclude share-based employee compensation expense, were $197.1 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $156.9 million for the second quarter of 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in donations to non-profit foundations, in addition to marketing and sales expenses related to the continued expansion of our international commercial activities. On a GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $219.3 million for the second quarter of 2010 and $176.3 million in the same period in 2009.
Selling, General, and Administrative
For the quarter ended June 30, 2010, interest and other income, net, decreased to $4.6 million compared to $28.7 million in the same period in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest and investment income as well as a loss on net hedging and foreign currency revaluation in the quarter ended June 30, 2010, compared to a gain in the same period in 2009.
Interest and Other Income, Net
 
Celgene reported $3.145 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of June 30, 2010.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
See the attached Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009. See the attached Reconciliation of Full-Year 2010 Projected GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at projected non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the year ending December 31, 2010. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define non-GAAP diluted earnings per share amounts as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.
