On a GAAP basis, Celgene reported net income of $670.9 million, or diluted earnings per share of $1.44 for the first nine months of 2010, compared to GAAP net income of $522.5 million, or diluted earnings per share of $1.12 in 2009.
 
"Our third quarter results reflect outstanding operational execution by our global team," said Bob Hugin, Celgene's Chief Executive Officer. "Our expanding portfolio of innovative therapies in oncology and immune-inflammatory diseases further positions us for sustained growth and value creation in the near and long term."
Non-GAAP total revenue was a record $908.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, an increase of 31 percent from 2009. GAAP total revenue was $910.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. The increase in total revenue was driven by global market share gains and increased duration of therapy of REVLIMID and VIDAZA. Net sales of REVLIMID were $641.3 million, an increase of 43 percent over the same period in 2009. VIDAZA net sales were $141.4 million, an increase of 37 percent from 2009. Global THALOMID (inclusive of Thalidomide Celgene and Thalidomide Pharmion) sales were $94.2 million, a 14 percent decrease from 2009. Revenue from Focalin and the Ritalin family of drugs totaled $22.6 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $25.8 million over the same period in 2009.
Product Sales Performance
For the first nine months of 2010, non-GAAP total revenue was a record $2.547 billion, an increase of 33 percent year-over-year. GAAP total revenue was $2.554 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010. REVLIMID net sales for the first nine months of 2010 were $1.759 billion, an increase of 45 percent over $1.209 billion for the same period in 2009. VIDAZA net sales for the first nine months of 2010 were $393.6 million, an increase of 46 percent over the same period in 2009. THALOMID net sales for the first nine months of 2010 were $296.0 million, a decrease of 10 percent from the same period in 2009. Revenue from Focalin and the Ritalin family of drugs totaled $79.3 million for the first nine months of 2010, an increase of 3 percent over the same period in 2009.
For the third quarter of 2010, non-GAAP R&D expenses, which exclude upfront collaboration payments and share-based employee compensation expense, were $232.3 million compared to $178.2 million for the third quarter of 2009. These R&D expenditures continue to support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID, pomalidomide, and other compounds; VIDAZA; ISTODAX; amrubicin; apremilast and our oral anti-inflammatory compounds; our kinase inhibitor programs; our activin inhibitor program with ACE-011; and cellular therapy programs. On a GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $253.5 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $193.4 million in the same period in 2009.
Research and Development
Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, which exclude share-based employee compensation expense, were $204.1 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to $172.3 million for the third quarter of 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing and sales related expenses resulting from ongoing product launch activities of VIDAZA in Europe and ISTODAX in the United States as well as higher facilities costs. On a GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $228.3 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $192.5 million in the same period in 2009.
Selling, General, and Administrative
For the quarter ended September 30, 2010, interest and other income, net, decreased to $20.8 million compared to $34.9 million in the same period in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest and investment income as well as a decrease in net hedging and foreign currency revaluation gains in the quarter ended September 30, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009.
Interest and Other Income, Net
 
Celgene reported $3.530 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2010.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
See the attached Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009. See the attached Reconciliation of Full-Year 2010 Projected GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income for an explanation of the amounts excluded and included to arrive at projected non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share amounts for the year ending December 31, 2010. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for similar GAAP items. We define non-GAAP diluted earnings per share amounts as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Our definition of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share may differ from similarly named measures used by others.
